Alan H.Palmer was born in London. He was educated at Oxford and INSEAD and has spent most of his career working for international advertising agency groups in London and Paris. He first came across Interactifs in 2004 and was instantly persuaded of the effectiveness of the company’s approach, its applicability across national boundaries – and its capacity, in a modest way, to contribute to the sum total of human happiness.
