Beverly Kaye is an internationally recognized authority on career issues, and retention and engagement in the workplace. As founder and CEO of Career Systems International, ASTD’s 2010 recipient of the Distinguished Contribution to Workplace Learning and Performance Award, and a bestselling author on workplace performance, Dr. Kaye has worked with a host of organizations to establish cutting-edge, award-winning talent development solutions. Her first book, Up Is Not the Only Way became a classic. In it she foresaw the effects that leaner, flatter organizations would have on individual careers and the subsequent need for workers to take charge of their own careers. With the fourth edition of Love ‘Em or Lose ‘Em: Getting Good People to Stay, a bestseller she coauthored, Bev once again proved to be a pioneer in addressing one of the most pressing workplace problems of the 21st century: retaining and engaging employees. In her follow-up companion bestseller, Love It, Don’t Leave It: 26 Ways to Get What You Want at Work, she shows employees how they can find greater satisfaction in their current work lives.
