I am a senior writer for Bloomberg Businessweek and the author of “The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon” – a book about the creation and amazing growth of the very website you are now reading. Over the last few years, I have authored over a dozen cover stories for Businessweek on companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo, Twitter, Costco and the Chinese search firm Baidu. I joined the magazine from the New York Times, where I covered Silicon Valley from the newspaper’s San Francisco bureau. Before that, I was a reporter for the once proud magazine known as Newsweek. I am also the author of a previous work of non-fiction, Gearheads, which the San Francisco Chronicle selected as one of the best books of 2003.
