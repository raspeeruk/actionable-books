Carissa Reiniger is dedicated to entrepreneurship. Having built Silver Lining Ltd from concept to an international company with revenue in the millions in just over one year, Carissa has lived through the growing pains and pleasures of fast growth entrepreneurship. One of the things that Carissa loves about Silver Lining is the fact that everything we do involves other people â€“ we are highly collaborative and that offers us the opportunity to be learning all the time, giving all the time and getting better together, with others.
