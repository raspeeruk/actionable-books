When Chris Bailey graduated University, he received two full-time job offers, but decided to decline them both to dedicate a full year of his life to exploring his weird passion: productivity. For a full year he did anything and everything to become more productive. That included conducting dozens of productivity experiments on himself, like living in total isolation for 10 days, only using his smartphone for an hour a day, waking up at 5:30am every morning, and working 90-hour weeks. Over his project and over the last decade, Chris Bailey has researched and experimented with every productivity technique under the sun to discover what works and what doesnâ€™t.
