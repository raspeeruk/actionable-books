Whether speaking to groups or coaching executives, Cyndi is a master communicator and facilitator. A graduate of Northwestern University in Communication Studies, she finds the right blend of theory and application to encourage learning, retention and fun. Over the past 30 years, Cyndi has spoken throughout the nation and coached executives to higher levels. She is the coauthor of six books, including Fearless Facilitation: How to Engage and Involve Your Audience (Pfeiffer/Wiley), Ten Steps to Successful Time Managment (ASTD Press), Speak Up! A Woman’s Guide to Presenting Like a Pro and Present Like a Pro (St. Martin’s Press) – all with Kevin E. O’Connor. In It’s Your Move: Dealing Yourself the Best Cards in Life and Work, (FT/Prentice Hall 2003) with Jill Bremer, she shares the key strategies that winners use to thrive in today’s fast-paced work environment. She inspires people to take initiative with step-by-step game plans to propel them to success. Cyndi lives in Chicago where her active young adult children and Labrador Retriever, Max Maxey, add both chaos and balance to her life.
