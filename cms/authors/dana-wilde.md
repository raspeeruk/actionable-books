Dana Wilde is the author of Train Your Brain: How to Build a Million Dollar Business in Record Time.

She breaks down the Cycle of Perpetual Sameness â€“ the number one reason why most people only experience incremental change in their lives and their businesses. Dana provides the much-needed blueprint to help you get off this counterproductive cycle and how to do it quickly. Her program of the same name has been used by thousands of small business owners and continues to be her #1 selling training.
