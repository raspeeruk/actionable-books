I was born in Michigan, but lived in San Miguel Acatán, Guatemala with a tribe of Mayan indians until I was eighteen years old, after which I moved to the United States. I spent six years in graduate school, earning an advanced degree in ancient languages and theology. I’ve taught at the undergraduate and graduate level.
