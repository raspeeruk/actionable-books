David Kantor is an American systems psychologist, organizational consultant, and clinical researcher. Kantor has been a professor at Harvard University, Harvard University Medical School, and Tufts University Medical School. He is the founder of three research and training institutes, the author of numerous books and articles, and the inventor of a series of psychometric instruments that provide insight into individual and group behaviors. His groundbreaking empirical research revealed a fundamental structure to all communication, known as Structural Dynamics, which provides the solution to the most common communication challenges experienced in any human system. In 2014, Kantor and his long-time collaborator Shani Harmon, launched The Kantor Institute to make consulting tools and products based on Structural Dynamics available to trained practitioners.
