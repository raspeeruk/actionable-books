Don Norman is a leader in the application of human-centered design. Business Week has listed him as one of the world’ s 27 most influential designers. “All design,” says Norman, “whether of a product, a company, a service or an experience is ultimately aimed at satisfying human and societal needs.” This approach requires the application of knowledge of cognitive science, engineering, and business with the skills and knowledge of the design field, helping companies produce products and services that satisfy human and societal needs, both practical and emotional. Norman is Director of the recently established Design Lab at the University of California, San Diego where he is also professor emeritus of both psychology and cognitive science. He is cofounder of the Nielsen Norman Group, an executive consulting firm that helps companies produce human-centered products and services.
