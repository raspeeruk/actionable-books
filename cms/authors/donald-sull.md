Don Sull teaches strategy at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He was formerly a Professor at London Business School and Harvard University, where he earned his bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees. The Economist and Fortune have identified him among the next generation of management gurus.

He discovered the power of simple rules when working as an undersized bouncer in a biker bar.
