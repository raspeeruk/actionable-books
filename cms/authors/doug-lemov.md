The book is my best effort to describe not what theory says you should do to “win” in the classroom–especially in the toughest ones–but what the very best teachers actually do–those who take kids of poverty and reliably make high achievers out of them. To write Teach Like a Champion I watched thousands of classes and videos of classes taught by teachers with incredible results, and I put everything I thought I saw them doing through the “Monday Test.” If I felt it wasn’t something I (or you) could do at 8:25am on Monday morning, it was out.
