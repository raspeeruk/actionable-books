Dr. Cloud is a clinical psychologist with a unique ability to connect with his audiences. Drawing upon his broad range of experiences in private practice, leadership consulting, and media, he simplifies life’s issues and gives easy to understand, practical advice. It is Dr. Cloud’s humour, compassion, and “in the moment” confrontation that make his approach to psychology and spirituality such a success.
