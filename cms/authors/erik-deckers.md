I’ve been the co-owner and VP of Content Marketing for Professional Blog Service in Indianapolis since 2008, joining the company just a few months before I became one of the owners. Before that, I worked as the director of sales and marketing for a direct mail firm, the crisis communications director for the Indiana State Department of Health, the marketing director for a company that made screen reading software for blind people, and the marketing director for a poultry equipment company. All in all, I’ve spent the last 20 years in sales, marketing, and PR, keeping up with new marketing developments, learning Internet marketing, and teaching myself SEO.
