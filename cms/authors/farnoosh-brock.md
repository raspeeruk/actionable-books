Farnoosh Brock was born and raised in Tehran, Iran, has also lived in Turkey and now resides in the United States. In 2011, she left a 12-year successful career at a Fortune 100 company to start her own company, Prolific Living Inc. Today, she is a professional blogger, author, speaker, business coach and an expert green juicer. She is passionate about showing her readers and clients how to define their own freedom in their health and their careers. She is a multi-passionate entrepreneur that does not believe you need to give up one passion to pursue another! She infuses her love of green juicing, Ashtanga yoga, writing, photography, entrepreneurship, and world travel into her work to show you that your dreams are accessible and possible too. Her favorite quote, the one that led to that resignation from Corporate America is: “The lust for comfort kills the passions of the soul.” by Khalil Gibran.
