A law graduate, with a passion for sales, Gavin’s career has focused on working with some of the UK’s leading media operators, including Capital Radio and Emap, and ending his sales career as Client Services Director for Emap. Gavin has trained most of the leading National and Regional Press players, as well as much of the Radio and Online community. As a Master Practitioner of NLP, Certified Trainer of NLP and Insights Accredited Discovery Practitioner, Gavin’s training style is informal, yet focused on results. Gavin built Apex Training into a leading training company in the UK and was nominated for the National Training Awards. Gavin’s biggest weakness as a presenter is that he can sometimes go on a bit about his kids, who have recently begun to dominate his anecdotes.
