Before immigrating to the United States at age eleven, I lived in Germany. My fascination with human behavior began as an eight year old who read–under bed covers by flashlight and against strict maternal instructions–mythological stories and Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina. They fired my imagination and a hunger to understand people. Since I wanted to solve the puzzle of people losing their early enthusiasm for learning, I became an educator. Starting in academia–I have a Master’s degree in French Literature and speak three languages fluently–and then moving into the world of business–first as a consultant, then as an internationally certified executive and team coach with clients in North America, Europe, and Australia–I got interested in unconventional models of learning.
