When Jacob graduated college with honors and a double major, he thought the world was his oyster. At his first job he was promised an exciting opportunity to work on interesting projects and travel the U.S., instead he was stuck doing data entry and creating power-point presentations while commuting 1.5 hours each way. The day the CEO asked him to get coffee was the day he knew he had to get out of there. Since then, Jacob has been fascinated with how the world of work is changing and has been studying it ever since. Jacob went off on his shortly after that experience and hasnâ€™t worked for anyone else ever since.
