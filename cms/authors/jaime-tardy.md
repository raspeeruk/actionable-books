Jaime Tardy is a business coach and speaker who helps entrepreneurs to achieve their goals. She is the founder of EventualMillionaire.com, a website that features a new millionaire interview each week that focuses on personal finance and entrepreneurship. She made her exit from the corporate world after finding herself $70,000 in debt and realizing that she hated her job. With an ambitious goal and a strategic plan, she was out of debt and out of the job she hated in just 16 months. Now, Tardy is helping others to find freedom, money and work they love. She has been featured on CNN, MSN, Kiplinger’s, Fox Business and Yahoo!’s homepage.
