Jamie Notter started his career in the field of international conflict resolution. He spent six years designing and delivering training programs in areas of ethnic conflict (if you get a chance, ask him about the awesome people on the island of Cyprus). Jamie then moved into working with organizations, initially as a diversity trainer and consultant, and later commanding his private management consulting practice, working extensively with trade associations and professional societies. In 2008 Jamie merged his company with MSP (an association management company) to create the consulting division. Jamie carries a masterâ€™s degree in conflict resolution from George Mason University, and a Certificate in Organization Development from Georgetown. An avid writer, he has authored dozens of published articles to go along with a 2007 e-book Generational Diversity in the Workplace and in 2006 published We Have Always Done It That Way: 101 Things About Associations We Must Change. Jamie is a Vice President at Management Solutions Plus, where he leads the consulting division.
