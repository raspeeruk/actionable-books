JANET KESTIN and NANCY VONK spent thirteen years as co-chief creative officers of Ogilvy & Mather Toronto. They delivered world-beating results for global brands like Unilever and Kraft, including Cannes Grand Prix-winning work for Dove‚Äôs Campaign for Real Beauty and a Grand Clio for ‚ÄúDiamond Shreddies.‚Äù They are the authors of Pick Me, the ad industry advice column ‚ÄúAsk Jancy‚Äù and frequent contributors to several publications, including Fast Company. In 2012, they were named among Ad Age‚Äôs 100 Most Influential Women in Advertising. Now with Swim, their new creative leadership lab, they approach leadership training a little differently. Well, a lot differently.
