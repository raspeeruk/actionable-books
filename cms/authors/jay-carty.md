An ‚Äúunusual communicator‚Äù is a mild statement. Maybe a little ‚Äúnuts‚Äù would be more accurate. He‚Äôs certainly ‚Äúoff the wall.‚Äù Not a preacher, not a teacher‚Ä¶ more a story teller with a very important message. Fun, funny and provocative. Traditional, he is not. Challenging, he is. Where some ‚Äúdeep‚Äù preachers are too snoozy for the rank and file, and where some humorists don‚Äôt have much to say, Jay‚Äôs ‚Äústuff‚Äù is generally regarded as an unusual blending of humor and content. Youth won‚Äôt nod off, and neither will their parents. Jay Carty played basketball at Oregon State and coached there for two years. He was on John Wooden‚Äôs staff for three years at UCLA and coached Kareem Abdul Jabbar. Jay then played for the Los Angeles Lakers. Following basketball and a time in the business world, Jay directed a Christian conference center, was a church consultant with Churches Alive and in 1982 began Yes! Ministries, an organization dedicated to helping people say ‚Äúyes!‚Äù to God. Jay crosses denominations and relates to a changing contemporary society as well as a broad range of age groups. Jay has spoken in churches, colleges, schools and retreat centers across the country. Jay and Mary make their home in Santa Barbara. They have two grown children.
