Jeff Howe is the author, with Media Lab Director Joi Ito, of Whiplash: How to Survive Our Faster Future. A longtime contributing editor at Wired magazine, he coined the term crowdsourcing in a 2006 article for that magazine, and in 2008, he published a book with Random House that looked more deeply at the phenomenon of massive online collaboration. Called Crowdsourcing: How the Power of the Crowd is Driving the Future of Business, it has been translated into ten languages.
