As a teacher, writer, researcher, and coach, Jennifer Garvey Berger helps individuals and teams to transform themselves and their organizations, to see bigger perspectives, to think in more creative ways, and to collaborate to come up with collective ideas. With her partners at Cultivating Leadership, Jennifer runs transformational leadership programs and supports organizations to use their leaders (and leadership development) to encourage and support whole-of-organization change. Jennifer has worked with executives in a wildly diverse set of organizations like Microsoft, Fidelity Investments, the New Zealand Department of Conservation, and Lion, helping leaders increase their own capacity to think well about problems and people.
