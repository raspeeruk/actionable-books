Jim Collins is a student and teacher of enduring great companies — how they grow, how they attain superior performance, and how good companies can become great companies. Having invested over a decade of research into the topic, Jim has authored or co-authored four books, including the classic “Built To Last,” which has been a fixture on the “Business Week” bestseller list for more than six years, and has been translated into 29 languages. His work has been featured in “Fortune,” “The Wall Street Journal,” “Business Week,” “Harvard Business Review,” and “Fast Company.”
