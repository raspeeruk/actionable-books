As editor-in-chief and director, Jocelyn K. Glei leads the 99U in its mission to provide the “missing curriculum” on making ideas happen. She oversees the 99u.com website–which has won two Webby Awards for Best Cultural Blog–and leads the curation and execution of the popular 99U Conference, which has presented talks from visionary creatives including Jack Dorsey, John Maeda, Brené Brown, Jonathan Adler, Stefan Sagmeister, Jad Abumrad, AJ Jacobs, and many more. She is also the editor of the 99U book series, which includes Manage Your Day-to-Day (May 2013) and Maximize Your Potential (due Sept 2013).
