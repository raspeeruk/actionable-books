Before becoming an author of business books and historical fiction, John Bell was a CEO, global strategy consultant, and a director of several private, public, and not-for-profit organizations. A prolific blogger, John’s musings on strategy, leadership, and branding have appeared in various journals such as Fortune, Forbes and ceoafterlife.com. “Do Less Better. The Power of Strategic Sacrifice in a Complex World,” was released by Palgrave Macmillan USA in January, 2015. This book teaches leaders how to recognize the complexity within their businesses and reveals how they can simplify and streamline through specialization and sacrifice. For leaders, innovators, and entrepreneurs who need help embracing the practices that foster agility, foresight, and resilience, “Do Less Better” provides a tool-kit of road-tested strategies.
