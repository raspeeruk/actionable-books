Laurence Endersen spent his childhood in Mallow, a town in the south of Ireland, and now lives with his family in Dublin. Pebbles of Perception is his first book. It is an exploration of the more important decisions in life. Inspired by the teachings of Charlie Munger, the book is an invitation to Be Curious, Build Character and to make Better Choices.
