I began writing over decade ago when I was fortunate to team up with Ken Blanchard on “The Secret: What Great Leaders Know and Do.” In 2011 I released “The Secret of Teams” outlining the key principles that enable some teams to outperform the all the rest. “Great Leaders Grow: Becoming a Leader for Life” came next in 2012, followed by “The Heart of Leadership” in October 2013, and then the 10th Anniversary Edition of “The Secret” on September 2, 2014.
