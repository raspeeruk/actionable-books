Nancy Calderon is a Global Lead Partner with KPMG and has written Women on Board with Susan Stautberg of WomenCorporateDirectors. Nancyâ€™s vision is to share her insights from her board service, from California to New York to India, and to motivate future women directors to frame their experiences earlier in their careers in order to be best qualified to serve on a corporate board. For those board members already serving, the stories and anecdotes from Nancy, Susan and numerous other board members will help you and your board excel.
