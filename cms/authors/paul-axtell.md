Paul Axtell provides consulting and personal effectiveness training to a wide variety of clients, from Fortune 500 companies and universities to nonprofit organizations and government agencies. A large focus of his work is how to run effective and productive meetings–to turn them from the calendar items ­people dread into useful, productive sessions with measurable results. The last twenty years have been devoted to designing and leading programs that enhance individual and group performance within large organizations.
