A journalist since 1983, Paul Roberts writes and lectures frequently on the complex interplay of business, technology, psychology, and the natural world. His most recent book, “The Impulse Society: America in the Age of Instant Gratification,” examines the accelerating and increasingly intimate — and troubling — relationship between the marketplace and the Self.
