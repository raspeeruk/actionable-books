Riane Eisler is internationally known for her bestseller The Chalice and The Blade, now in 25 foreign editions, as well as Sacred Pleasure, The Power of Partnership, and Tomorrow’s Children. Her newest book, The Real Wealth of Nations — hailed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu as “a template for the better world we have been so urgently seeking” and by Gloria Steinem as “revolutionary” – proposes a new approach to economics that gives visibility and value to the most essential human work: the work of caring for people and for our natural environment.
