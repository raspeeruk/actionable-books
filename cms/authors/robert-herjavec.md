Robert Herjavec began his career with IBM mainframe sales but founded his own business in 1990 − BRAK Systems Inc. − one of North America´s first and foremost security integrators. BRAK was responsible for bringing technologies such as Checkpoint and ISS to Canada; it quickly grew into the largest security integrator in Canada and ranked on the Profit 100 as one of the country´s fastest growing companies.
