Hello. My name is Robert Pagliarini. I have the great honor of helping people during one of the most exciting and nerve-wracking times in their lives. I have specialized in managing, growing, and protecting clientsâ€™ sudden wealth for nearly two decades. My investment and wealth management firm, Pacifica Wealth Advisors, serves clients across the country and around the globe. We have developed a reputation for our specialized work with sudden wealth from inheritance, divorce, legal judgment/settlement, stock options, business sale, sport/entertainment contract, and the lottery.
