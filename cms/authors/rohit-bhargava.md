Hi, my name is Rohit Bhargava. This is my author page, and my chance to tell you a bit more about myself, so here it goes. I knew I wanted to be a writer after I wrote my first screenplay at 16 years old. While I didnâ€™t end up writing movies, for the past decade I have been working as a marketing consultant to help companies to be more human and tell better (and more truthful) stories.
