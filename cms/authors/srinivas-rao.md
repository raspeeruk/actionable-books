I’m Srinivas Rao (aka. “Srini”), the host and co-founder of BlogcastFM, a podcast where I interview business experts, best selling authors, and successful entrepreneurs. Since starting BlogcastFM in February 2010, I’ve interviewed over 250 of the world’s most successful bloggers, authors, and internet entrepreneurs. Former guests on the podcast include Danielle Laporte, Ramit Sethi, Julien Smith, Mike Stelzner, Chris Guillebeau, and many others. Today the show has over 120 5-star reviews in iTunes and receives over 80,000 downloads a month.
