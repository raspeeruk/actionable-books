Ted Matthews may have persuaded adidas to bring back The Three Stripes and convinced Energizer not to kill the bunny, but as Canada‚Äôs original and foremost Brand coach, he continually pushes his clients to understand that Brand is not the logo, the website or the advertising. A Brand is what people think of you‚Ñ¢.As an entrepreneur, Ted built Promanad Communications into an 80-person firm that, over a span of 30 years, served an extensive list of blue chip clients. When it became clear that most professionals operate as if a Brand really is merely the logo, he sold Promanad and founded Instinct Brand Equity Coaches. Drawing on his own experience as a CEO, Ted teaches his clients to embed, throughout the organizational culture, instinctive behaviors that help their Brands earn a spot in the minds and hearts of increasingly discerning stakeholders.Ted‚Äôs dogged pursuit of the Instinct Mission ‚Äì to challenge and support business leaders to maximize the potential within their Brands ‚Äì has spurred some of the most successful Brand evolutions in North America. He has been an integral force behind the Brand-building efforts of organizations like adidas, Manulife, Oxford Properties, Strata Health, AtlasCare, Quadrangle, IAMGOLD, PICKSEED, Investment Planning Counsel, Steam Whistle Breweries and ornge.Ted challenges his clients to maximize the potential within their Brands by embracing the lessons of his book ‚Äì Brand: It Ain‚Äôt the Logo\* ‚Äì a Globe & Mail 2011 bestseller.For his pearls of wisdom and famously entertaining style, Ted is a sought- after speaker for business schools, corporations and professional associations. Helping lay the groundwork for future Branding excellence and building from his 18 year involvement with the Young Presidents Organization(YPO), he also makes time to coach young entrepreneurs.While Ted Brands himself a master woodworker, his wife Marsha is more likely to call it, ‚Äúmaking sawdust‚Äù. The two live between the island cottage he built in Muskoka and the desert home they designed together near Phoenix.
