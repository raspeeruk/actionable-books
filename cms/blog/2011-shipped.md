Last December, [Seth posted his #yearinreview](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/yearinreview.html) which prompted to me to create and [post my own](http://actionablebooks.com/yearinreview-as-inspired-by-seth/). I think it’s a great exercise, and have found myself thinking about it sporadically throughout 2011. Reminding myself that I would posting my “Shipped” work in Dec 2011 kept me focused, persistent and action oriented.

So, without any further ado, here’s my list of professional projects shipped in 2011:

*   Wrote and Posted 18 Actionable Summaries
*   Edited and Posted 27 [Guest-written](http://actionablebooks.com/writers/) Actionable Summaries
*   Created six brand new workshops for [Actionable Workshops](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops)
*   Interviewed 11 Best Selling Business Book Authors, completing the “[From the Horse’s Mouth](http://actionablebooks.com/media/videos/author-interviews/)” series (24 interviews in 24 months)
*   Spoke at 6 public events
*   Completed our [_Salaried Entrepreneur Team Assessment_](http://actionablebooks.com/seta-intro) tool (SETA) and made it available for free.
*   Ran our first (and subsequent 4) trade show booth events.
*   Led the creation of our first infographic, explaining the need for _Salaried Entrepreneurs_.
*   Created and ran our first [Actionable Coaches](http://actionablebooks.com/actionable-workshop-resources/) Training Class
*   Organized and Hosted our first two quarterly _Actionable_ employee retreats

Virtually nothing on this list would have been possible without the help and support of the very talented team I have the pleasure of working with: [Mijay](http://actionablebooks.com/writers/mijay-pavon/), [Andy](http://actionablebooks.com/writers/andy-budgell/), Dan, Shawn, the boys (and girl!) at [Jet Cooper](http://www.jetcooper.com), the terrific guest writers and coaches who constitute a large part of our tribe, our wonderful clients (who truly are some of my favorite people to have conversations with) and others I’ve had the pleasure of interacting with this year.

Interestingly, it’s the last two on the list above that were the most enjoyable to complete. Connecting with like minded people – be them employees, contractors, vendors or what have you – is an amazingly rejuvenating and rewarding experience. Which is perhaps why my most exciting project “shipped” this year happened on May 7th, when I married my wife – the most like minded and passion driven person I know.

**So, you’re turn: What did you ship this year?** (started projects don’t count – only the ones you actually completed)
