2016 is already zipping by at a rapid clip, and Q1 is winding down (scary, huh?). Back in January I proposed a [Reading Challenge](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/2016-reading-challenge/) for those of you who want to be more intentional about your reading this year. Now seems as good a time as any for a check-in to see how you’re all doing.

If you need a refresher on the challenge, it’s all about setting small, _doable_ (yes, emphasis on doable) steps to help you get more reading in, whatever that looks like for you. This isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. For some of you it might be reading a set number of books for the entire year, while for others it might be setting aside 30 minutes at a fixed time each day to sit down with a good book. It’s whatever works for you and your lifestyle.

So, how is it going? What approach is working for you—or isn’t? Full disclosure (I know I’m in a judgement free zone here among friends!), I found it difficult to get going in the New Year. The first few weeks of 2016 were a bit overwhelming, as they are for most. Setting aside a fixed time each day has been working for me for two months, and I’m happy to say that now I’m back on track. If your goal has become a little derailed or reading has been put on the backburner, now is a great time to make some adjustments to your plan so that you’re successful by the end of the year.

What’s the one book that’s resonated most with you so far this year? Is it Michael Bungay Stanier’s [_The Coaching Habit_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-coaching-habit/)? Or perhaps [_Under New Management_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/under-new-management/) by David Burkus? And if you’re looking for some inspiration for what book to pick up next, check out our archive of 880+ free book [summaries](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/) written by our incredible roster of writers.
