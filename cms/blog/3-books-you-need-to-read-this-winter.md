With the cold weather keeping many of us indoors, now is a great time to delve into some great new books. Here are three upcoming books due out this winter by some of our favourite thought leaders that are sure to both inspire and take your mind off the winter chill in equal measure.

**_The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever_** by Michael Bungay Stanier

Daniel H. Pink and Brené Brown are just two big name authors singing Michael Bungay Stanier’s praises over the upcoming publication of _The Coaching Habit_. Full disclosure: We’ve had a chance to read _The Coaching Habit_ and it completely lives up to the hype. It’s an indispensable resource for any leader that allows coaching to be “a regular, informal part of your day so managers and their teams can work less hard and have more impact.”

**_Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World_** by Adam Grant

Adam Grant, the highly influential author behind [_Give and Take_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/give-and-take/), is back with a followup: _Originals_. In it he explains how non-conformists are the force behind true change and offers advice on how we can “originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all.” It’s one read you won’t want to miss.

**_Under New Management: How Leading Organizations Are Upending Business as Usual_** by David Burkus

We’re big fans of David Burkus here at Actionable. In [_The Myths of Creativity_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-myths-of-creativity/) he convinced us that creativity isn’t exclusive to a select few, that innovation and great ideas are inherent in all of us, and gave us the tools to harness them. In _Under New Management_ he looks at how leading organizations are disrupting business as we know it. Thank goodness. It was getting kind of stale.
