A little over four years ago, I took an a project that changed my life. The goal was simple:

1.  Read 52 business or personal development books in 52 weeks.
2.  Apply a single idea from each book to my life.
3.  Effectively reinvent the way I interact with the world through 52 behavior or attitude changes.

Actionable Books, [Actionable Workshops](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops), The Salaried Entrepreneur and everything else that now consumes my life professionally is a derivative of that special project. My life is well and truly changed thanks to that year long objective.

To be clear, we’re still a long way off from realizing my dream of what Actionable can become. But, in the spirit of that initial 52 week commitment, we’re making incremental progress – one foot in front of the other as we move steadily towards becoming **the** leadership development centre for time-starved 21st century managers.

I want to thank you for joining us on this journey; I’m constantly amazed by the caliber of people that I have the pleasure of interacting with every day.

I also want to challenge you to think **small**. I think it’s easy for us dreamers to think big – to mentally jump right to the end of the journey. It’s been said a hundred different ways, but I firmly believe that success is the result of 100 little things, not one big sweeping action. Focus on the next step, and enjoy the process. That’s what I’ll be working on, at least.
