Last week I wrote about the risk of being totally tapped out (timewise), and a couple strategies I’ve visited lately around getting back into a place of balance between efficiency and creativity. The point about striving for “70% capacity” seemed to resonate.

The interesting part about being 70% booked is in the actual breakdown of that. Lets assume that I have 3 priorities this month, and that I work 200 hours this month. Those priorities, in my experience, typically require 1-2 days of dedicated work. In other words, if I had everything I needed at my fingertips, I could complete each priority in an average of 12 hours per. (Still with me?)

Of course, I **don’t** have everything I need at my fingertips (team members need to weigh in on things, I’ll have to wait while others complete their components. So it’s not practical to try to block 2 straight days to work on a single task. (It’s also challenging to block 2 days x 3 projects each month as well, of course). But the math works.

3 priorities x 12 hours (average) each = 36 hours. 36 hours / 200 hours = 18% of my time. Let’s get crazy and bump that to **30%.** Ample time allocation to the priority projects… and still only at 30% capacity. That still gives us a lot of buffer to take on the additional “it’s in the job description” tasks that are expected of us, **and** leave some gaps in the calendar for creative flexibility, as well.

Bottom line? My ideal split is:

*   30% for priority projects
*   40% for work that needs to get done
*   30% for open creativity and spontaneous work (or life) projects.

Hit that and I believe you’ll be humming. But I’d love to hear your thoughts.
