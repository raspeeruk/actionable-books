In reading [John Blick’s excellent summary](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/a-special-calling/) from last week, as well as a refresher on [Tribes](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/tribes/), I reconnected with the concept of **criticism as a good thing**.

What happens when I say the words, “Charlie Sheen”? Chances are, you either just said “Winning!” to yourself, or are shaking your head at how the world’s falling apart. Very few people _don’t_ have an opinion on Sheen’s antics of late. Sheen’s polarizing.

I’m not condoning (nor condemning) his actions, simply stating a point – polarization gets attention.

**Now**, if you can polarize a cause you believe in, then you start to build a tribe. And in the teenage years of the internet, a tribe is one of the most precious assets you can have.
