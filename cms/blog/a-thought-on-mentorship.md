In the mid 1990’s, when computers were becoming well and truly entrenched in the way we did business, Jack Welch – then CEO of General Electric – decided he, and his executive team needed mentors. Jack pulled a dozen twenty year-olds out of various entry level positions in the company and brought them to the C-suite, so they could “mentor” the exec’s on how to navigate this new-fangled technology.

Jack didn’t look for title, resume or references in who he wanted as a “mentor”, and he didn’t let his ego get in the way.

Mentoring relationships can cut through age, title, celebrity and rank, if you let it.

What could you be teaching right now? What could you be learning?
