**Case One:**

I took part in my very first “Tweetup” the other day. (For those not in the know, a **tweetup** is an conversation on twitter with a group of people around a specific topic). The guest of honor in this conversation was Scott Stratten, author of [_Unmarketing_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/unmarketing/)_._ Here’s a well known and respected author, spending an hour answering the questions of the masses.

**Case Two:**

I’ve now conducted 30 in person interviews with some of the most celebrated business book authors of our time. Ok, sure, after the first few, it was a little easier to get time with these people, but the first couple? ActionableBooks.com was cruising around 150 unique visitors a month – a nothing. And yet Seth Godin and Gary Vaynerchuk were good enough to take time out of their (very) busy schedules to have an on camera chat.

So here’s my question – if **these guys** are making themselves available to the public, what are you doing? Can your clients contact you? Your fans? How “accessible” are you?
