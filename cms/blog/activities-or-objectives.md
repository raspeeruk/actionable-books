[Earlier this week](https://www.actionablebooks.com/inputs-and-outputs/) I wrote about the importance of thinking about **outputs** when allocating your **inputs**. I want to follow that thread a little longer here, looking at specifically from the perspective of a **team leader.**

As leaders of other people, I believe there is an onus on us to be thinking about the big picture at all times. We need to know what everyone’s working towards, and ensuring that it’s a best use of resources. This isn’t new. This was a requirement 80 years ago and it’s just as relevant now. The difference today, I believe is in sharing what that big picture is, and collaborating on how an employee is workings to make it a reality. One way to do this is to shift our focus – in the conversations we’re having with our team members – shifting the focus from **activities** to **objectives**.

The questions we should be asking of our team members are less **what** questions, and more **why** questions. If we’ve shared the vision effectively, we need to trust that our people are working towards it, to the best of their ability. Our role, as leaders, is to help them think more deeply about why they’re engaged in the tasks that occupy their schedule. Collectively, we can chart the most effective course, try new things and learn from mistakes.

In asking **why** we inspire. In asking **what** we (micro)manage.
