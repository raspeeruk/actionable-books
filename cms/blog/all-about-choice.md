She has devoted much of her professional life to the subject, culminating with the publication of last year’s _The Art of Choosing_. She explores the topic even further with Chris in this 27 minute interview, and even discusses what she wishes she had included in the book. Choice. Turns out, it’s not as simple as deciding between the green apple and the red apple on the cover of Iyengar’s book!
