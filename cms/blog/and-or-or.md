What’s your standard response to “competitive products”? Do you slide into a binary “us or them” mentality? “Let’s figure out how to kill them and wipe them out!” ? Healthy competitive spirit is good, but I think sometimes it can be blinding to other opportunities.

Is there any way that your offerings could **_complement_** a competitive product? What if you sold that angle, rather than insisting on total dominance?

In a marketplace saturated by 37 shades of everything, you may stand out best by being the “and” instead of yet another “or”.
