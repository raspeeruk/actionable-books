I’m heading to [Australia in August](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants) — first time, and I’m really looking forward to it. Someone close to me recently asked how I decided it was the right time to expand the business to a new continent. I went on at length (as I’m prone to doing) about the uptick in web traffic from down under, the partnerships that we’ve developed, etc., etc., yada yada. And it’s all true. But if I’m honest with myself, it’s really about gut.

Something inside me was pulling me to Spain. My wife and I moved here, on a total leap of faith, and the business doubled in 9 months. Have there been setbacks? Certainly. it’s been stressful at times, and there were points where it certainly would have been easier had I stayed in Toronto. But it wouldn’t have been **better**. Long term, for the business and for my own happiness, it’s important to me that I push the envelope. That I “enter the danger” and continue to live outside my comfort zone.

Seth talked about it in [_The Icarus Deception_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-icarus-deception/) – Gone are the days when the **comfort zone** and the **safety zone** overlapped. These days, if you’re not constantly stepping into the uncomfortable — the unfamiliar — you’re falling behind. Taking Actionable to Australia is a step outside the comfort zone. And it’s bloody exciting.

_Our expansion into Australia is for business coaches, consultants and facilitators who are also ready for something fresh. If you know someone like that,_ [_send ’em here_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants)_. I’d love to speak with them._
