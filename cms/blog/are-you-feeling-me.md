Quick question about social media:

When you use it, are you communicating? or are you **connecting?**

Communication is about facts. Data, insight. Sharing links, sending that funny video viral. Connecting is in the moment, and fairly quickly forgotten under the barrage of more.

**Connecting** is about making someone feel heard. Understood, appreciated. Sharing links, and then **discussing**. Slowing down long enough to get to know someone. Connecting is about conversations.

I guess the question is, is social media the ideal tool for connecting? We know it’s great for communicating but…

I’d be curious to hear your thoughts.
