Not everyone knows this, but over half a decade ago, I spent the better part of three years travelling North America interviewing thought leaders and best-selling authors. Andy asked me to highlight some of them for our weekly digest. I’m so glad he did.

As much as I enjoy the flexibility that [podcasting](https://www.actionablebooks.com/podcast) from my office affords me, I have a pang of nostalgia looking back through the 30-odd video interviews that I conducted from 2010-2012. Lugging my television grade video camera around and meeting authors in their homes or offices was an experience I’m not soon to forget. There’s something about that face to face interaction – the idle chit chat during set up and takedown of the equipment and the impact of looking someone in the eyes without a screen between you – that leads to longer term, richer relationships.

Someone once asked me how much I’d spent on plane tickets, hotels and equipment for that two-year saga, and if it had been “worth it”.

“Did I make back the money I spent on it,” in other words? “Was there an ROI?”

It’s hard to say for sure, as there was no direct income from it, though the network established has been invaluable. I actually try not to spend too much time working out the financial benefits of the endeavor though, as I think it’s a dangerous (and wrong) question to be asking… some things are just worth doing, you know? If it’s right and good and fun, the benefits will be there. As Gary Vaynerchuk would say, “_What’s the ROI of your mother?_”

If you’re interested in going deeper into the series, there are interviews with Seth Godin, Dan Pink, Nilofer Merchant, Mitch Joel and many more [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/categories/business-book-author-interviews/page/9/) (_I linked back to the oldest ones, first – you can tab forward in time via the numbers at the bottom of the page_).

For those who want a curated sampling\*, here are some of the highlights, in no particular order:

[**Sir Ken Robinson**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/sir-ken-robinson-intelligence-and-engagement/)Recorded in Los Angeles, California.

[**Gary Vaynerchuk**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/gary-vaynerchuk-less-talking-more-doing/)Recorded in New York, NY.

[**Chip Conley**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/reaching-the-peak/)Recorded in International Waters. (Yes, seriously.)

[**Sally Hogshead**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/vol-8-with-sally-hogshead-witchcraft-and-marketing/)Recorded in Calgary, Alberta.

[**Dan Heath**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/vol-10-with-dan-heath-making-change-stick/)Recorded in Chicago, Illinois.

\*And by sampling, I mean checking out different logos, intros, hairstyles and camera styles, **as well as** some fabulous content. What can I say? It was early days. We were experimenting.  Enjoy!
