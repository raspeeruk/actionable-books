I had the pleasure of attending an industry summit last week, as a speaker and as a supplier member. I’ve been a member of the association for 3 years now, and I know most of the 100(ish) members fairly well. They smile, they say hi, they ask how my business is doing. It’s nice. But, aside from a small handful of clients, I’ve yet to really “break in” to this particular industry.

As part of the conference planning committee, I organized a “Supplier Member Dinner”, where the setting was such that the active members (aka, potential clients) were “encouraged” to sit and eat parts of their meal with different supplier members (aka vendors) over the course of the evening. And something remarkable happened.

The active members were suddenly buzzing about the offerings of the supplier members. There were dozens of card exchanges, enthusiastic “please call me”s, and a whole new level of conversation taking place, all over the room. And I believe that is due, in large part, to the fact that there was a great deal of **_surprise_** around the room. Active members were taking suppliers out of the boxes they had previously put them in, and suddenly realizing a whole new world of possibility. They were engaged in conversation – the exchange of ideas and experiences – while breaking bread together. They were connecting.

It’s such a simple thing, but sometimes it takes a “time out” with someone in order for you to see them in a new light. (and them you)

Look for unique ways to connect with people – even people that (you think) you know.
