I’m looking into getting some new glasses. The Optometrist asked if I had hyperopic (farsightedness) or myopic (nearsighted) vision.

When you put on your “business glasses”, which one do you suffer from? Are you living way in the distance, and missing the details? Or are you so focused on the details you’ve forgot about what you’re really working towards?

It’s worth taking some time out every now and then to make sure you’re visiting both. And, if you’re not, it may be time to get some help.
