We hope you find a lot of value out of the book summaries that we post almost every week day! What you may not know is that they’re written by a dedicated team of volunteers who have not only a passion for books, but also knowledge and learning, and who like to pass on the Insights they glean so others can benefit, too. I want to take a moment to celebrate some recent milestones in our Actionable Book Club community.
