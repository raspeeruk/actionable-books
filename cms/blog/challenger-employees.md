Just finished reading Jill Donahue’s **brilliant** summary of _The Challenger Sale_. ([Summary here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-challenger-sale/)) Turns out that the best sales reps out there are challenging their customers to think differently. Here’s the full description of a “Challenger” sales rep:

*   Offer the customer unique perspectives
*   Have strong two-way communication skills
*   Know the individual customer’s value drivers
*   Can identify economic drivers of the customer’s business
*   Are comfortable discussing money
*   Can pressure the customer

So here’s my question for you – if you’re a business leader (not just a sales leader, but any leader), **wouldn’t you want these same attributes in the people on your team?** Look at the list again. Everything on here says “engaged” to me.

*   “Offering unique perspectives” means **_thinking_** about the business and being curious.
*   “Strong two-way communication” means **_listening_** as well as speaking; being collaborative.
*   “Knowing value drivers” means having a clear sense of the **_team goal(s)_** and culture.
*   “Identify economic drivers” means tying projects to company bottom line.
*   “comfortable discussing money” means more honest and real conversations.
*   “can pressure the customer” means a higher level of trust and conviction.

These sound like the indicators of an engaged, impassioned employee working towards a clearly defined goal. We’ve been saying for years that [these things are important](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops)… now we’re seeing the financial impact of them. Very cool.
