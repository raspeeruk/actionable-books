With April upon us, we can officially close the book on Q1 of 2015. Good, bad or ugly, it’s done. Gone. A thing of the past. Take 30 minutes this week to reflect on the past three months, and to determine what you’re going to do differently in Q2. Here are a few questions to get you started…

**Reflecting on Q1:**

*   What do you know now that you didn’t know January 1st?
*   **Who** do you know now that you didn’t know January 1st?
*   What did you try?
*   What did you finish?
*   What did you say yes to?
*   What did you say no to?
*   What did you read?
*   Who did you learn from?
*   What were your targets? How did you do? Why?

**Planning for Q2:**

*   What are you going to do more of? What behaviors need to change to do that?
*   What are you to do less of? What behaviors need to change to do **that**?
*   What are your three “big rocks”?
*   What are your targets? Should they be adjusted, based on Q1 results?

Here we go. Let’s make the next 3 months count.

**_Also,_** _applications for this year’s final North American ACP cohort ends next week. If you’re a consultant looking to grow your business this year,_ [_this might be worth checking out_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants)_._
