Now officially arrived in Spain, I find myself with a unique opportunity.

With a six hour time difference between me and most of my professional world, I have the freedom of **no responsibility to other people before 2pm** **local time** (8am EDT). Which means I have opportunity to design those hours exactly as I see fit. Or, more specifically, to my personal values.

How often are we presented with an opportunity to start our day with a clean slate? To rethink all habits, routines and accepted behaviours?

The irony here is that nothing’s changing on the professional front. I have the same responsibilities and opportunities as I had before, yet the dramatic move to a new continent is **forcing** me to think about this. I could have done it years ago.

“Time management” is a term that gets thrown around a lot, usually referring to efficiency. My suggestion is that true time management is about building your day according to exactly what’s important to you. And, if you’re stronger than me, you can do so without changing your time zone.

If you’re interested in hearing more about my thoughts on time management, I’m hosting a webinar on Monday, Sept 30th at 4pm EST. **You can** [**register**](https://actionable.webex.com/actionable/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=669283611) **in advance, as we’re keeping it small.**
