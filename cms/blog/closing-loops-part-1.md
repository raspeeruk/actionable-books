One of the fastest and easiest ways to reduce anxiety and overwhelm in your life is to **close loops**. What do we mean? Take a task to completion before you move to the next. David Allen talked about this, way back when. We can increase our energy levels, reduce our stress levels and increase confidence simply by completing a project or task.

In a different arena, financial guru, Dave Ramsey talk about paying off your lowest balance credit card as a powerful way to regain your sense of financial control. A rational pragmatist might suggest that paying off the highest interest rate first makes the most sense. And of course it does. But we know that emotion drives behaviour with greater impact (and on longer term) than logic and ration does.

So close loops. Complete smaller tasks to reduce stress and get happier.
