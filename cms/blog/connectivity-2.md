It continues to amaze me what an exceptionally high caliber of individuals we have in the Actionable Books community (_yes, that would be you_). **Managers who genuinely care** about their people and want to see a change to the corporate status quo. **Established entrepreneurs who remain curious**, humble and innovative despite their success. **Coaches and consultants** who have made leadership development their life’s work. **Authors who light the way to a better future**. We truly are surrounded by some wonderful people.

With that community in mind, we set out this year with the singular focus of **connectivity;** finding ways and creating tools to help the busy members of our community connect with one another in a meaningful and productive way. As of today, February 19th, I’m delighted to announce that the first phase of that connectivity plan goes live, with the following features in place:

[**#BizBkChat**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/bizbkchat//): Building on her amazing success of #HRBookChat, we’re excited to be working with Alyssa Burkus to bring you live, monthly Twitter chats with top business book authors. The first chat is next Monday, Feb 25th with the authors of **Why Managing Sucks.** (_I’m personally really looking forward to this one!_) Sign up for reminders so you don’t miss out on future sessions.

**Webinar Series:** For the last three and a half years, I (Chris) have been traveling around North America, interviewing the world’s best business book authors. The insights gleaned from those candid conversations have been tremendous, and I’m delighted to share them with you in our new **Monthly Webinar** segment. Space is limited for these, so you’ll want to make sure you [register in advance](http://actionablebooks.enterthemeeting.com/m/ORR6CF7M). (February 21st’s topic is [**_21st Century_ _Leadership_**](http://actionablebooks.enterthemeeting.com/m/ORR6CF7M)**.**)

**Social Media Conversations:** Since everyone has a different desired level of involvement with Actionable Books, and different preferred methods of interaction, we’ve divided our three social media channels into different types of conversations:

Our [**Twitter**](http://www.twitter.com/actionablebooks) channel remains our main forum for updates on new content, upcoming events and providing you with connection points to the authors. Our summaries are also now integrated with “Click to Tweet” functionality, so you can quickly and easily share your favorite quotes from the books we’re discussing.

The [**Facebook**](http://www.facebook.com/actionablebooks) group provides your daily dose of inspiration with quotes from the books, conversations around hot new titles and plenty of visuals.

Our new [**LinkedIn**](http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Actionable-Books-4794843) group is for the deeper, richer conversations; how are you applying the ideas from the books you’ve read (on Actionable or otherwise) and what’s resonating? This is also a great forum for you to connect with other professionals on meatier topics, and ask for advice and input on which books could best address a specific challenge you’re faced with.

All these features and more will be showcased in a new section of the site – [**The Community**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/community) – which will act as a central hub on all things Actionable. “The Community” will be going live later this week and we do hope you’ll stop by regularly for your high level snapshot of everything that’s going on. In the meantime, these new pieces mark the beginning of a new type of engagement with Actionable Books – one where you have the ability to play an active role, rather than just passively consuming the summaries. We’ve marked this next chapter with an update to the aesthetic of the site, one which we hope you’ll enjoy.

We, of course, hope that you’ll continue to enjoy the summaries, but I also hope that you’ll consider stepping up and playing more of a vocal role in this community. Jump on the Twitter chats and engage the authors. Sign on to your social media channel of choice and reach out to some of your fellow members. Make this site yours and truly grow from your time with us.

This is just the beginning for our “year of connectivity”, but I’m excited about the progress made to date. As always, please let me know if you have any ideas, feedback or suggestions on how we can make the site better.

To your continued success,
