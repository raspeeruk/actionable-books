Hot off the heels from our annual Leadership Retreat and one thing has become abundantly apparent – **values drive team relationships**.

This isn’t new. I’ve even blogged about it [recently](https://www.actionablebooks.com/do-you-like-your-team/). What was new (for me) was (1) the importance of simplicity in identifying those values and (2) in clarifying those values as a team.

Long story short, here’s what we finalized (as a group) as the core values for the Actionable Books team:

**1\. Create Something Exceptional.**

**2\. Be Real.**

**3\. Have Fun.**

And that’s it. The great thing is that even for me – man of the goldfish memory (“Hey look, a castle!”) – these are memorable. These are anchored in real stories, and can be benchmarked against. (Are we being real? Are we having fun doing it?).

I think there can be a lot of pressure to make company values larger than life, or full of business jargon. For us, simplicity is a powerful path. The retreat ended only a few hours ago, and I’m already hearing people talk about how to make the next sales meeting exceptional. How to product a weekly digest that embodies the sense of realism and fun that we aspire to. And that feels pretty good.

_Good looking group, eh?_
