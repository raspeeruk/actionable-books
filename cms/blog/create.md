After a long hiatus from anything that could be deemed “creative”, I’ve spent the last few days making videos, finalizing podcast episodes and writing. And I’ve never felt better.

It’s amazing how the work that can give us the most joy is also the work we so often find excuses not to do. Busy work is fine, and has its place, but the true engagement comes when we step out onto the ledge of creating value. Of putting something new into the world. Of saying, “Yes, it was scary. But I did this.”

**Create.** What are you waiting for?
