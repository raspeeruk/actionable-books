We’re going through a fairly aggressive growth phase at Actionable, including the recent hire of two new team members. Hiring for a virtually based company has its own set of considerations, including how well the individuals can work in isolation, how strong their communication skills are, and whether they’re naturally inclined to take ownership over their role.

In addition to all that, though, there’s the very real matter of “Culture Fit,” in all new hires, for companies large and small. As we went about the process of identifying and hiring these new team members, I started thinking about what “Culture Fit” really means. It’s a term that gets thrown around a lot, but aside from a “gut instinct,” how do we really determine whether someone fits with the team culture?

**As I see it, there are actually three components to culture fit**:

**1\. Role fit.** Is the new individual right for the specific position you’re looking to fill? Do they not only have the skill set to do the job effectively, but do they _enjoy_ the tasks associated? If you’re looking to add someone to your team who’s going to think beyond the job description – providing real value to the role – they need to be someone who lives in that space and is naturally inclined to bring new ideas to the table as a result of their knowledge and ongoing experience.

**2\. Team Dynamic fit.** Your team has a certain energy; a certain vibe. They work at a certain speed, communicate in a certain way, and work in an environment that feels inclusive. They feel like they belong. They might even be friends. This can be a great environment to create and foster, but I would caution against assuming that Team Dynamic = Culture. Instead, I’d say it’s more appropriate to identify team dynamic as part of the “right now” culture.

**3\. Ideology fit.** Here’s where I think people can go wrong. They hire for Team Dynamic fit, wanting everyone to get along. The team ends up looking the same, dressing the same, sharing the same sense of humour, etc. Again, nothing wrong with that, so long as they **also share a unified agreement and belief in the company ideology.** Do your new hires understand the change your team is looking to make in the world? Do they believe in the value of what you do? Are they committed to being a part of that change?

My grandparents – married 67 years, if you can believe it – may be a great example of a successful Ideology fit. Certainly, they had the Team Dynamic fit 50 years ago – enjoying the same music, the same friends, the same lifestyle. But people change, as do companies. 67 years of marriage can only exist when you share an ideology of what life should be.

The makeup of your team can (and should) shift as you grow. Hiring for Team Dynamic fit **alone** can water down your team purpose and, in some cases, can actually stagnate the growth of your company. Being homogeneous is not always a positive thing. Fresh ideas come from people with a shared ideology, but a different outlook on life.

Having fun with your team is great. Just don’t forget about the big picture, and stay focused on the long term.
