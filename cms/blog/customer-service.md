Like an idiot, I forgot to turn off my roaming on my iPhone when I was down in the US. Total damage? **$587.** Brutal, but totally my fault. Taking a chance, I called Rogers. I was through to a human being in less than 5 minutes – a wonderful human being in fact, named Nicole. Nicole was not only sympathetic, she spent 15 minutes with me on the phone working through a couple options. End of the day, she was able to knock $232.75 off my bill. Still a lot, but believe me, I left the call smiling.

And you know what? Even if she hadn’t been able to help me, her attitude was enough that I was glad I’d called. Never underestimate your front line – the people who speak with your customers truly do have the ability to make or break you.

Oh. And turn your phone off when you cross the border.
