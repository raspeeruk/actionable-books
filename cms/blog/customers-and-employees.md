I was rewatching [my interview with Simon Sinek](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-5-with-simon-sinek-starting-with-why/) today (it was for a related project – no, I don’t sit at home watching videos of myself by default) and I was struck by a particular line he shared:

**“There is no difference between a customer and an employee.”**

Customers buy from you because they believe in your mission, employees want to work for you because they believe in your mission. The actions are different, but the motivations are the same. People are attracted to purpose. To authenticity. To clarity.

If you’re not getting your ideal clients or employees coming through your doors, maybe you’re just not being clear enough on who you are and what you stand for. And, in this over saturated world of abundance we live in, if you’re not being exceptionally clear on who you are and what you stand for, people will never find hear you over the noise.
