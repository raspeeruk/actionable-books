The more clearly defined you want something to be, the more sacrifices you’ll be required to make.

Let’s look at it in regards to the human body. The more defined you want your muscles to be, the more selective you need to be with what you eat/drink/do. Most of us don’t need to be too picky. But body builders do. It’s their job to be selective. They understand the sacrifices that greatness demands.

**Do you?**

What kind of a manager do you want to be? What kind of an entrepreneur? What kind of parent? What type of sacrifices might you need to make to be that person?
