In the context of learning:

*   How much time do you spend reading?
*   How much time do you spend listening or watching?
*   How much time do you spend **conversing**?

Not conversing to state or defend your point. Not conversing for the transactional transfer of urgent (but unimportant) data, but for the true and pure purpose of learning.

When I reflect back over the years of [Actionable Interviews](www.actionablebooks.com/interviews), I can safely say that some of my biggest and most memorable learning experiences came through the opportunity to ask my own, real-time questions of the authors… and then discuss it with them at length.

**This Friday**, I’d love it if you could join the conversation as well. I’ll be reconnecting with Lewis Schiff – author of _Business Brilliant_ – and we’ll be discussing the role that failure plays in success. He’s a smart guy. I’m looking forward to the conversation and you can too – for the first time ever, you’ll have the opportunity to participate live and ask your questions via a real time chat feed. [**Register today**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/fail-like-a-millionaire-opt-in/), if you’re interested (The event is free, but there are limited spots available)

Learning through discussion is one of the most powerful vehicles I know and, I believe, one of the more underrated. Pick someone’s brain today ~ get a conversation going for the sole purpose of learning.
