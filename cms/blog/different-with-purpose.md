Seth Godin’s latest – [Poke the Box](http://www.amazon.com/Poke-Box-Seth-Godin/dp/1936719002/) – hits the streets today. More than just the fact this is a Godin book, _Poke the Box_ is special, as it marks the inaugural publication from “The Domino Project” – a collaborative experiment in the book publishing world; championed by Seth and backed by Amazon.

Check out this [insightful post](http://www.thedominoproject.com/2011/02/why-arent-there-words-on-the-cover-of-our-books.html) into how Domino is shaking things up in the printed book world and, while you do, keep one word in mind – **purpose**. They’re not making changes simply to be different. They’re being different with cause. Seth knows the publishing world inside out, which is what allows him to break the rules in educated, purposeful ways. It’s the Michelin chef who opens a burger joint. Or the Jazz legend who grew up playing classical.

Learn the rules.

Question Everything.

Look for greatness where others have settled.

Be different with purpose.

Because that’s the type of different that sticks.
