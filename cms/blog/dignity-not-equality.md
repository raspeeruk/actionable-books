This week’s newsletter discusses two special books – [_The Mary Kay Way_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-mary-kay-way/), an autobiography on the life of Mary Kay founder, Mark Kay Ash, and [_A Special Calling_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/a-special-calling/), the autobiography of Dr. Gordon Bell, a pioneer in the field of alcoholism treatment. Both individuals were highly successful in their own fields. The biggest theme through both books though, is the innovators’ whole hearted belief in the Golden Rule; do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And that’s it. That was the “secret to success” for both these celebrated people.

Gary Vaynerchuk has a new book out – [_The Thank You Economy_](http://thankyoueconomybook.com/)_._ In it, Gary talks about the importance of treating your customers and followers with respect. At the end of the day, that’s all we’re talking about. We’re talking about respect. About human connection. About not “counting” your fans, but connecting with them.

Simple message, yet so profound – treat people with dignity, respect and love. It’s not a new one (in fact, it’s one of the oldest). And yet it keeps popping up. Which is to say, we still need to hear it.

Here’s a couple other great books that hit on the notion of the Golden Rule as it applies to business:

[_I Love You More than My Dog_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/i-love-you-more-than-my-dog/)

[_Greater Than Yourself_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/greater-than-yourself/)
