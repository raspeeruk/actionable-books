As Actionable Books continues to grow, I find myself in need of more and more “professional services”. Whether it’s “upgrading” my accountant, lawyer or video producers, I find that there’s a higher level of expectations on what we produce and we (of course) want to stay ahead of those expectations. Last week it was a new CRM (Client Relationship Manager) that I wanted to look into. [Salesforce.com](http://salesforce.com) is the the king of the CRM world… which doesn’t always mean they’re the best.

But in this case, it does. Within an hour of signing up for the free trial I had an email from Mohammed. I connected for a call with Mohammed (very cool dude) later that same day, who asked probing questions about my business, and then connected me with Nick – a **local** who understood Software as a Service (SaaS) business models and could further help me address my needs. I connected with Nick today for 25 minutes and had a fantastic conversation. Not only did he help me feel comfortable with my decision to go with Salesforce as my CRM solution, he spoke to me _as a human being;_ making the occasional joke, asking (with genuine interest) about my business and allowing me to participate in the creation of a plan that makes sense for all things Actionable. There’s a reason Salesforce is number one.

Now, here’s the most interesting part – I’ve spent 20 minutes using the Salesforce tools and I can’t figure it out yet. Rather than getting frustrated and moving to another alternative (keep in mind they haven’t taken a dime yet), I’m confident that the robust capabilities of the tool, along with the fantastic level of support I’ve received to date, will **far** outweigh any learning curves with understanding how to use the product.

There’s a bunch of lessons we can all take from Salesforce. Keep it up, guys.
