Google Maps is a fantastic tool; get from A to B in as little time as possible, with step by step directions. Not bad for a free service. What some people don’t know though is that while Maps will **default** to the shortest route, that route is completely customizable by “dragging the line”. Suddenly, the route choices are endless.

I found myself in exactly such a situation when a meeting in Seattle cancelled and I was suddenly presented with 24 hours within which to drive the 4 hours to Corvallis, Oregon. It took me 8 hours to make that drive when I chose to take the coastal 101 route instead of the more direct I5. **The weather was perfect, the sound system was optimized and I lost myself in that drive.** _It was exactly what I needed._

Here’s the point – **efficiency is great, when efficiency is the goal.** Let’s not assume that this is always the case. Like Google Maps, we can “default” to efficiency, but please don’t forget that whatever path you take is **a choice**. If you’re unhappy with the route you’re on – whether it’s turning out different than expected, or priorities have simply changed – don’t be afraid to drag the line.

_On a tangental point, the best consultants and coaches I know are exceptionally good at dragging the line. They keep an open mind to all the routes available, and help clients articulate the purpose of the route before helping them down it. I’ll be sharing other insights I’ve picked up from top coaches and consultants over the years on_ **_May 22nd_** _via a free_ [_webinar_](https://actionable.webex.com/actionable/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=666450621)_. If you’re a consultant, I hope you’ll_ [_join me_](https://actionable.webex.com/actionable/onstage/g.php?t=a&d=666450621)_._
