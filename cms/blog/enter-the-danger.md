In recent interviews with [Patrick Lencioni](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/patrick-lencioni-the-value-of-vulnerability/) and [Cameron Herold](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/cameron-herold-its-only-26-x-3/), both gentlemen insisted on the importance of “entering the danger”; identifying the potentially awkward situations, and getting a conversation started. Immediately.

“Entering the danger”, for me, is about more than conversations. It’s about shining a light on any dark corners of your mind. Any place where doubt, uncertainty, or misconception could hide and flourish. “Entering the danger” is about saying, “Ok, it seems as though my mind may be running away with itself on **this issue**. Let’s put it under the microscope.”

Questions to consider, when Entering the Danger:

*   What are the facts?
*   What are my feelings?
*   Are those feelings grounded in **relevant** facts?
*   What’s the best action I could take at this point?
*   Is there anyone else I need to include in this?
*   **What do I want to have happen?** (That one, c[omplements of Seth](http://actionablebooks.com/asking-the-right-question/))

Anything that fills you with a little fear or uncertainty is worthy of some scrutiny. It takes a certain professional maturity to address these issues with a balance of humility and confidence.
