When you embark on (or join) a new endeavour, everything is fresh. Everything is new and exciting. Over time, as you become more familiar with the project nuances and start to develop a track record or set of expectations, you run the risk of moving from a mindset of excitement to one of entitledness. I encourage you to resist that progression.

When you start to expect certain things – certain outcomes, responses or levels of responsiveness – you set yourself up for disappointment. In this entitled mindset, you’re effectively trying to gain or maintain control on things that are ultimately outside of your scope of influence. Here’s what I’ve seen from people who become entitled – trying to maintain control over other people’s behaviours or actions.

When you adopt an entitled mindset, you add:

*   anxiety,
*   blame,
*   fear,
*   a lack of trust,
*   and not much else.

Stay curious. Your blood pressure (and colleagues) will thank you.
