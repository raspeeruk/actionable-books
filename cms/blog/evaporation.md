I finished reading [_The Impact of a Single Event_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HBNLFW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B006HBNLFW&linkCode=as2&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkId=RKUOWB63UUQL4LVU) this week. Interesting book (and Canadian!). There’s a minor character in it who argues against the absolute truth of anything. (Great party conversation incidentally, if you’re looking for something a little different). When someone poses the absolute truth of 1 + 1 = 2, the character reminds us that adding two identical glasses of water together does not equal two, absolutely, as a (very) small percentage of said water will evaporate during the process, leaving us with something closer to 1.99999. Which got me thinking about time.

On a monthly basis, I spend a day on strategy and planning for the following 30 days. I map out my priorities – my “quadrant 2”, important-but-not-as-urgent tasks that I want to make sure receive the proper attention in the busyness of the days ahead. But what exactly is “proper attention”?

I’ve learned (as you likely have) that a task that should take 90 minutes can often consume a day. Sometimes there’s the reality that I didn’t fully appreciate how much work was required. Other times I want to perfect it, and that last 5% takes 50% of the time. And then there’s the natural evaporation of time. We take bathroom breaks. We eat. We stretch or go for a quick walk. All good. All required. All leading to the evaporation of time.

In our bootcamp session on Friday we talked about charging the appropriate rate, as a freelancer. And that most people undercharge, particularly at the beginning. They forget about evaporation; about the interruptions, the distractions, the ego and our own fears, all of which sabotage our best intended schedules.

Whether you’re a freelancer or not, I believe one of the reasons we’re all “so busy” is because we assume our work takes place in a vacuum; a time-perfect environment in which a 90-minute task takes 90-minutes. It doesn’t it. It won’t. We don’t.

You can regain some sanity in your life by creating buffers between your tasks. By appreciating that we don’t work in time-vacuums, and that a few top priority tasks done well (with proper time built in for reflection and creativity) will get us a lot further ahead in life than checking boxes and scrambling from one task to the next. It might just help with your blood pressure, too.
