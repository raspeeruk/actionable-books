The days are already starting to get shorter and there’s a crispness in the air. Fall is around the corner and with it a slew of highly anticipated new books. Here are five that we’re looking forward to at Actionable.

1.  **_Rising Strong_** by Brené Brown  
    Brené Brown, the bestselling author of [_Daring Greatly_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/daring-greatly/) and [_The Gifts of Imperfection_](https://d3mkywnuoki91n.cloudfront.net/actionablebooks-com-wp-content/uploads/2013/01/imperfection.jpg) is back. Her subject? Dusting yourself off after failure. It’s a book that _Red Magazine_ has called “A mind-blowing, life-changing read”. You won’t want to miss it.
2.  **_Big Magic: Creative Living Beyond Fear_** by Elizabeth Gilbert  
    In some way or another fear is a part of all of our lives. Elizabeth Gilbert (_Eat Pray Love_) has written this book for anyone who wants to help eliminate fear and live a creative life.
3.  **_Traction: How Any Startup Can Achieve Explosive Customer Growth_** by Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares  
    When _Traction_ was first released last year it was met by unanimous praise from both critics and readers alike. Authors Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares have completely revised and updated their tome, an indispensable resource for anyone running a startup.
4.  **_The Very Little but Very Powerful Book on Closing: Ask the Right Questions, Transfer the Value, Create the Urgency, and Win the Sale_** by Jeffrey Gitomer  
    Our pal Jeffrey Gitomer is back with a tiny book that promises to pack a big punch. _The Very Little but Very Powerful Book on Closing_ is for anyone in sales and even for those who aren’t. Remember, we all sell! (If you’re chomping at the bit for the debut of Jeffrey’s new book in December, be sure to revisit our [interview](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/nothing-new-in-sales-with-jeffrey-gitomer/) from last year.)
5.  **_The Silo Effect: The Peril of Expertise and the Promise of Breaking Down Barriers_** by Gillian Tett  
    In _The Silo Effect_ journalist Gillian Tett has written an “examination of how our tendency to create functional departments—silos—hinders our work…and how some people and organizations can break those silos down to unleash innovation.” It’s already burning up the charts and is sure to inspire great debate.
