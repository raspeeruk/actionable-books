This week’s summary article on [_Focus_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/focus/) got me thinking about my own work practices. In the six hours since I read the article, I’ve been hyper aware of just how many tasks I “work on” at the same time. A long time ago I read [_The Myth of Multitasking_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-myth-of-multitasking/), which tells us that “multitasking” is actually physically impossible for a human being. I know this. And yet I succumb to the urge to have 13 windows open on my desktop regardless.

I think maybe there’s a pride in seeing how many juggling balls I can have in the air at once? Bragging rights perhaps (if only to myself) at how distracted I can be, and still be productive? You may be able to relate.

I’m going to propose a challenge of a different sort. How long can you work on just one thing? How deep into a project can you go without succumbing to the urge to check email?

My fear is that the wider we go – the more balls we keep in the air at the same time – the more shallowly we’re forced to be with the engagement of each. Imagine the tasks are people – How well can you actually get to know someone if you’re talking to 13 people at once? Sometimes there’s a need for breadth – for tackling a dozen things at the same time. Just don’t forget about the other end of the spectrum. Something tells me that’s where true satisfaction lies.
