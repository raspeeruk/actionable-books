Gary Vaynerchuk is a self proclaimed “triple-z” celebrity, though his rabid fans may disagree with the humble status. Gary’s become an icon of the social media world, and a traditional media darling with his authentic energy and no nonsense approach to business and building your personal brand.

“Crushing It” is part 2 of a 12 part author interview series taking place throughout 2010.
