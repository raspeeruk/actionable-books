**Round Two with @GaryVee!**  
(author of [Crush It!](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/) and [The Thank You Economy](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-thank-you-economy/) <– _Links go to our Actionable Summaries)_

This time we’re talking Vodka, Building Platforms, Social Media as a PART of the future, expanding your scope when thinking business, and the extinction of tigers. (seriously)

It’s an interview about growing up (while quoting Jay-Z) and a ton of fun, as always.

Enjoy!
