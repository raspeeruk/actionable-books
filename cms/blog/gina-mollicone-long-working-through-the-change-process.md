In this, our second interview with Gina Mollicone-Long of [The Greatness Group](http://www.greatnessgroup.com/), and author of [Think or Sink](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/think-or-sink/), we’re talking about a hot topic – **the change process**; specifically, how to speed up the timeline on pushing through to the next level of success in your life, business, whatever.

As an added bonus, Chris breaks a board with his bare hand. Yup, it’s pretty awesome.

**Here’s the change process that Gina is referencing during the conversation:**
