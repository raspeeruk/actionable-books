As I was polishing off Roger Martin’s latest, [_Fixing the Game_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/fixing-the-game/) this week, I commented to a peer that Martin’s new book was very “Gladwellian,” meaning that I thought it was well written, told a great story, and bridged the gap between the business and pop culture world.

It’s got to be a testament to your definitive style when people refer to you as an adjective. So here’s a question for you:

Assume your name’s Steve. If someone was going to do something “Steve-ishly,” what would you want that to mean? Are you living that every day?

It’s hard for people to get clarity around who you are if you’re not doing it exceptionally well, repeatedly, and on a big scale. You know; Jobsishly.
