Reading Tim Sander’s latest _Today We Are Rich_ last week, I came across a great term – “grazing”: the superficial act of cruising through websites, Facebook pages, Twitter streams, TV channels and magazines with little to no discernment. No real interaction. Just consuming everything that passes in front of your eyes, almost more as a passive behavior than an active one.

Every great business success story I read about embodies a sense of purpose. Decision. Focus, and attention to detail. Deliberate choice as to what is consumed, when, and with what purpose.

The successful don’t have time for grazing, because they’re too busy making things happen. I haven’t heard any stories yet of anyone who stumbled into a fulfilling, passion-filled life of purpose through watching another episode of _The Bachelor_.
