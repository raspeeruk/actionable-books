Cleaning up the office over the weekend, I came across an old copy of my notes from [_The Long Tail_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-long-tail/)_._ (It’s a great book – you should 100% check it out if you haven’t already.)

One of the ideas I took away from the book is this:

#### “When your content is free, it doesn’t make sense to be boring.”

Now, this is probably true with paid products as well, but I’ve got imagine it’s ever more important when you’re competing for attention. If you’re posting something – be it text, audio, video or photo – have a personality. **Seriously.** Content isn’t enough. Eyeballs go to those who have good content **_presented in a compelling way._** Who are you talking to? Do you know? What’s their sense of humor? Their reading interests? Will they get your Lionel Richie references?

Know your audience. Connect with them as human beings.
