Way back in 2010, when I had **just** started out with my first [video author interview series](https://www.actionablebooks.com/blog/categories/business-book-author-interviews/), I had the pleasure of [meeting Ms. Sally Hogshead](https://www.actionablebooks.com/blog/vol-8-with-sally-hogshead-witchcraft-and-marketing/) – then a first-time-author – at an Art of Leadership event in Calgary, Alberta. We talked about the world of personality styles and personality assessments. We discussed “fascination triggers in action”, and how tapping into what makes you uniquely fascinating can be an empowering act.

Sally’s a character, and I’m delighted that she’s back (in a big way) with a new book, _How the World Sees You_. I had the chance to connect with Sally this week to discuss the new book, and the research that went into it’s creation. _(The audio recording is below)_

Also, you may have seen [the post last week](https://www.actionablebooks.com/blog/whats-your-anthem/) where Sally provided the Actionable Community with 500 free Fascination Advantage Assessments? Well, she just gave us some more (_lots more_) which means, if you haven’t done so already, you can share the assessment with your friends, family and community as well, should you see fit. Go for it! _(seriously. lots.)_
