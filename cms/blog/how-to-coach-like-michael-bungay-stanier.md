We’ve been excited for the world to finally get a chance to read Michael Bungay Stanier’s [_The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-coaching-habit/) since we were given a peek late last year. Now that time has come. This book is an indispensable resource if you’re a leader or aspire to someday be one.

On March 11, 2016, Michael will be joining us for an exclusive free webinar and _you’re_ invited. Over the course of the hour he will unpack some of the most important takeaways from his book, including:

1.  Why coaching is a **critical skill** for organizations and how you can make a significant impact on overall performance in your organization.
2.  The **7 questions** you should ask your team members to empower them to own (and solve!) their problems.
3.  How to master the art of answering questions by **asking more questions**, rather than jumping in with solutions, leaving ownership for solving the problem with the person who needs to implement the solution. (BONUS: this frees the person being asked for help from feeling they need to “rescue” the other person.)
4.  How to fully embrace a **coaching mindset** and how to avoid the barriers or pitfalls that could prevent you from initiating a successful coaching conversation.
5.  How to form habits using Michael’s **New Habit Formula** from the book.
6.  How to build coaching skills at all levels and increase the use of coaching in peer-to-peer relationships using our newest module in the Actionable platform, the **Coaching Mindset**, based on Michael’s newest book.

So, what are you waiting for?
