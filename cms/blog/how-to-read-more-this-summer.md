Are you falling short of your goal of making reading part of your regular routine?

With so many other things taking precedence in our lives, it’s not hard for reading to get short shrift. However, we’ve got just the antidote to that is guaranteed to help you to be more deliberate about your reading this summer and beyond.

It’s called the Actionable Book Club. Now in its fourth year, I’ve been proudly running it alongside my colleagues Peter Nakamura and Megan Thomas since 2013.

If you haven’t heard of it, let me get you up to speed. The ABC attracts a wide array of people from different walks out life–young professionals, stay at home parents, entrepreneurs, etc. The common denominator is that our members are all committed to making reading and learning a priority in their lives. Once a month, for six months, they read a book of their choosing on a subject that interests them, and produce a [summary](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/) based on the takeaway that resonated most strongly with them. We call this the The Big Idea. The writer then offers two ways for the reader to implement this takeaway into their lives (the Insights). The result is a deeper understanding of the material, which lasts long after you’ve read the last page of the book. Once a month we gather online for a mastermind-like call to discuss what we learned and how we’ve applied these lessons to make a difference in our personal and professional lives.

If you want to make reading a priority in the second half of 2016, please consider joining us in the Actionable Book Club. Applications close **Saturday, May 21, 2016** at Midnight EST. Click [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/bookclub/) to learn more.
