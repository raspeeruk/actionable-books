For some, millennial is a dirty word.

Millennials are seen by many as too demanding and needy. Sure, that can sometimes be true, but millennials also know how to stay ahead of the competition and make speed a competitive advantage, both of which are requisite in the 21st century workplace.

On Tuesday, February 16th at 12pm EST Jamie Notter and Maddie Grant, authors of _When Millennials Take Over_ are joining Actionable’s Alyssa Burkus for a one hour, free live webinar called [**Influencing Pace**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/influencing-pace/), which promises to equip you with the tools to help you think like a millennial. Notter and Grant “are the founding partners of Culture That Works and strategists who are known for helping organizations create remarkable cultures, attract the best employees and most loyal customers, and thrive in the digital age.”

Over the course of the hour you will learn:

1.  How embracing your **inner-millennial** will help you:
2.  feel more comfortable with a high volume of information
3.  make decisions quickly

5.  increase your pace

7.  **stay ahead of the competition**

10.  Why integrating these **4 key capabilities** — **Digital, Clear, Fluid, Fast** — into your organization will help you:
11.  operate efficiently
12.  move faster

14.  perform better, just like millennials

17.  How **processing information effectively** will allow you to use transparency, clarity and speed in your daily communication within your organization.

Our **Influencing Pace** webinar promises to be an invaluable, information packed hour that you won’t want to miss.
