Out for a dinner with a friend tonight, comparing our handmade messenger bags. Talking about the hand written Thank You card I received from my courier company. A recent customer service experience at Bose.

Then I came home to learn of [Steve’s passing](http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/). If there was ever a man to embody the ideology of the new era – that of passion, beauty **and** functionality, customer experience and the power of storytelling – it was Steve Jobs.

Jobs embodied it, but we’re all living it; the **era of experience** is here. Those that embrace it will thrive.
