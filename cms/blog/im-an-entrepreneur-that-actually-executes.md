I’m listening to [a Six Pixels podcast with Gary Vaynerchuk](http://www.twistimage.com/podcast/archives/spos-200---crushing-it-with-gary-vaynerchuk/). When asked, going through security at the airports, what he “does”, apparently Gary Vee has a hard time with the definition. As he says to Mitch in this interview, though (in classic Gary Vee style) – “I’m an entrepreneur that actually executes.”

Sure, it’s bold, sweeping, and no doubt mildly offensive to some. But it’s also true. And it made me think – all the authors I sat down with this year were talking about **doing**.

*   [Seth](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-1-with-seth-godin-the-linchpin-sessions/) talked about “shipping” – on time, and on budget, but above all, completing projects and sending them out the door.
*   [Roger Martin](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-3-with-roger-martin-mastery-innovation/) talked about trying – making mistakes on your way to innovation.
*   [Dan Pink](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-9-with-dan-pink-pink-inc-world-headquarters/) talked about the motivation of getting ourselves (and others) to **do**.
*   Sir Ken Robinson (interview dropping later this month) stresses the importance of creativity, and then defines creativity as the “**process** of having original ideas that **add** value.” (note the “doing” words)

I’ve met several people over the past few years who, upon learning what I do have replied, “Oh, I had that idea YEARS ago!”

Congratulations. What did you **do** with it?

There’s never been a cheaper, easier time to produce. To execute. To ship. There’s never been a better time than now.
