Through the immortal words of Jay Z, we’re reminded of the power of focus. (And, arguably, semantics.)

This has always been one of my favourite quotes, but I was reminded of it yet again, as I was reading through a back issue of _Inc._ The article was on Etsy.com, and founder Rob Kalin was quoted as saying,

#### “There’s this really interesting shift that happens when you’re running an Etsy business, where you have to change your approach from ‘I make clothing’ to ‘I’m making a living making a business that makes clothing.”

From 2007-2009, I was walking around saying “I review business books.” Which wasn’t far from the truth. I had a far-fetched business model, and no real focus on growing Actionable (Then Goose Educational Media) into anything more than a hobby. Granted, I had **desire** to grow it into something big, but there was no action. No focus.

Now, I say, “I run a business that helps professionals apply core messages from leading business books into their lives.” And there’s a power in that. It’s a constant reminder that if I’m not “running a business,” “helping professionals,” or “making business books actionable,” then I’m not focused on the right activities.

Where are you focusing your time and energy?
