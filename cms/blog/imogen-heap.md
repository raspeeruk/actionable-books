I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Imogen Heap perform this weekend, at a small private show in the Bahamas. If you’re not familiar with her music, I **highly** recommend you check it out. ([Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDxxLQDwJ7A), [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRrTPoqxNA8) or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWG7uywhBAc)) But be warned – Imogen doesn’t follow the rules. Her music is unconventional, and runs the gamete from traditional love ballads to synthesized-vocals-only tracks. And she pours herself into every song.

Imogen is a reminder that when you do what you love, people gather around you. And when you then take the opportunity to speak with those gatherers –to actually connect with them – truly [wonderful things](http://www.lovetheearthfilm.org/) can happen.
