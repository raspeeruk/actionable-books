**Our consultants aren’t like other consultants…** They’re colourful. They never settle for mediocre. And they ask _“Why?”_ often.

We thought it was time to introduce you to our _Actionable Consultants_. Today we’re getting to know [Bev Bourque](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/bev-bourque/) a little better, and finding out why the [**_Actionable Consultant Program_**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants/) **_(ACP)_** appealed to her.

**1\. Why did you become an _Actionable Consultant_?**  
I became an _Actionable Consultant_ because I found great alignment between Actionable’s approach to Leadership Development and my own approach. I am a huge advocate for Leader-led development and believe that development programs are much more impactful when the leader is leading the discussions with their employees. I was also very impressed with all of the workshops and felt that they would be an excellent resource for my coaching and consulting business.

**2\. What is your favorite part about being an _Actionable Consultant_?**  
I really feel like I am a part of a team and appreciate the support and connection with the other consultants.

**3\. What has surprised you about being a part of the _ACP_ Community?**  
I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of support that Actionable provides the consultants. I feel that [Darlene](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/darlene-huff/) is doing a fantastic job of keeping us all informed and with facilitating team calls to help build stronger connections between the _Actionable Consultants_. Chris is also very connected to the _ACP_ group and this shows that Actionable values the work of the _Actionable Consultants_.

**4\. What are you hoping to get out of your experience with Actionable**?  
My goal is to spread the word about Actionable Books and to build my coaching practice at the same time. I feel that so many leaders could benefit from Actionable Workshops and that coaching is a natural way to sustain the momentum gained from the workshops.

**5\. How would you describe the other Actionable Consultants?**  
Engaging — Insightful — Inspiring — Supportive

**6\. What is your mission in life?**  
My personal mission is to focus on what is important and to find fulfillment in the work that I do.

**_We are now accepting applications for the \*January 2014 ACP Class\*. If you are interested in learning more about the program, click_** [**_here_**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants/)**_, and apply before November 16._**
