**Our consultants aren’t like other consultants …** They’re colourful. They never settle for mediocre. And they ask _“Why?”_ often.

We thought it was time to introduce you to our _Actionable Consultants_. Today we’re getting to know [Parin Patel](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/parin-patel/) a little better, and finding out why the [**_Actionable Consultant Program_**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants/) **_(ACP)_** appealed to him.

**1) Why did you become an Actionable Consultant?**  
I believe that we should all be inspired, and engaged, in our lives. And since for many of us, a large part of that involves our work, why is that so many of us are not engaged by the work that we do? Why is it that we spend so much time doing something we’re not truly inspired or engaged by?

And so when I first spoke to Chris about becoming an Actionable Consultant, I knew this was something I wanted to do. I love the Actionable Books mission.

And I saw it as an opportunity to not only join a like-minded community, but also equip myself with some fantastic tools and resources to help in my mission to not only inform, inspire and motivate people to live their greatest lives, but to also help develop more inspired and engaged teams and leaders (which we all are).

Imagine, what the world would look like if we all were engaged by what we did every, single, day?

Imagine, what the world would look like if we were inspired in our lives?

**2) What is your favorite part about being a part of the ACP?**  
I love the Actionable Workshops and seeing how people not only become more self-aware and gain more clarity in their lives, but also the light bulbs that “go on”.

And I love how Chris and team have taken insights from these leading business and personal development books, and distilled them into these highly actionable workshops. You learn so much in that 1 or 1.5 hour session. And I love seeing the conversations and learning that happens.

**3) What is your personal and/or professional mission in life?**  
I find that too often, too many of us are still not living to our full potential (myself included – it’s an ongoing process). Why?

And why is it that so many of us still feel “stuck” in our professional lives? Why are we not inspired by what we do? Why are we “unhappy”?

I think we sometimes forget just how much our work impacts our personal lives (victims of our own routines perhaps). We forget that if we’re not satisfied with what we’re doing every day, that this has a very real negative impact on our personal lives.

We all want to do what love and be inspired, so why aren’t there more of us doing so?

So it’s my mission to not only inform, inspire and motivate people to live, and lead, their greatest lives, but to also help develop more inspired and engaged teams and leaders (which we all are) as well.

Because I’ve seen both sides. And being inspired and engaged is definitely more fun. 

**4) What has surprised you about being a part of the ACP community?**  
Good question. I wouldn’t say there have been any real surprises so far. But it’s really interesting to see the diverse background we have in the community.

**5) What are you hoping to get out of your experience with Actionable?**  
To grow and learn; and to really further my personal mission in helping as many people, teams and leaders as I can.

I truly want us to be inspired and engaged by what we do. Striving for our fullest lives. That doesn’t mean we won’t have “bad days”. But at least we’ll be inspired to get through those days when they show up.

**6) How would you describe the other Actionable Consultants? (in a few words)**  
Intelligent. Caring. Genuine. Leaders.
