**At Actionable Books we are incredibly grateful for the unique and diverse people who make up our team** and strive to celebrate them whenever possible.

Meet [Jakob Browning](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/jakob-browning/). He’s a fantastic writer and a member of the [Actionable Book Club](http://www.strikingly.com/abc2014).

Jakob recently completed his 10th Actionable summary. So we thought now was the perfect opportunity to find out a little bit more about him.

And if _you_ would like to join Jakob in our 2014 [Actionable Book Club](http://www.strikingly.com/abc2014), we are now accepting applications. **_Apply by November 22, 2013._**

**1\. What do you do when you’re not writing Actionable summaries?**

Run, read, and go on adventures with my wife. This summer we went camping, hiking, and exploring in 5 states and 2 countries.

**2\. How has Actionable Books impacted your life?**

By illustrating the power of acting on what you read. It is empowering to read through how others had broken down ideas in a book into something that could be applied.

**3\. What’s your favorite summary you’ve written so far?**

[_Start_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/start/) by Jon Acuff. Writing that summary inspired a number of other thoughts and conversations that I’ve had with myself and others that helped me progress on my own “road to awesome.” Also, Jon Acuff is hilarious, so going back and reading through my notes again was entertaining.

**4\. Where will you be one year from now?**

I finish graduate school in May so I would like to be in a position where I can help influence those around me for the better while providing for my family and having a lot of fun in the process.

**5\. Best advice you’ve ever been given…**

My father in law told me to “only take advice from those that have what you want, don’t take marital advice from the guy that has been divorced 6 times or traveling tips from someone that’s never left the country.”

**6\. Describe your own personal brand in 5 words or less.**

Nascent.
