**At Actionable Books we are incredibly grateful for the unique and diverse people who make up our team** and strive to celebrate them whenever possible. Joel D Canfield is one such person.

Joel has written 24 summaries for Actionable Books–more than anyone, with the exception of our founder, Chris Taylor. So we thought now was the perfect opportunity to find out a little bit more about Joel. And if _you_ would like to join our community of guest writers, learn more [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/actionable-books-guest-writing/).

**What do you do when you’re not writing Actionable summaries?  
**I’m a book shepherd: [Someday Box](http://joeldcanfield.com/) shows writers how to get their books written and self-published. Most of them need emotional support and motivation more than they need help with the mechanics or business stuff.

After teaching myself web design in 1995 I created my own company, Spinhead, in 1999. It still pays half the bills around here.

I’m a songwriter. Having moved to The Middle of Nowhere, my “anchor gig” as musicians call it is our own living room. But I’ve finally shared some of my music online and plan to compile the other 3 albums’ worth of music I’ve written.

**How has Actionable Books impacted your life?  
**Added structure.

As an artist, I tend to be lax about schedules and organization. Somehow Best Beloved compensates and keeps our businesses focused and orderly. But the regularity of writing a monthly summary and the process of extracting value from each book has fostered order in other areas of my life. I foresee that trend continuing, and I like it.

**What’s your favorite summary you’ve written so far?  
**Martin Seligman’s [_Learned Optimism_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/learned-optimism/) prompted the most personal summary I’ve written. I struggled for decades with the very problems this book resolves, simply and effectively. I should have bought it 20 years ago when it was written. I could have gotten a 10-year head start on my new life.

Anyone who reads this who has the slightest slices of discontent in their life should go, right now, and get a copy of “Learned Optimism.” It will change your life.

**Where will you be one year from now?  
**Putting the finishing touches on our plans to move to Killorglin, Co. Kerry, Ireland. My web business will be on autopilot, with others doing the day-to-day with little or no interference from me. My first serious mystery “anodyne” will be selling like hotcakes, and I’ll be celebrating the release of my non-fiction book “Commonsense Zero-Cost DIY Marketing for Authors” which will be an offshoot of the marketing process for “anodyne.” And I’ll be playing music, as always, and taking long drives with Best Beloved and talking about life.

**Best advice you’ve ever been given…  
**In an interview, Seth Godin said “I discovered that I wouldn’t die if someone laughed at me.” I needed to hear that. Now, I expect either bemused eye-rolls or angry emails because I’m a dissident in the world of publishing and art, and if I intend to become the High Priest of Self-Publishing, I must be impervious to unjust criticism.

**Describe your own personal brand in 5 words or less.  
**Performing dissident High Priest of self-publishing.
