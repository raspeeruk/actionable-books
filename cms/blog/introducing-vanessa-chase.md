**At Actionable Books we are incredibly grateful for the unique and diverse people who make up our team** and strive to celebrate them whenever possible.

Meet [Vanessa Chase](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/vanessa-chase/). She is an incredible writer and a member of the [Actionable Book Club](http://www.strikingly.com/abc2014).

Vanessa recently completed her 10th Actionable summary. So we thought now was the perfect opportunity to find out a little bit more about her.

And if _you_ would like to join Vanessa in our 2014 [Actionable Book Club](http://www.strikingly.com/abc2014), we are now accepting applications. **_Apply by November 22, 2013._**

**1\. What do you do when you’re not writing Actionable summaries?**  
Still writing, actually! I help non-profits tell their stories so that they can connect with their community in more meaningful and authentic ways. I write for some of my clients and also teach workshops to empower people with the skills and confidence to be an awesome storyteller.

**2\. How has Actionable Books impacted your life?**  
Writing for Actionable Books has been a truly amazing experience. I still remember when Chris called me last December to tell me that I had been selected to be part of the book club.

I read a lot but don’t always make the time to reflect on what I’m reading. Closing the loop through writing these summaries has really helped me implement a lot of what I learn. In many ways, I think it’s given rise to this year being a big experiment in lifestyle design.

**3\. What’s your favorite summary you’ve written so far?**  
I really enjoyed reading [_168 Hours_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/168-hours/) by Laura Vanderkam. I think this was the book that I got the most out of so far and I really loved being able to share a few tidbits of what I had tried from the book.

**4\. Where will you be one year from now?**  
I wish I had a crystal ball! I hope that I’ll still be doing lots of writing and teaching – it’s been really enjoyable so far. I’m nearing the point of hiring another employee and I think that will happen sometime next year. One of my goals is to spend at least 3 months of the year traveling, so maybe I’ll be on the road this time next year.

**5\. Best advice you’ve ever been given…**  
“Good things rarely happen by accident.” This was something that my dad said to me a few years ago and it’s really stuck with me. He is a proponent of working hard, being passionate and demonstrating commitment to the things you care about. With my transition to being an entrepreneur this year, I’ve really kept this advice top of mind when things seem tough.

**6\. Describe your own personal brand in 5 words or less.**  
Live with purpose. Convey gratitude.
