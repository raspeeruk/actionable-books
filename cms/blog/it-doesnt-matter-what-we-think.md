This week marked another first for Actionable – two summaries on the same book, each by a different guest writer. Both [Jill](https://www.actionablebooks.com/writers/jill-donahue/) and [Herbert](http://actionablebooks.com/writers/herbert-lui/) submitted excellent insight on Charles Duhigg’s _The Power of Habit_, so we decided to run both. While each summary is excellent, and both provide a solid overview of the book’s **content**, the guest writers selected different Insights – different aspects of the book that they felt were most impactful; most actionable.

It’s always interesting to me how different people can read the same book (watch the same movie, attend the same lecture, etc.) and come away with completely different insights. It’s worth restating that Actionable Books exists to give you an **introduction** to the popular books of the day. We provide you with a few ways to apply the ideas that **we feel are most valuable from the book**, and we hope that’s valuable for you. But I firmly believe that nothing replaces reading the book itself. If you find a summary that particularly resonates, consider picking up a copy for yourself. Hey, maybe you use Actionable as your “book shopping list recommendation engine”, picking one each month and adding it your collection.

If you read it (and I hope you do), and you feel that we’ve missed something important in our summaries – something that particularly resonated with **you** – please do the community a favor and post your thoughts at the end of the summary. Because at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter what we think. It matters what you do with the insights you glean, whether that’s from the summaries, or from the original book itself.

Onward.
