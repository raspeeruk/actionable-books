I was meeting with a potential client today, when they hit upon something important.

**A little context, first**: [Actionable Workshops](https://www.actionablebooks.com/workshops) are inspired by leading business books. Each module teaches a core skill or attitude drawing validation or support from a best selling author. They’re a unique format, in the sense that the workshops are presented by the internal team leader, rather than relying on an outside consultant. They’re fun, with each workshop designed to create one key takeaway that can be easily applied to life and/or business.

But, as the client pointed out today, the content is really the second most valuable aspect of the product. More than anything, the workshops act as an excuse to get everyone together, talking about something that is **not** the urgent “must do” tasks of the week. The workshops are about getting to know your people. It’s about connecting with your team on a human level, and helping them clarify their hopes and aspirations with the business. And, while the workshops offer a great framework for those conversations, you don’t need to be using our product to create those conversations with your own team. You really just need to make it a priority. When was the last time you engaged your team in real, meaningful conversation around where they’re going?

From my personal experience, people will bleed for you, if they know you care. Yes, it takes some time. Yes, it takes some planning. Mostly though, it takes courage; courage to step out of the urgent and focus on something a little scary, a little messy, and a little different than “business as usual”. But if you’re leading people, I’ve got to ask – **what could possibly be a more important use of your time?**
