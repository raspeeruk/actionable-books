I came across this story this morning and thought it worth sharing: [http://enterprisestrategies.com/2012/07/30/a-social-media-success-story-ups/](http://enterprisestrategies.com/2012/07/30/a-social-media-success-story-ups/) (it’ll take you two minutes to read)

I have no idea if [@AndyJankowski](https://twitter.com/andyjankowski) is a big deal online. My guess is neither did UPS. The fact is it doesn’t matter. From the sounds of the story, the response was personal, genuine and effective. When your brand is interacting with the “real world” (and if you’re running a real business, then it is), you need to be aware of the impact. Positive or negative, with clients **and** the general populous alike.
