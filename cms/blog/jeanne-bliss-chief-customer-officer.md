As we continue to see the rise of importance of relationships, and providing customers with an engaging, personalize experience, there’s a new role in town that we need to work into our businesses: That of the **_Chief Customer Officer_.** Chris traveled to Pacific Palisades, California to sit down with the woman who wrote the book on the subject (literally). Jeanne Bliss is a global thought leader and author on the subject of customer loyalty and engagement and, in this 30 minute interview, shares her insights into how we can actionably engage our most important people (our employees) with our _other_ most important people (our customers). Oh – and Jeanne snorts when she laughs. Highly entertaining!
