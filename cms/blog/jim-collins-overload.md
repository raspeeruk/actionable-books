Ok, I’m sorry. Yes, I realize the last two weeks’ newsletters have had nothing by the works of Jim Collins. Yes, I know his books are **already** on your radar, and that I’m not introducing you to anything new. But seriously… you’ve got to hand it to the guy. No other individual or organization has come close to the breadth and exhaustive depth of study into the inner workings of highly successful companies.

Not only am I a big fan of his writing style (interweaving empirical data with stories – both business and otherwise), I love how **digestible** he makes his research findings. How memorable. Let’s review the list:

*   BHAGs
*   The Stockdale Paradox
*   Level Five Leadership
*   The Hedgehog Concept
*   The Flywheel Effect
*   Getting the Right People on the Bus
*   The five Stages of Decline

And now, with _Great by Choice_, we’ve got:

*   The 20 Mile March
*   Bullets before Cannonballs
*   The Death Line
*   SMaC

I find the explanations clear, concise and instantly applicable. I can safely say that I’ve used more of Collins’ terms than any other author I’ve read. Not too shabby. **Do you have a favorite concept form a Collins book?** What do you think of Collins’ books in general?

Either way, that’s it. We’ve covered “the big four” now, and we won’t be referencing Jim Collins again for a while. We hope you enjoyed the education.
