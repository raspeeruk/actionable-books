Whatever your business, whatever your title or role, take time to connect with your clients/customers/users/patrons once in a while. Don’t get stuck in the weeds or ivory tower. Don’t make excuses.

It’s incredible how illuminating a 10 minute call can be with someone who’s on the receiving end of your product or service. In a worst case scenario, it’ll give you a sense of what needs to be improved. In a normal scenario, you’ll be reminded of just how impactful your work is on the world. One of the cheapest forms of motivation and encouragement I know.
