Some of you may remember that we published a limited run DVD last Christmas, showcasing the Actionable Interviews of 2010. It was a social experiment to see if we could create a _truly_ win-win-win model:

**Win #1:** You get 6.5 hours of brilliant, candid content from leading business thinkers of our time for $25.

**Win #2:** Increased exposure for the authors interviewed, as well as for us (ActionableBooks.com)

**Win #3:** All profit was donated to Room to Read, improving global literacy through the creation of schools and libraries.

In case you missed the outcome, we sold just over 500 DVDs in the pre-Christmas rush. We only have 200ish copies of the DVD left and, when they’re gone, they’re gone. We won’t be producing any more.

If you missed out on getting a copy and would like to do so, I’m making it available through [shoplocket](http://shoplocket.com)‘s nifty new embedder. You can buy directly through the link below.
