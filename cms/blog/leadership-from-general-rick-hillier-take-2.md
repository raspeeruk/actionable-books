A few weeks ago, [I posted about General Rick Hillier,](http://actionablebooks.com/unusual-sources/) and how we shouldn’t be too quick to decided where our insights and learnings should come from. I was revisiting my notes from his talk again today and, once again, I was impressed by the level of insight he offered.

Here was one of my favorites:

“As a leader, your job is quite simply about people.

*   Attract them
*   Enroll them
*   Equip and enable them to do the job
*   Recognize them for their accomplishments
*   Share their stresses. That’s when they need your leadership the most
*   When it’s time for them to go, treat them with respect and encouragement”

Easier said than done, no question, but it’s important to reconnect to the simplicity of strong leadership: Love your people, treat them well and expect their best. We all want strong leaders in our lives.
