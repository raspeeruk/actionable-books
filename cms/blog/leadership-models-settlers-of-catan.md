Like most business professionals who work in the consulting space, I’m a big fan of models; shortcuts that we can reference or leverage in various client settings to address common business problems.

Stephen Covey’s _Time Management Matrix_. \[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODyG5lKbH08&list=PLnX9bNckbqeHXj8vGY0e1REKtF3qb8Wvg&index=1)\]

Jim Collins’ _Hedgehog Concept_. \[[Collins explains in a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUrdbmNBpyY)\]

Nilofer Merchant’s _Air Sandwich_. \[[My interview with Nilofer](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/nilofer-merchant-avoiding-the-air-sandwich/) from _waaay_ back. Mind the hair.\]

Simon Sinek’s _Golden Circle_. \[[the classic TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4ZoJKF_VuA) for those who haven’t seen it yet\]

Simple concepts, all of them, yet robust enough to apply in many different situations, thus making them infinitely more useful than, say, a case study or overly complex model.

Perhaps _un_like most business professionals in the consulting space, I’m also a big fan of board games. And I think there’s a correlation. Let me explain.

A well-constructed board game, like a well thought out model, is fairly simple and quick to learn, yet robust enough to allow for creativity within the confines of its defined universe.

*   Too prescriptive and its value is limited.
*   Too vague and it’s too frustrating for those involved.

Like a board game, the limitations of a model need to be clear and straightforward… but flexible enough to allow for robust gameplay. Creativity thrives _within_ the confines of the defined and agreed upon structure. Nobody wants to play a game with no rules. Then again, Tic-tac-toe isn’t a whole lot of fun either.

_Speaking of models_, applications for the [Actionable Book Club](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/bookclub/) (ABC) are open for the summer cohort. All accepted applicants have the freedom to choose and write on a book of their choice each month… within the Actionable Summary format you’re familiar with. The act of choosing “the one thing” that most resonated with you from the book goes a **long** way towards putting the ideas into practice. The accountability group doesn’t hurt either. If you’re interested, applications are only open for a short window. You can [apply (and learn more) here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/bookclub/).
