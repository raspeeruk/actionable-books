Let’s start with “Happy New Year”! Early January is a great time to reflect, dream and plan, and I hope that you’re taking the opportunity to do so. As a reader of Actionable Books, you’re already proving that you have an interest in personal growth and professional development, and I hope that this year’s collection of articles and interviews proves valuable in your quest.

You may have noticed already that each article takes a single great idea (The The Big Idea) from a leading business book and provides you with two actionable takeaways (Insights) that you can put into effect immediately. There’s a reason we focus on one great idea from each book. Less is more. It’s so easy for us to read a book, attend an event or have a great conversation and want to make a dozen changes immediately. Sadly, we’re not wired that way. It’s proven time and time again that the most successful amongst us are particularly good at prioritizing, and focusing on a single (or at most, couple) things we want to action. Your New Years plans should be no different. Think about what you **really** want to get out of this year, identify a select few actions you think would most impact that growth, and act on them every day.

The secret to success isn’t sexy, but it is simple.
