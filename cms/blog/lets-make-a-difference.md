Support Room to Read, and get Seth Godin, Dan Pink and Gary Vaynerchuk for yourself!

Today, and today only, we’re doing a social media blitz to generate awareness for The Actionable Literacy Project. There’s two ways you can contribute, and support Room to Read.

1\. You can buy copies of the DVD for only $25 at [www.actionableliteracy.com](http://www.actionableliteracy.com)  
2\. You can “like” the [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Actionable-Literacy/148600648520690), or follow us and retweet [@actionablebooks](http://twitter.com/actionablebooks) on twitter.

The Actionable Literacy Project is a 12 interview DVD, containing candid and unedited conversations with Best-Selling, business book authors. There are some big names in the series, too, including Seth Godin, Dan Heath, Steve Farber and Sir Ken Robinson, to name a few. The conversations focus on employee success principles for the 21st century; explaining how “doing your job” isn’t enough any more… and what to do instead. The authors in this series donated their time to the project, allowing 100% of profits from the sales of these DVDs to support Room to Read; an organization dedicated to increasing global literacy.

For more information, or to purchase the DVD, visit [www.actionableliteracy.com](http://actionableliteracy.com)
