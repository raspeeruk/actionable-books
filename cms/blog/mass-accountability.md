During a session the other day, someone described **Policy** as “mass accountability”. Logically, this totally makes sense – policies are created to act in the best interest of the majority. The challenge, I believe, is the facelessness that comes with anything “mass”.

When I tell my wife or a good friend that I’m going to do something, the mental image of disappointing them is a strong motivator for following through. If I’m doing something because it’s policy, I lose that personal connection, that very real and very personal disappointment from someone I care about. I lose a strong motivator.

Policy and procedure are important, of course, and it’s difficult (if not impossible) to work with a large group of people without them. But I think to increase effectiveness, we need to reconnect with the faces, names and lives of the people we actually impact through accordance (or dismissal) of policy.

**Are your organization’s policies anchored by real stories?** By real impact on real people?
