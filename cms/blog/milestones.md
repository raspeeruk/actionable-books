A milestone is literally, “_a stone set up beside a road to mark the distance in miles to a particular place_.”

It’s not the end game.

It’s not waiting for you with champagne and photo-ops.

It’s simply an indicator of progress made, and a measure of distances to future locations.

As we publish our 750th free summary at Actionablebooks.com, I don’t want to downplay the significance – certainly the tireless efforts of [Andy](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/team/andy-budgell/), the dozens of [contributors](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/team/?filter=writer) and you, the reader, have made this endeavor possible and worth pursuing over the years. When I wrote my first summary back in 2008, I never would have imagined we would reach this stage, with the momentum we have behind us.

But it’s simply a marker. Like all markers, I believe it’s important to acknowledge, appreciate and celebrate ([_with a fairly nifty contest for you_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/giveaways/750th-actionable-summary-giveaway/)_, I might add_). It also give us opportunity to pause and reflect.

*   What have we learned?
*   What worked?
*   What didn’t?
*   What did we enjoy? What didn’t we enjoy?
*   What are we going to keep, kill or adjust?

We reflect, then continue down the path. There are exciting times ahead; here’s to summary 1000. Thanks for being here.
