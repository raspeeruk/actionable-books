For Alexis Ohanian it’s about [capitalizing on our open source internet](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/without-their-permission/).

To Tom Rath, it’s about taking time to [stretch and walk around](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/eat-move-sleep/).

In virtually **all** our summaries about creating a better life, upsetting the status quo, making a ruckus or generally getting more out of our days, the message is simply this – **move**.

“Motion creates emotion”, says Jim Young. (_As does Tony Robbins, according to a quick Google search_)

Get up. Get out of bed. Leave the comfort of the known. **Do something**. What’s holding you back from doing 10 jumping jacks right now? What’s stopping you from doing a Google search on the sommelier course you’ve been wanting to take? **Why aren’t you doing all the things you want to?** The things you know you should?

Stop thinking about it. Do it. **Move**.
