Read this in a [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/05/business/05ge.html?pagewanted=5&_r=1&ref=business&src=me) today:

“Leadership by fiat when done in moderation, Mr. Immelt says, can drive change and set a course. ‘I think that if you run a big company, you’ve got to four or five times a year, just say, “Hey team, look, here’s where we’re going,” ‘ he says. ‘If you do it 10 times, nobody wants to work for you. If you do it zero times, you have anarchy.'”

Thoughts?
