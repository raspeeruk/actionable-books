by James M. Citrin and Julie Daum

How often have you seen someone with great credentials and terrific buzz take an important job, but before long people are wondering “what exactly were we thinking?”

Getting the best person is less about finding an individual superstar and more about deeply understanding what your organization needs, the kind of person who will fit into your culture and bring the right experience and skills to get the job done.

Based on decades of experience at Spencer Stuart, the gold standard in executive search, Jim Citrin and Julie Daum cut through conventional wisdom and “rules of thumb,” whether the job that needs filling is that of CEO or a key leader in marketing, technology, finance, or human resources.

by Kathy Cloninger

Millions of American businesswomen, thought leaders, and politicians received their first lessons in salesmanship, money management, marketing, teamwork, and fulfillment in the Girl Scouts. The Girls Scouts has shaped the lives of more than 50 million alumnae alive today. Eighty percent of American female senior business executives and business owners are former Girl Scouts. In March 2012, the Girl Scouts will celebrate their 100th anniversary. _Tough Cookies_ captures the essence of this iconic organization and the principles that have allowed them to build and sustain a 100-year-old organization.

by Anthony J. Bradley and Mark P. McDonald

As a leader, it’s your job to extract maximum talent, energy, knowledge, and innovation from your customers and employees. But how?

In _The Social Organization_, two of Gartner’s lead analysts strongly advocate exploiting social technology. The authors share insights from their study of successes and failures at more than four hundred organizations that have used social technologies to foster—and capitalize on—customers’ and employees’ collective efforts.

But the new social technology landscape isn’t about the technology. It’s about building communities, fostering new ways of collaborating, and guiding these efforts to achieve a purpose.

[**RESPECT: Delivering Results by Giving Employees What They Really Want**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118027817/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118027817)  
by Jack Wiley and Brenda Kowske

Is it possible that the way to win in business is to give employees exactly what they want? Yes. As _RESPECT_reveals, managers and organizations who give their employees what they want outperform those who don’t. This is no hunch – it’s a fact based on more than 25 years of global research. Drs. Jack Wiley and Brenda Kowske have amassed a research database unlike any other, and it all started with this simple question: “What is the most important thing you want from the organization for which you work?”

Organizations that apply this research have more engaged employees, more satisfied customers, and better shareholder returns. It all boils down to seven key elements, summarized by the acronym RESPECT. These are the seven things that employees really want: Recognition, Exciting Work, Security, Pay, Education, Conditions and Truth.

This book taps the authors’ “in the trenches” consulting experience and offers real solutions on each element of _RESPECT_. Written for all types of leaders—from supervisors to the c-suite—readers can pick and choose the proven solutions that are relevant to their own organizations.

By weaving stories and narrative, the authors make complex information easy to understand and fun to read. In addition, _RESPECT_ meets the demands of the global economy, offering an international perspective with corresponding cultural nuances that are critical to helping leaders manage the needs of their workforces.

[**The Rare Find: Spotting Exceptional Talent Before Everyone Else**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591844258/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1591844258)  
by George Anders

Anyone who recruits talent faces the same basic challenge, whether we work for a big company, a new start-up, a Hollywood studio, a hospital, or the Green Berets. We all wonder how to tell the really outstanding prospects from the ones who look great on paper but then fail on the job. Or, equally important, how to spot the ones who don’t look so good on paper but might still deliver extraordinary performance.

Over the past few decades, technology has made recruiting in all fields vastly more sophisticated. Gut instincts have yielded to benchmarks. If we want elaborate dossiers on candidates, we can gather facts (and video) by the gigabyte. And yet the results are just as spotty as they were in the age of the rotary phone.

George Anders sought out the world’s savviest talent judges to see what they do differently from the rest of us. He reveals how the U.S. Army finds soldiers with the character to be in Special Forces without asking them to fire a single bullet. He takes us to an elite basketball tournament in South Carolina, where the best scouts watch the game in a radically different way from the casual fan. He talks to researchers who are reinventing the process of hiring Fortune 500 CEOs.

[**The Plugged-In Manager: Get in Tune with Your People, Technology, and Organization to Thrive**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470903554/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0470903554)  
by Terri L. Griffith

Too often discussions of management practice focus exclusively on managing people and organizational issues. Rarely, however, do they incorporate a discussion about technology or address all three dimensions in a balanced way. When they do, the result is game changing. In our hypercompetitive environment, those managers who are outstanding at being plugged into their people, technology, and organizational processes _simultaneously_ excel at coming up with effective business solutions.

_The Plugged-In Manager_ makes the case that being plugged-in—the ability to see choices across each of an organization’s dimensions of people, technology, and organizational processes and then to mix them together into new and powerful organizational strategies, structures, and practices—may be the most important capability a manager can develop to succeed in the 21st century. Step by step Griffith shows you how to acquire this ability.  
– Shows what it takes for business managers to succeed as technology and organizations become more and more complex  
– Profiles exceptional leaders and organizations who are plugged-in, such as Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos.com  
– Offers a fresh look at management issues

Filled with compelling case studies and drawing on first-hand interviews, _The Plugged-In Manager_ highlights this often neglected managerial capability and the costs of only focusing on one dimension rather than all three.

[**One Piece of Paper: The Simple Approach to Powerful, Personal Leadership**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118049594/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1118049594)  
by Mike Figliuolo

[**For Immediate Release: Shape Minds, Build Brands, and Deliver Results with Game-Changing Public Relations**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936661160/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1936661160)  
by Ronn Torossian

It is essential that businesses know how to communicate quickly, often preemptively, and effectively to survive—and at a cost that is far lower than comparable marketing and ad campaigns. The first book by the owner of a top 50 PR agency, _For Immediate Release_, Ronn Torossian reveals how public relations can do just that—while also defining brands; helping companies and individuals court the press or avoid it; growing business without alienating loyal customers; resolving crises quickly; and improving first page results on the most powerful search engine in the world (Google).

_For Immediate Release_ will show you how to:  
Frame the debate and control the conversation Use new and old media in tandem to find your audiences and create highly personal, relevant impressions tailored for them Promote the interests of your brand or business; deter or potentially stop what is not in your interest Build on great press, and avoid or minimize bad press Ensure the first thing people see about your business or brand during an Internet search is exactly what you want them to see Handle a crisis in the most effective and efficient manner See the positive difference effective PR makes through compelling case studies—Louis Vuitton, Fubu, BP, Toyota, Philip Stein, Zappos, and interviews with experts including Dr. Keith Ablow, political strategists Frank Luntz, Roger Stone and Hank Sheinkopf, and many others—and your own business.
