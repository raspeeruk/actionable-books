As students young and old headed back to school last week, they embarked on a new path of learning. With most schools organized into four month semesters, these students knew exactly what they would be learning between now and Christmas and, in most cases, have actively chosen the courses they’re taking. September marks a new beginning for them, and is often an exciting time infused with purpose.

For those of us NOT in a formal education program, it’s easy to let the weeks and months blur together without much differentiating our time other than the weather and changing seasons. But it doesn’t have to be. What could you commit to for be next four months? What project, what accomplishment or, yes, even what type of education? Knowing that you’re working towards something specific can give your actions purpose, and lead to more energy and engagement. It also makes you a more interesting person to be around.

The semester has already started for the “formal students”. Are you going to grow this fall, or defer for yet another semester? (Which begs the question – what are you waiting for?)
