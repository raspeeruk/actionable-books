“That’s ok, I’ll do it \[better/smarter/with more energy/classier\] next time.”

Here’s the newsflash: Next time doesn’t always exist. In fact, I would argue that the more important something is, the more impactful it could be, the less number of tries you’ll have it.

**Try telling the Olympic athlete that didn’t put everything they had into training that they’ll do better next time.**

Don’t wait for next time. Don’t chicken out and half ass it. If you need to do it twice, then do the “first time” ahead of time – visualize it or practice it. I don’t care what “it” is – the truly great opportunities are few and far between… and some are never again.
