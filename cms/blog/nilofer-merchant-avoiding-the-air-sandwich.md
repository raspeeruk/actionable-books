Chris caught up with Nilofer Merchant (author of [_The New How_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-new-how/) and president of Rubicon Consulting) in Montreal. For twenty minutes, they discussed the broken nature of the “air sandwich” that most companies are prone to eating, the rising need of employees to step up re. their engagement with the direction of projects and the company at large, and what the leader can do to facilitate such involvement. Nilofer’s a leading voice in the world of business strategy and, after 20 minutes of conversation, we start to understand why.
