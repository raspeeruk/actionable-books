Until fairly recently, I was the chef, cook and bottle washer when it came to [Actionable Workshop](https://www.actionablebooks.com/workshops) clients. I pursued the leads, made initial contact, closed the deal and remained point on all client relationships. I even wrote the contracts.

Over the last four months, our team has grown dramatically and, for the first time ever, we’ve welcomed on a client services team. Which also means, for the first time ever, I’m not necessarily the point person on all client interactions.

It’s easy to talk a good talk about the importance of “aligned values” and a “shared focus on delighting clients”. It’s another thing entirely to release the reins when it comes to the livelihood of your business. Here’s what I’ve come realize:

*   **Everyone’s got a different style**. A different personality. Trying to bend everyone to your own style is not only fruitless, it’ll drive away some truly wonderful people; people who want to express themselves in their own way.

*   **Clients have their own style as well**. Some clients that may not have resonated with me absolutely resonate with one or more of my teammates. And vice versa.

*   **There’s power in numbers**. Where I used to visit all clients on my own, I now make a point of bringing at least one other team member with me. It was nerve wracking at first, but I’m learning it’s really the only way to grow. And, once you get over the hurdle of understanding each other’s rhythm, it can be a ton of fun.

Growth tests your comfort zone, no question. Surround yourself with good people though; people who **believe what you believe**, even if they don’t act on it in the same way, and I think you can make the ride a whole lot smoother.
