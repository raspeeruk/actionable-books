We launched a partnership offer recently with the wonderful Art of Productions, that entitled attendees of the recent _Art of Leadership_ event a discount on our InFlight™ Workshops program. The deal was, $1 for a first month’s “test” access, and a recurring rate of $89/month ($10 off our regular rate) for every additional month they chose to stay on the program. Or, it was supposed to be. Somehow, in setting up a discount code for the attendees, we ended up putting the discounted rate at $89/**day** rather than $89/**month**. Thankfully, we recognized the problem and resolved it quickly.

But not quickly enough.

Before we could fix the glitch, one client purchased access to the tool and, in receiving her confirmation email, was no doubt shocked to see that her ongoing rate was going to be some 30x higher than she had expected. And that’s it. She’s gone. Cancelled her subscription and away she goes. And I can’t blame her for a second. _(She was good enough to send me a quick email confirming the reason she left – and even giving me that is going above and beyond)_

We’re consuming from a fire hose online and as soon as something tastes bad, we’re out. On to the next one. **Particularly** at the beginning of the relationship. If you’re fortunate enough to attract someone’s attention for a few nano-seconds, make sure that what they see is what they get. You’re not going to get a second shot.
