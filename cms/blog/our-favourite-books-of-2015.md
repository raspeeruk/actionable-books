_If there’s one thing we know at Actionable, it’s business books. (Okay, maybe one or two other things as well.) I asked my colleagues to select the book that resonated with them the most in 2015—admittedly no easy feat for any book lover! Some are new, others are old favourites, but all of them have something unique to offer. Check out our picks._

**_Becoming Steve Jobs: The Evolution of a Reckless Upstart into a Visionary Leader_ by Brent Schlender and Rick Tetzeli**

Impact. You need to keep fostering the relationships in your life that help you grow; the ones that change you for the better; the ones that help you show up in the world with you best art forward. It’s not easy to do that with the lenses that are all around us. Being true to who you are is where you start, every day. —_Lora Crestan, Regional Director of Consultant Services, Americas_

![carry-on-warrior](/assets/external/65d35b941e41f078b3d99db1_carry-on-warrior.jpeg)

**_Carry On, Warrior: The Power of Embracing Your Messy, Beautiful Life_ by Glennon Doyle Melton**

_Carry On, Warrior_ is is a compilation of essays that reminds me we’re not alone in this messy life. Glennon Doyle Melton’s honesty is so refreshing in a world that often boasts picture-perfect lives through carefully crafted social media. Hilarious and thoughtful, she invites the reader to embrace imperfection and live a life of love, bravery, and kindness. —_Anna Schmöhe, Graphic Designer_

![coaching-habit](/assets/external/65d35b78064be48d1883fb62_coaching-habit.jpeg)

**_The Coaching Habit: Say Less, Ask More & Change the Way You Lead Forever_ by Michael Bungay Stanier**

This yet to be released gem is destined to become a “must have” for all managers who aspire to be better leader-coaches for their teams. Insightful, humorous and immediately applicable for leaders at all levels. —_Chris Taylor, Founder_

![delivering-happiness](/assets/external/65d35b941e41f078b3d99dcc_delivering-happiness.jpeg)

[**_Delivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose_ by Tony Hsieh**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/delivering-happiness-2/)

I really loved this book because of the authentic stories from Hsieh’s life. He talks about the struggles of launching an online business that many people didn’t think would be successful. You can really tell he’s a guy who has learned from his failures and is open to continuing to try new ideas. If we can all aspire to create a company culture a little bit more like Zappos, the world would be a better place. I wish I had picked up this book earlier in my career! —_Peter Nakamura, Consultant Success Manager_

![](/assets/external/65d35b941e41f078b3d99db4_essentialism.jpeg)

[**_Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_ by Greg McKeown**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/essentialism/)

This was the first book I read for the year and I still say it has been the best book I have read (amongst a high calibre of other business books) all year. What resonated with me most was the three truths that embrace the core of _Essentialism:_ “I choose to,” “Only a few things really matter,” and “I can do anything but not everything”. The insights from _Essentialism_ gave me the courage to say ‘no’ to a good opportunity so that I could say ‘yes’ to a great opportunity. That said it has been a great year learning new skills and working with a fabulous group of people creating something pretty damn amazing!! —_Louise Davis, Regional Director of Consultant Services, Australia & New Zealand_

![elon-musk](/assets/external/65d35b941e41f078b3d99db8_elon-musk.jpeg)

**_Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future_ by Ashlee Vance**

My favourite (non-fiction) was probably _Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future_ by Ashlee Vance. I’ve always been a fan of the space program, so it’s no surprise that I’m excited by the advancement of private-sector endeavors like SpaceX. I’d say that the Tesla electric cars are the most exciting thing to happen to the automotive industry in a long time. This biography shows you the passion that Elon Musk has put behind both of these companies. It’s a tale of an entrepreneur who’s dreaming of big things, and taking big risks to get there. —_Shawn Hooper, Chief Technology Officer_

![optimistic-workplace](/assets/external/65d35b941e41f078b3d99da7_optimistic-workplace.jpeg)

**_The Optimistic Workplace: Creating a Workplace that Energizes Everyone_ by Shawn Murphy**

As Actionable’s Managing Editor I read more business book summaries than actual business books, but one that I read very recently tops the list: _The Optimistic Workplace_ by Shawn Murphy. It’s all about the importance of infusing purpose into work and creating a positive work environment, and how we’re all much more productive and engaged when they both work in concert together. This book is indispensable for any leader. _—Andy Budgell, Managing Editor_
