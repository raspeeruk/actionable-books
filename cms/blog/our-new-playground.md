A brand new site with lots to explore, with a few little gems along the way! Here are a few of the highlights:

1\. Based on the experiences I’ve had this year [interviewing some truly brilliant people](http://actionablebooks.com/media/videos/the-salaried-entrepreneur-tour/), we’ve organized actionablebooks.com around the theme of “The Salaried Entrepreneur”. What’s a Salaried Entrepreneur? Glad you asked…

_The internet has changed the rules for employees to be successful in the 21st century. With outsourcing on the rise, and technology replacing increasingly sophisticated roles at an alarming rate, putting your head down and blindly following direction is no longer a safe bet. In fact, if all you’re doing is what’s in your job description, you’re dead in the water – it’s only a matter of time. Add to that the unprecedented level of competition as we now wrestle for market share globally, and the old rules are out the window entirely. As companies – as individuals – we need to be lean, innovative and proactive. We need to care and we need to connect. We need to provide value. As far as I can tell, there are five main categories in which people need to understand if they wish to thrive in their professional careers. Those five categories –_ [_Self Management_](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/?cat=68#search-bar)_,_ [_Professional Maturity_](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/?cat=12#search-bar)_,_ [_Communication_](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/?cat=10#search-bar)_,_ [_Entrepreneurial Thinking_](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/?cat=11#search-bar) _and_ [_Leadership_](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/?cat=7#search-bar) _make up the five building blocks of what we call, “A Salaried Entrepreneur”._

All our content – our articles, our workshops, and soon to be our videos (stay tuned) are organized by which section of the Salaried Entrepreneur they best support. It’s my hope that you will review the five sections of the Salaried Entrepreneur wheel (found on [the workshops page](http://actionablebooks.com/workshops/) – just click a section of the wheel to learn more about it) and work to develop yourself in the areas you most think you need it.

2\. To help with your journey we’ve added discussion sections for each of the articles, in the hopes that you will be able to strike up conversation with other travelers like you, looking to discuss some of the concepts from the article in more detail. For even more robust conversation, you can get involved with our Facebook Page or say hi on Twitter and interact with us, and other readers, in real time.

3\. Be sure and check out [your dashboard](http://actionablebooks.com/dashboard/) as well. From there you’ll be able to access any articles you’ve bookmarked (or workshops, if you’re a Premium user and lead a team), should you decide to start building a collection of Insights and The Big Ideas to put into practice in your own life. The dashboard is also where we’ve got some great tool development planned for the future. It’ll be a bit yet, but I’m excited about some of the things we have brewing…

Other than that, please explore! As mentioned there are a few little treats hidden in some of the darker corners of the site, including author bios, some info on our fabulous (and growing!) guest writer team and more. Have fun, play nice, and let us know if you have any questions.
