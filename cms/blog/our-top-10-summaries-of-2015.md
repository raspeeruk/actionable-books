Earlier this year marked the publication of the 750th Actionable Summary! (at the time of this writing we’re clocking in at 823!) With the year quickly drawing to a close, we wanted to countdown **our top 10 most popular summaries of 2015**. We also want to take a moment to celebrate the dozens of dedicated individuals who make these summaries possible. Actionable wouldn’t be the resource that it is without them.
