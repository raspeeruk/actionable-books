While the arrival of spring doesn’t always bring with it spring-like weather (I know many of you are nodding your head in agreement right now), one thing is for certain: a stack of great new business books to read.

We’ve poured over the lists of upcoming books to bring your our short list of the top 4 books we’re most excited to read this spring from some of our favourite authors such as **Chris Guillebeau**, **Dan Pontefract** and **Patrick Lencioni**.

**_Born For This: How to Find the Work You Were Meant to Do_ by Chris Guillebeau**

Are you currently doing the work you were meant to do? If you just answered no to that question, bestselling author Chris Guillebeau has written _Born For This_ just for you. Readers will discover how to “Hack the job of your dreams within a traditional organization by making it work for you, find not only your ideal work but also your ideal working conditions, create plans that will allow you to take smarter career risks and ‘beat the house’ every time, start a profitable “side hustle” and earn extra cash on top of your primary stream of income” and more. In anticipation of Chris’s upcoming book, check out our [summaries](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/authors/chris-guillebeau/) of some of his previous books.

**_The Happiness Equation: Want Nothing + Do Anything = Have Everything_ by Neil Pasricha**

I’m cheating a little bit with the inclusion of _The Happiness Equation_ as it was actually published a couple of weeks ago. But I couldn’t resist making an exception because Neil Pasricha’s book came highly recommended from our good pal Michael Bungay Stanier and has soared to the top of the bestseller lists. This buzzed about book promises to disclose the formula for the perfect life (spoiler: it’s revealed in the book’s subtitle). It’s “a book that will change how you think about everything—your time, your career, your relationships, your family, and, ultimately, of course, your happiness.”

**_The Ideal Team Player: A Leadership Fable About the Three Essential Virtues_ by Patrick Lencioni**

Patrick Lencioni is one of the most respected and prolific business book authors writing today. _The Ideal Team Player_ picks up where the highly influential [_Five Dysfunctions of a Team_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/) left off. The book offers effective strategies to build a winning team in the 21st century and promises to help the reader “Discover the types of people every team needs, learn the three critical traits used to evaluate team players, \[and\] utilize evaluation criteria on an ongoing basis. Customize a proven system for building your ideal team.” To tide you over until the book’s publication next month, why not revisit our podcast interview with Patrick where he discusses leadership vulnerability [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/podcast/012-leadership-vulnerability/).

**_The Purpose Effect: Building Meaning in Yourself, Your Role and Your Organization_ by Dan Pontefract  
**

Dan Pontefract, the bestselling author of [_Flat Army_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/flat-army/), is back with an all new book, _The Purpose Effect_. In it “Pontefract combines years of experience and research on employee engagement to create a work about the three crucial areas of purpose: individual, workplace role, and organizational. When one area is lacking, this three-legged barstool starts to wobble, and the results range from disengagement to bankruptcy.”

_Which book are you most looking forward to reading this spring?_
