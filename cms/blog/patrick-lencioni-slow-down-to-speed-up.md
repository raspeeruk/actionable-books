Pat and Chris sit down for their second conversation around Healthy Organizations. This time they’re discussing:

– Achieving today’s competitive advantage in business  
– Why Healthy trumps Smart… always.  
– How “culture development” is NOT touchy-feely  
– The three biases that hold leaders back from building healthy organizations  
– Why team size should cap at 9 people

Check out our first conversation [here](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/patrick-lencioni-the-value-of-vulnerability/), as well as our summaries of [_The Advantage_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-advantage/), [_Getting Naked_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/getting-naked/), [_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/), and [_Death By Meeting_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/death-by-meeting/).
