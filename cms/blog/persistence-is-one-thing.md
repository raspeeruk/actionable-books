Mechanical grinding is another. Like clockwork, I received another letter in the mail from “the other telecom” provider today. Every 6-8 work days I get an offer in the mail, every two weeks or so I get a phone call. And I’ve told them – every time they’ve called, for the last two months – that I’m not interested. That they should take me off their list. Every time, they tell me they will.

Their marketing department is broken. They’ve taken me from simply not choosing them, to actively petitioning friends and family not to use them. I would think those direct mail pieces are most likely not having the impact intended.

I think the biggest irony is that all the promo pieces they send use price as their big draw… and price is exactly why I left them in the first place. (4 years ago, by the way.)

It’s scary to think that with multi-million dollar marketing budgets, these guys can’t get it right. It’s like giving a bazooka to a toddler.
