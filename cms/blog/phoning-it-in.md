There’s an expression in the film industry of “phoning it in”. Every once in a while a big name actor will do “just enough” on a project; effectively relying on their name and reputation alone to sell tickets to their latest movie. It’s easier, it requires less effort and commitment and, for the short term it has little impact on their career. They produce more content and collect another paycheque. If they take flack for a less-than-stellar performance, they can inoculate themselves by saying, “That’s fine, it wasn’t my best work anyway. I’ll make the next one Oscar-worthy.”

**The challenge is, we have enough content.** We’re inundated by it, in fact. What people want – what we want – is passion-filled people producing art. Individuals creating to the best of their ability; making themselves vulnerable to criticism by taking chances and stretching themselves. Yes, it’s riskier. Yes, it takes more effort. But if you don’t do it, someone else will.

**What’s the “little bit more” you could do to create something you’re proud of?** Do that.
