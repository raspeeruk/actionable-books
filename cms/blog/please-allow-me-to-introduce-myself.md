My name is Sara, and I am Actionable’s new Managing Editor. I’ve had the pleasure of getting to know a few of you already, but I’d like to introduce myself to those I haven’t met yet.

I’ve been a reader and a writer for as long as I can remember. I’ve studied literature and publishing both academically and personally, and you will never catch me without at least one book and notebook on my person at all times.

I love being an editor—working with authors to make a piece of writing shine, eradicating errors and awkward phrasing, and creating clean and persuasive copy. For the past few weeks, I’ve been working with members of the Actionable team and community to do all of those things. As an editor, I always strive to preserve the writer’s voice and intention, and I feel the most successful when my influence is completely undetectable. And I’m working to get better every day.

As the inimitable Andy goes on a [well-earned sabbatical](https://actionable.co/thoughts/life-at-actionable/2016/09/sabbatical-dream-come-true/) I will be stepping in to manage the Actionable Book Club and the weekly digest, along with content for the rest of the Actionable universe (have you seen our [new websites](http://actionable.co) yet? They are gorgeous). Anyone who has had the pleasure of working with Andy will understand that I have big shoes to fill.

So I’d like to ask for your help. The Actionable community is jam-packed with smart, funny, thoughtful, and interesting people who could teach me a lot about the world. A big part of being an editor is understanding that there’s a lot I don’t know, and being willing and able to track down those answers, learn from my mistakes, and improve with practice. Please know that my (virtual) door is always open, and I’d love to hear more about you, our readers. What interests you? What have I missed? What have we done brilliantly, and what do we need to work on? Are you interested in writing for us?

I’ve only been a part of the Actionable team for a few weeks now, but I already feel like I’ve found my tribe. Over the coming weeks and months I look forward to getting to know you all better, to reading (and editing) your writing, to hearing your ideas, and to working hard to deliver the high quality content that you’ve come to expect from Actionable in your inboxes every week. I’m pleased to meet you!
