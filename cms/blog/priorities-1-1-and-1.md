How many #1 priorities do you have?

Priorities shift. As we grow, experience and mature, new opportunities will inevitably present themselves; opportunities that are justifiably exciting. And that’s fine. But you would also gain immensely from a message an old mentor shared with me, “You can do two things well, or one with excellence. You choose.”

How often do you review your priorities? By definition, you can’t have more than one #1 priority. Do you know what yours is? Are your actions reflecting it?

There’s a tremendous power to singular focus. Which isn’t to say everything else has to go away; it’s all about determining what you should be acting on based on where you want to go.
