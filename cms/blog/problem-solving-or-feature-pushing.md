Most of us are professional problem solvers. Regardless of our title, role or industry, most of us are compensated and recognized for our ability to identify problems (in some cases, before they come up), define a solution for them, and then resolve them – as efficiently and effectively as possible.

So long as we’re competent, there are really only two challenges we need to watch for then.

1\. That we’re not burying our heads in the sand (ignoring potential problems), and

2\. We don’t get too attached to one solution.

I don’t know that the second one gets enough attention. Circumstances change. We gain new insight or information. New technologies are developed. Any number of reasons could justify revisiting our intended solution to see if there’s a better fit. Don’t let ego, stubbornness or frustration get in the way of a better outcome.
