In the work that I do, I’m privileged to meet with some truly wonderful entrepreneurs; successful individuals who never stop searching for what comes next. They never stop being curious.

I met one such individual, Bari Lyman at an exclusive, one day event with ten entrepreneurs at Seth Godin’s office where we received coaching and mentorship from Mr. Godin himself on our businesses, plans and problems. It was a transformative event and included some truly awesome people.

So back to Bari – Bari founded a technical recruiting firm back in 2000 and has, since then, realized some fairly excellent levels of success. Which begs the question why – when having the opportunity to pick Seth’s big brain on her business – she chose to focus not on her IT recruiting firm, but on a new venture, _Meet to Marry_.

As Meet to Marry hits the streets in a big way this year, I had the chance to catch up with Bari and ask her a few questions. Check out how some highly influential business books sent her down a path to personal happiness…

**WHY THE TRANSITION?**

_“BreakthroughIT started in 2000 is a virtual recruiting that places all kinds of talent from software engineers at startups to contractors to Fortune 100 firms. It was exciting and dynamic growth process, but after 10 years of recruiting and the ups and downs of that business cycle and intensive deadlines, I decided I wanted to help more people in even bigger ways than simply their recruiting needs. So I took my passion and skill of empowering and matching people and applied it to helping singles break through their barriers to finding love.”_

**HOW WAS MEET TO MARRY BORN?**

_“After reading the_ [_4 Hour Work Week_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-4-hour-workweek/) _and actually doing the 30 day challenge, I found a business coach and marketing mentor who had me do a_ [_Blue Ocean Strategy_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/blue-ocean-strategy/)_. I learned online marketing, how to find your niche online, wrote my book, hired a book agent….and that was the birth of the Meet to Marry revolution.”_

**WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED FROM THE TRANSITION?**

_“It’s important to have a big dream and a vision, but you also need a plan. Learning online marketing and having an implementable strategy is key or the message doesn’t get out there to people who want it. And as Seth Godin taught me on the day I met you (Chris), “get out there and do scary things. Be bold.” The second lesson is that it’s critical to have an amazing team of_ [_Linchpins_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/linchpin/) _who believe in the dream.”_

I couldn’t agree more.
