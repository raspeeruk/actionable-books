Reading Susan Cain’s _Quiet_ over the last couple weeks, I was fascinated by discussions around the introverted business leader. I think many of us think of leaders as strong presenters with a quick wit and a warm smile – someone who can work the crowd. Yet Cain reminds us that Jim Collins’ “Level 5 Leadership” (the key characteristics of the top management executives he studied for _Good to Great_) means being humble, understated and ferociously committed to a goal for the good of the company. Cain goes on to further explain studies have shown that pro-active, goal oriented employees – the kind of employees we call “Salaried Entrepreneurs” and are crucial to 21st century success – thrive **_better_** under the leadership of introverts than extroverts. (Passive, “follow directions only” employees perform better under the leadership of extroverts, it turns out).

If we think of the 20th century as a “Command and Control” era of leadership, and the 21st Century as more a time of a Servant Leadership, perhaps it’s time to reconsider those we’re grooming for eventual C-suite spots? Perhaps it really is time for the meek to inherit the earth.
