In this week’s newsletter we explored _Gamestorming_ and _No Problem_; two books designed explicitly to help you navigate the murky waters of complex business challenges.

In reviewing the two books, I started thinking about the power of re-framing; that is, looking through existing problems in a new light.

If you’ve ever played the game _Boggle_, you know that one of the easiest ways to find new words on the board is to turn the board; to look at it from a new angle. What’s true in game is often true in life.

If you have a nagging problem that’s been hanging around for a while, perhaps it’s time to turn the board. Think through questions like,

– Where’d the problem come from?  
– What’s it actually holding us back from? Is there another way to accomplish the same objective?  
– If the problem was permanent (as in, here for good), what would we do instead?  
– How would I handle the problem if I was Donald Trump? Mother Teresa? Kanye West?  
– Problems often exist because of a _lack_ (or a perceived lack). Does this problem exist because of lack of money? time? knowledge? What’s another way I could overcome the lack?

Share the problem with a friend. Share the problem with a stranger. Look for new takes on it.

Bottom line – stay curious. Look with fresh eyes, and think of the problem as something interesting, rather than something nagging. Have fun!
