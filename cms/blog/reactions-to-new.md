When you launch something new, if you’re lucky, people want to engage with it. (Nonchalance is the _worst_ reaction you could have.)

If (hopefully) people are passionate about the idea, they’ll (typically) either be lovers or haters.

If they hate it, listen for the constructive bits, and leave the majority of it alone.

If they love it, they’ll (typically) either want to leverage it, or they’ll want you to change it.

There’s a time for each. There’s rarely a time for both.

**What type of people do you need right now?**
