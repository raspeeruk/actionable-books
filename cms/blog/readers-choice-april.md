**2\. _Imagine: How Creativity Works_ by Jonah Lehrer**  
From the _New York Times_ best-selling author of _How We Decide_ comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative “types,” Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. It’s a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively.

**3. _Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive_ by Bruce Schneier**  
In this insightful and entertaining book, Schneier weaves together ideas from across the social and biological sciences to explain how society induces trust. He shows how trust works and fails in social settings, communities, organizations, countries, and the world.

**4\. _Flip the Funnel: How to Use Existing Customers to Gain New Ones_ by Joseph Jaffe**  
Using \[the\] new “flipped funnel” model, together with a set of new rules of customer service and a revolutionary customer referral and activation process, you’ll learn how to transform your existing customers into your best salespeople. In addition, Jaffe will explain how to best introduce and combine both digital and social media tools to boost your loyalty arsenal, deploy “influencer marketing” and implement word-of-mouth strategies that inspire your loyal, opinionated, and most vocal customers to become credible, persuasive, and influential endorsers of your products and services.
