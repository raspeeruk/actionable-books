[**2\. Confessions of a Reformed Control Freak** by B.R. Smith](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IXSR36/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=gooseducmedi-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005IXSR36)

Managers aren’t born – they’re made. Communicating and interacting more effectively with people is a learned behaviour. I wrote this book in the hope that managers, team leaders and supervisors are able to learn from my sins. And trust me – in my 40+ year career as an award-winning entrepreneur and general manager for one of Canada’s best managed and most profitable companies, I’ve committed each one of these sins at one time or another.

“The Top Ten Sins Most Managers Make & How to Avoid Them” are woven into the ten chapters of this book. I know from my own experiences what works – and more importantly – what doesn’t work. If I knew then what I know now, there is no question I would have managed differently. After reading this book you will manage differently too.

Managing today is about attitude – not aptitude. You don’t need to be the smartest person in the room to be the most effective manager in the room. Today’s manager needs to do three things very well. They need to be able to communicate, educate and delegate. This book will teach you how to develop a 21st Century management style, improve individual and team performance, create lasting relationships and manage conflict, problem solve and deal with stressful situations better. And most importantly, it will teach you how to communicate and interact more effectively with clients and colleagues.

In a world inundated with sales books on getting to yes, this book recommends just the opposite, focusing on how increasing your failure rate can greatly accelerate your movement toward ultimate success.

Through the dialogue of the two main characters the authors have fashioned an entertaining story to present the key concepts essential to sales success. Readers learn… …What it takes to outperform 92% of the world s salespeople …That failing and failure are two very different things … Why it s important to celebrate success and failure … How to get past failures quickly and move on …That the most empowering word in the world is not yes… it s NO! Written to be intentionally short and to the point, Go for No! is a quick, fun read with valuable lessons that can change the way you think, sell, and live!
