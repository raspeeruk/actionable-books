Who’s on your team?

I’m not talking about your assigned work team. I’m talking about your tribe. Your essence. Your mojo. **Who around you just “gets it” and supports you because of it?** Who’s in your corner, even if you don’t really know each other that well?

Don’t try to define it. Just recognize it when you see it. Keep your eyes peeled for the next member of your team. They’re ready for you… and they want to help you grow.
