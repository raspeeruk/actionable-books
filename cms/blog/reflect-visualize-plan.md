I wrote about this around this time last year, and I’ll likely keep writing about it for the years to come: my favorite part of this holiday season is the opportunity it affords us to take a collective pause and get centred (again) as to where this high speed journey is headed.

You’ve worked hard this past year. You’ve had some wins, some setbacks and (hopefully) some insights along the way. Next year will be much of the same. The only real difference is where you’re headed; what you’re working towards and why.

For the better part of 8 years, I’ve been using [this document](https://d3mkywnuoki91n.cloudfront.net/actionablebooks-com-wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Annual_Planning_Review.pdf), over the course of 1 to 2 days as my guide in reflection on the year coming to a close, for visualizing the year ahead, and then setting a plan that aligns with my adjusted objectives and refined values. It might be useful for you to. Or it might not. It’s simply my process and I wanted to share.

Regardless of your strategies, I hope you take the time over the holidays to reflect, visualize and plan. It’s your life. No one else is going to do it for you.

Here’s to your growth this past year, and a powerful 12 months ahead. It’s going to be quite a year.
