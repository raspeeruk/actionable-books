It’s a mission of ours here at Actionable to bring business book lovers closer together. (Think of us as like a dating site for business book aficionados without the, uh… dating.)

That’s why we’re excited to announce the return of **#BizBkChat**. That’s right. We’ve dusted off the cobwebs, made a few tweaks and we’re ready to start discussing the latest books hot off the presses as well as all of your old favourites. Rather than meet once a week at a specified time, jump into the conversation whenever it suits you, day or night.

So, how do you find us?

Head on over to Twitter and input the hashtag **#BizBkChat** in the search field at the top right of the page.

![#BizBkChat](/assets/external/65d3622bcaa6519171eeaf42_bizbkchat.png)

This will pull up the latest Tweets and can then hop into the conversation by responding to any Tweet that strikes your fancy.

See you all you book lovers there!
