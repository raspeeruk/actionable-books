In our second sit down interview with Roger Martin (Dean of Rotmanâ€™s School of Management and author of [_The Opposable Mind_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-opposable-mind/) and _Design of Business_), we discussed his latest work: [_Fixing the Game_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/fixing-the-game/).

Roger and Chris discussed corporate compensation models, similarities between the stock market and sports betting, and purity of small business.
