In the final installment of the [2010 From the Horse’s Mouth](http://actionablebooks.com/media/videos/the-salaried-entrepreneur-tour/) author interview series, Chris sat down with the one and only [Sir Ken Robinson](http://actionablebooks.com/authors/sir-ken-robinson/) – subject of the wildly popular TED Talks “[School Kills Creativity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY)”, author of [_The Element_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-element/), and global thought leader on Innovation and Educational Reform. Over the course of this 40 minute discussion, Ken and Chris talk LOL Cats, misconceptions about Intelligence and the importance of being engaged in work that you love.
