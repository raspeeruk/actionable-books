With May practically upon us (how did that happen?), and the summer just around the corner, we’ve decided to focus this weeks collection of articles on Personal Productivity and Organization. How do the two relate, you might ask?

For most industries, the summer is slow. Business deals drag, product launches are few and far between and you get as many “out of office alerts” as you do actual email responses. Which means we’re entering the perfect time of year for a little organization and spring cleaning. In order to fully enjoy your summer breaks, BBQs and camping trips, why not take some of your working time to get caught up; to get a system in place for handling the deluge of work that’s bound to come in September, and to build a platform for generating (and acting on) great new ideas you have during this more relaxed pace?

Both David Allen, with [Getting Things Done](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/getting-things-done/) and [Making it All Work](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/making-it-all-work-part-1/) and Scott Belsky in [Making Ideas Happen](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/making-ideas-happen/), have outlined brilliant systems for getting and staying organized, both personally and professionally.

Remember to enjoy yourself this summer, but also that the “slow seasons” are fantastic opportunities for a little reflection, planning and strategy for the creating the future you want.
