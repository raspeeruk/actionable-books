Last Friday, to a small group of friends, we quietly announced the launch of a [new program](http://bootcamp.actionablebooks.com), designed to help Consultants and Coaches grow their respective practices. It was the first time we’d launched a program like this, and it got me thinking about the act of **creating** in business.

As we’re also trying something new with regular video updates for business owners, I created a short video with some of my key “actionable” takeaways from the experience:

I think the biggest learning, though – not shared in the video – was how quickly we could bring something like this to life. The team strategized about this through the last two weeks of April, created a timeline May 1st, and the program is launching June 13th. Think about that – we had a team of 4 working on this, on a shoe-string budget, and were able to put this together – from inception to launch – in less than 2 months.

I work with [a fabulous team](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team), no question. But so do you. My encouragement, if you have the slightest urge to launch something – to create something new – is **do it**. The summer’s likely going to be a quieter time for your business (as quiet as it will ever be, at any rate). Give it a shot. What have you got to lose?
