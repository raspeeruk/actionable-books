While Innovation is THE corporate buzzword of the decade, there are few who understand the term as well as Steve Shapiro. Shapiro has been studying cultures of innovation for over 15 years and has written 3 books on the subject.

During this 27 minute interview with Chris, he imparts some of his wisdom from his home in Quincy, Mass.
