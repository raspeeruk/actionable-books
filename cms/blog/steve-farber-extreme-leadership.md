Steve Farber, best selling author of The Radical Leap, The Radical Edge and (most recently) Greater Than Yourself is President of the Extreme Leadership Group, a highly sought after public speaker and a subject matter expert on leadership in the 21st century. In November, he sat down with Chris in San Diego to talk about his new book, his unique writing style, and how the Golden Rule is making a comeback in business. (26 minutes worth watching)
