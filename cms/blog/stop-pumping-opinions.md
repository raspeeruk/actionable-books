**Opinions:** just like a heartbeat, everyone’s got one. **_Also_** just like a heartbeat, the constant pumping of opinions, for many people, seems almost involuntary.

I have people tell me regularly that I’m working too hard. I appreciate their concern, but I have to balance that concern with the knowledge that these good Samaritans don’t (usually) have the full picture of what I’m working towards.

The challenge with opinions (especially the unsolicited ones) is that they’re driven by the beliefs, work ethic and – often times – agenda of the person who’s pumping them out. It’s a rare thing indeed to be on the receiving end of an opinion that truly has your best interest and personal objectives at their core.

I’m not saying people are deliberately malicious or self serving. In fact, I believe that most opinions and “suggestions” come from a place of genuine desire to help … which makes them that much more insidious and potentially crippling to your long term goals.

If you want to achieve more than most people, if you want to build a legacy bigger than most, then you’re going to be working against the opinions of most, more often than not. My general motto is to take opinion, advisement and suggestion graciously, but cautiously … particularly if it’s coming from someone that doesn’t share – or doesn’t understand – what you’re working towards.

The counter balance is to surround yourself with people who **do** get it. People who dream as big as you do, and support you in your efforts to create the life of your dreams. Even a handful of these people will make a massive difference in your commitment to follow through … despite the opinions of others.

_This is really what I love about the Actionable Community. Every day I_ _have the distinct privilege of interacting with people who dream big. Who work hard. Who are building something great. It’s also what I love about our_ [_Actionable Consultant Program_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants) _(ACP) – these individuals, more than any other group of people I associate with, aren’t afraid of hard work in service of their greater ambitions. I’m equally excited that we’re growing the ACP this year with the addition of 20 top quality coaches, consultants and facilitators. If you’re a consultant who believes in the importance of lifestyle design and are interested in learning more about the ACP, I invite you to join a webinar I’m running on the_ [_19th_](https://actionable.webex.com/mw0307l/mywebex/default.do?nomenu=true&siteurl=actionable&service=6&rnd=0.9199775424396734&main_url=https%3A%2F%2Factionable.webex.com%2Fec0606l%2Feventcenter%2Fevent%2FeventAction.do%3FtheAction%3Ddetail%26confViewID%3D1091670658%26%26%26%26siteurl%3Dactionable)_._
