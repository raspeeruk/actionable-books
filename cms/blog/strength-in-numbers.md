We posted our 500th Actionable Summary this week.

It’s with intense pride and more than a little amazement that I share this news with you. When I wrote my [first summary](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/one-minute-millionaire/) back in 2008, I certainly did not envision the site as you see it today. The goal was originally to read a book each week for a year, applying one concept from each into my life and thereby changing the way I interacted with the world. The summaries were little more than an accountability vehicle for me to monitor progress and stay on track.

Now, just over five years later, the idea has become a company, the company has attracted [a team](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/?) of exceptional individuals, an elite group of [forward thinking consultants](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants/) and a veritable army of [summary writers](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/?filter=writer).

It’s a little misleading that I should be the one to pen the [500th summary](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/leaders-eat-last/) when, as of this writing, _volunteer_ writers have produced 337 of the personality-infused summaries you’ve come to appreciate from the site. It’s really these passionate, intelligent, curiosity-filled people that we have to thank for the growth of the site over the years. 87 writers to date and growing; each having contributed their own voice – their own style, insights and topics – to make Actionable a truly unique place to be. Thank you.

And the best part is, we’re just getting started. [Andy Budgell](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/andy-budgell/) – our managing editor – is currently co-ordinating, curating, editing and posting **five new summaries each week.** I’m back on the wagon with [author interviews](https://www.actionablebooks.com/blog/categories/business-book-author-interviews/), with three lined up for the next few months. We’ve even started building relationships with publishing houses to ensure our summaries are coming to you in time with the new releases (_and dare we say, maybe even before hand_?).

We grow because of our incredible volunteers. We grow because of the people in this community who pick up the torch and add value in their own personal way. We grow because you care enough to be here. We grow because **this community is full of people who give a damn**.

Thank you for reading. Thank you for caring enough about your own professional development that you’d dedicate some of your precious time to these summaries. **Thank you for being here**.
