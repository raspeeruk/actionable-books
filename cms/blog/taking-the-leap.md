_An excerpt from Beyond the Picket Fence:_

In my experience, it’s rarely a leap. Instead, it’s a series of small steps. The occasional larger step. Almost all of them things you can come back from. You’re a talented, capable, in demand person. I know that because you’re reading this book. (which is not a comment on this specific book, but the fact that you’re reading a book like this at all.)

In my interview with [Jon & Alison Suter](https://simpletax.ca/about), this was the biggest theme that kept emerging – you can always go back. If you’re curious about what’s around the corner, go take a look. Like what you see? Go a few steps further. You can always go back.

The idea of “going all in” or “burning your boats” is sexy. It’s exciting to read _Fast Company_ articles about entrepreneurs who gambled it all, and the stories make for great movie plots. But it’s no longer really necessary. In most cases, you can test an idea – a business, a lifestyle, a book – for a small amount of money with a small amount of risk. If you start with small bets, you can test your assumptions before there’s any real risk to you. And if you do go a few steps further – quit your job, sell your house, etc. – remember that you can (almost) always come back from it.

Experimenting with ideal lifestyle design should be a liberating experience, not one that makes you feel trapped to the singular path in front of you. Embrace the experimentation. Know that you can always come back.

[_Beyond the Picket Fence_](https://publishizer.com/beyond-the-picket-fence/) is due for release March 31st, 2015.
