A couple weeks back, Seth wrote a post called, [_We Can’t Talk About It_](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/11/we-cant-talk-about-it.html)_._ Here it is verbatim:

### [We can’t talk about it](http://feeds.feedblitz.com/~/79880453/0/sethsblog~We-cant-talk-about-it.html)

We can’t talk about how we could do things better around here

We can’t talk about what isn’t working

We can’t talk about the countless opportunities we ignore

We can’t talk about what hurts

We can’t talk about dignity

We can’t talk about how to make magic happen

We can’t talk to our boss, our employees, our board, our investors

We can’t talk about the things we can’t talk about

That’s a shame.

It **is** a shame. And here’s the thing – **We can talk about it.** Every day I get the opportunity to connect with team leaders who are working up the courage to talk about it. [Consultants](www.actionablebooks.com/consultants) who are helping them talk about it. I can tell you from personal experience, these are the best, most rewarding and most engrossing conversations you can have in the workplace. So maybe it’s time to have some of your own.

**January is a powerful month.** Most people are in the headspace of wanting to do better. Wanting to **be** better. Most people are looking for someone to take the lead. What if you started a meaningful conversation this week? What if you grabbed one of the [free summaries](www.actionablebooks.com/summaries) or recent [podcast episodes](https://www.actionablebooks.com/podcast), scheduled an open chat for one of the lunch hours later this week, and invited a dozen people to participate? **What’s the worst that could happen?**

Most people are open to trying new things in January, particularly things that they believe might lead to creating a better version of themselves. Maybe you can tap into that.

[_Actionable Workshops_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/workshops) _was designed as a tool exclusively to start the conversations about what’s broken and what gets us out of bed in the morning. Conversations about the things that matter. If you want to build regular conversation into your workplace, you may want to check it out._
