Ad man turned brand coach, Ted Matthews is on a mission to help companies large and small (re)connect with the idea that “Brand” is NOT the logo. It’s what people think of you.

**2:05** The number one rule of branding  
**4:20** The role of the entrepreneur in branding  
**5:00** The problem with business schools when it comes to branding  
**8:10** The “risk” of focusing on a hyper-narrow market  
**10:10** Who’s the “CBO” at your company?  
**10:58** Why “Fresh” is better than “New”  
**11:53** Focus on Evolution, not Revolution  
**14:50** Where the brand responsibility REALLY lies  
**17:25** Why Brand is crucial to recruiting the next generation
