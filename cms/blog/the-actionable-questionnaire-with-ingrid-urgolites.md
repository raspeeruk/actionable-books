[Ingrid Urgolites](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/team/ingrid-urgolites/) is a voracious reader of business books and a member of the Actionable Book Club since January. We decided to catch up with this Actionable Book Club member to learn more about her passion for books.

**What’s your all-time favourite book?**  
There are so many to choose from, but one that stands out in my mind is _Lincoln the Unknown_ by Dale Carnegie. It is a short biography of Lincoln. Dale Carnegie also wrote the classic [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-the-digital-age/). He is not a historian, but the book is well researched. This is a treatise on Lincoln’s personal qualities rather than a precise historic account. I think it’s Lincoln’s personal qualities Carnegie tries to formulate in [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-the-digital-age/).

The beauty of it is you get to sit back and relax as you enjoy this marvelous story of the life of a great person and just admire him with the author. There is no need to take notes or plan actions. Rapt attention, captivation, and awestruck admiration are all that is required here.

**Has a book ever changed your life? If so, tell us about it…**  
When I was in about second grade, my class went to the school library to borrow books once a week. I told the teacher I didn’t want to read any of them because they were boring. He asked me to read _Where the Sidewalk Ends_ by Shel Silverstein. I had read it several times by the end of the week when I had to return it. I still read it today. It is not boring–it is creative and playful poetry. If you are seven or eight, it also has some practical ideas. It changed my life because I decided to believe all books are worth reconsidering. Many of the books I have read since then have shaped my life in countless ways. Books and reading are an invaluable resource.

**Do you read books outside of the business/professional development genre?**  
Most of the books I read are in the business and professional development genre, but I do have other interests.

I read books that relate to my hobbies. I enjoy cooking, and I read cookbooks cover to cover to get ideas. I do the same with design and craft books. They are full of raw material I use to shape new projects.

I enjoy reading nonfiction for information on a variety interesting subjects. I especially like to read science and scientific theory, particularly astronomy. I am also interested in health, but I read very few books on health because they tend to focus on fads. Academic publications are a better source of information.

I like to find old and new odd books to read for entertainment. I have one called _The Art of Kissing_ by Pietro Ramirez. Among other gems, it includes a chapter on “Electric Kissing Parties” but suggests you do not use your house wiring because the current is too strong. It was published in 1936, and the author is very serious with his suggestions. The old ideas juxtaposed against modern times are anything but serious. The beauty of these books is I never know what I will find.

Occasionally I read fiction but I mostly stick to literature, classic children’s books and poetry by authors I already like. I read it just to enjoy the words and rethink the ideas.

**Kindle or traditional paper books… which do you prefer?**  
Paper softcover because I think it is more practical than investing in a hardcover unless it is a special book. I love my Kindle but I spend too much time staring at a screen, and when I have the choice, I give my eyes a break.

**Tell us about your reading routine. (i.e. Time of day, favourite spot, snack, drink…)**  
I read when I have the opportunity. Right now, I start work at 6:00 am and sometimes it takes me an hour to get there. I don’t have much time to read in the morning. In the middle of the day, I take a break and a walk or workout, follow-up on personal stuff and plan for the second half of the day. Sometimes I have time to read but it is usually short articles or blogs maybe the _Washington Post_ or _Mad Magazine_ depending on how things are going. In the evening, I do some stretching and settle down. I like reading books or writing in the evening because it focuses my mind on something other than my daily activities. I find it refreshing and feel like it is a reward at the end of the day. I like sipping herbal tea. If I am too tired, I do something that takes less mental energy like needlepoint. Days off are a great time to get into books because I can set aside a block of time and concentrate on the ideas.

**We’re all about action. How have you implemented an idea from one of the books you’ve summarized and how has it helped to transform your life?**  
Each month it’s hard to pare down the ideas in these wonderful books and focus on a couple. It’s even harder to say which one has made the most difference. I will go with my The Big Idea for [_Selling the Invisible_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/selling-the-invisible/) by Harry Beckwith. The idea’s essence is to keep communicating. I’ve always been pretty good about asking people what they want from the beginning. I have not been good about subsequent follow-ups to be sure they are still getting what they need and making adjustments if necessary. Remembering to maintain connections has helped not just with clients but also all other relationships. I don’t know what other people think, want, or need, and I do know needs change. When I don’t ask, I am acting on my thoughts and experiences that may not be in line with theirs. It seems like just letting people know that I want to know what they want makes a difference.

**Finally, what are you reading at the moment?**  
_Decide_ by Steve McClatchy for my next summary. I’m getting ready to write about it. I usually focus on one book at a time unless they are different genres to avoid confusing the ideas. I just finished a little book by Michael White called _Coffee with Isaac Newton_. It’s an imaginary but illuminating biographical interview. White also wrote _Isaac Newton: The Last Sorcerer_, a comprehensive biography that I enjoyed reading.
