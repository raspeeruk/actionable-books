**Justin Gasbarre** is a voracious reader of business books and one of our rock star members of the Actionable Book Club. We wanted to get to know Justin a little better through his passion for reading.

**_What’s your all-time favourite book?_**I have two favorite books – they are [_Outliers_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/outliers/) by Malcolm Gladwell and [_The Slight Edge_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-slight-edge/) by Jeff Olson!

**_Has a book ever changed your life? If so, tell us about it…_**Yes and that’s a loaded question for me. I think every book I read changes me in some way. Whether I notice it in the moment or not is another story, but I am a firm believer in learning, education and that reading changes a person’s perspectives and paradigms in business, relationships, sales and life and most times it’s a gradual, evolutionary change.

**_Do you read books outside of the business/professional development genre?_**I do. I am a huge sports fan so I love books, biographies and autobiographies about athletes, coaches, and sports teams! I also recently read _The Martian_ by Andy Weir which was my first sci-fi book. It’s awesome, check it out!

**_Kindle or traditional paper books… which do you prefer?_**Paper books all the way!

**_Tell us about your reading routine. (i.e. Time of day, favourite spot, snack, drink…)_**I usually read first thing in the morning! I view reading just as I view working out, I like to do it early so that no matter what else happens throughout the day at least I got my reading in. I typically read at my desk in my home office.

**_We’re all about action. How have you implemented an idea from one of the books you’ve summarized and how has it helped to transform your life?_**I would say the book that has impacted me the most over the last few months was from Tim Grover’s book [_Relentless_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/relentless/). What I took from it was to only compete with yourself; to have the discipline and focus to not worry about what others are doing and focus on what you can control and compete against your own potential!

**_Finally, what are you reading at the moment?_**I am currently reading _Ageless Entrepreneur_ by Fred Dawkins–keep an eye out as it’s my next summary!–and I am also reading [_Never Eat Alone_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/never-eat-alone/) by Keith Ferrazzi.
