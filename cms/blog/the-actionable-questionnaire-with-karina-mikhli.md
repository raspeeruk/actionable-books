_The members of our Actionable Book Club are voracious readers. In the first installment of The Actionable Questionnaire, we sit down with ABC member_ **_Karina Mikhli_** _to discuss her reading habits and how books have transformed her life._

**What’s your all-time favourite book?  
**That’s a really tough question and I actually have a “favorites” list in GoodReads where I track all my favorites. But for business books, the one that jumps to mind is _First Break All the Rules: What the World’s Best Managers Do Differently_ by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Hoffman. It’s what changed my perception of management and where one should focus one’s efforts on–strengths rather than weaknesses. I’ve read every book by Marcus Buckingham since, including his most recent _Standout 2.0._

**Has a book ever changed your life? If so, tell us about it…  
**Absolutely. _First Break All the Rules_ taught me to focus on my strengths and what good management is about (mentioned in first answer) and [_Body of Work_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/body-of-work/) by Pamela Slim helped me come to terms with the trouble I’ve been having with my career. I had owned it for a while and didn’t pick it up until a bad week where I felt like I bled for two recruiters in a row, explaining all the layoffs, reorgs, and reasons behind all my job hopping. I was feeling depressed, miserable, hopeless…and then I read this book and it made me realize that I needed to reframe all my positions, both for myself and for the recruiters, to show how they were all leading to a larger body of work that I was working towards. I am not doing the book or its message justice but highly recommend it for anyone who’s trying to find themselves, career-wise or otherwise.

**Do you read books outside of the business/professional development genre?  
**Yes. Believe it or not, up until three years ago, I hated all non-fiction. I joined the Women’s Business and Leadership Book Club via Meetup (which I now run) to be forced to read business books. For a while I was alternating fiction and business, and then found I read more business books when not happy at work. Now I read mainly business books with an occasional fiction thrown in when I need something different.

When I am reading fiction, nowadays it tends to be fantasy, whether adult or YA (young adult). I used to read contemporary and historical fiction and women’s fiction, but lately haven’t really had interest in much else but a magically woven fantasy world with great characters, plot, and momentum. I guess I want something that’s removed from reality but also a really compelling story that won’t let go until it’s over, and not even then. Like anything by Charles de Lint, Anne Bishop, and Juliet Marillier to just name three of my favorite fantasy authors.

**Kindle or traditional paper books… which do you prefer?  
**Definitely traditional. I’m Sabbath observant so can’t read electronically on the Sabbath, when I do much of my reading. I own a Nook and occasionally will buy an e-book if that’s all that’s available or if the hardcover is too big to carry around, but I still buy the hardcover and just read from it when home.

**Tell us about your reading routine. (i.e. Time of day, favourite spot, snack, drink…)  
**My favorite time to read is always and I wish I had more time to read. That said, when I commute to the city, I read as long as I have a seat. Otherwise I try to squeeze some reading in somewhere in the evening and then spend most of Friday night and all Saturday reading. I also read on my Spin bike when it’s raining and I can’t take a walk…and occasionally even if I can take a walk if I haven’t gotten enough reading in.

I don’t tend to eat or drink when reading and I have this large, soft recliner in my living room that my two boys (husband and son) know is mine when I want it. It’s perfect for reading and napping in between too.

**We’re all about action. How have you implemented an idea from one of the books you’ve summarized and how has it helped to transform your life?  
**I can’t think of one exact takeaway but I do know that everything I read has made me more aware and that writing has deepened my learning and awareness, as I wrote in my blog :).

I did really like [_Procrastinate on Purpose_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/procrastinate-on-purpose/) since it made me realize that it’s not only about being efficient, but being effective too: you first have to figure out the right time for the right thing and then can focus on doing it better. I’ve been trying to be smarter about both and it’s a work in progress 

**Finally, what are you reading at the moment?  
**I actually just finished reading _Uprooted_ by Naomi Novik, a wonderful fantasy that I recommend, and am about to start _The Politics of Promotion_ by Bonnie Marcus, my next ABC book. I read [_Penguins Can’t Fly +39 Other Rules That Don’t Exist_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/penguins-cant-fly-39-other-rules-that-dont-exist/) over the weekend. We had discussed it during our last ABC call and I’m really glad I read it for myself.
