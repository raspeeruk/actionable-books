I have a question for you. Around 15:30 of my [interview with Patrick Lencioni](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/patrick-lencioni-the-value-of-vulnerability/), Pat dives into a discussion of how strong leaders are a comfortable balance of ego and humility. Easier said, than done, he’s quick to admit, but an important balance to strike none-the-less. My question was around entrepreneurs – people who have had to battle the ney-sayers to accomplish what they have, but now have a team that they need to lead with humility. How do you make that shift? Lencioni has his thoughts, but I’d like to hear from you.

Where do YOU think that balance can come from?
