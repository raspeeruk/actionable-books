There’s certain pieces of advice that just stick with you. For me, one that resonates over and over is from Steven Pressfield (I think it was from [Turning Pro](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/turning-pro/)). And it’s this (loosely paraphrased):

“The difference between being an amateur and a professional is that professionals do the work _even when they don’t feel like it_.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We all have bad days. Low energy days. Days where we feel more like doing, well, _anything_ other than the work we know we should be doing. And it’s so easy to justify putting it off, isn’t it? Everyone else does it. But being a professional isn’t about being like everyone else. Nor is being a professional a designation, a title or a right. It’s simply a matter of making the choice to push through the procrastination. and deliver.

**What are you choosing to do today?**
