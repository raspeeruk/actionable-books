Full disclosure: here at Actionable, we are super fans of Michael Bungay Stanier. In 2012, Actionable Founder Chris Taylor sat down with Michael to talk about how to [_Do More Great Work_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/blog/michael-bungay-stanier-doing-great-work/). Since then, we’ve written summaries of [_Do More Great Work_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/do-more-great-work), [_Get Unstuck & Get Going_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/get-unstuck-get-going), and [_The Coaching Habit_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-coaching-habit/), and hosted Michael for a [webinar about _The Coaching Habit_](https://actionable.co/thoughts/2016/09/coaching-mindset-webinar-replay/).

One of the things we love about Michael’s work is that it’s highly actionable—_Do More Great Work_, for example, is an inspiring read that will change the way you think about work. The book goes one step further than mere inspiration—it provides a blueprint for how to turn that [inspiration into action](https://actionable.co/thoughts/2017/03/inspiration-fine-action-better/) (which is essential to get results). Michael’s work embodies the Actionable ethos, that ideas are only valuable when applied—and his books provide a clear path to engage with, and apply, his insights.

Michael’s latest book, [_The Coaching Habit_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-coaching-habit/), is celebrating its one-year anniversary—a full year of dominating the Amazon charts (the #1 coaching book since its release), and inspiring busy leaders and managers to adopt a coaching mindset with their teams. _The Coaching Habit_ was a winner in the [10th annual National Indie Excellence Awards](http://indieexcellence.com/indie-results-10th-winners.htm) in the Business – General category, and was also named a [Shelf Unbound Notable 100 Winner](http://www.shelfmediagroup.com/pages/contest-winners.html).

_The Coaching Habit_ is an excellent resource for leaders who are just learning how to coach their teams. It provides a set of questions that anyone can use in their next meeting to step back from trying to provide the answers, and encourage their teams to think for themselves.

For so many leaders, it seems faster and easier to simply provide advice and move on. When a team member asks for help, we want to give them the answers—it feels great to be right! But when we indulge those instincts, we lose out on an opportunity to help our teams in the long term. These questions are a great defense against the advice monster.

The Seven Essential Coaching Questions:

1.  The Kickstart Question: “What’s on your mind?”
2.  The AWE Question: “And what else?”
3.  The Focus Question: “What’s the real challenge here for you?”
4.  The Foundation Question: “What do you want?”
5.  The Lazy Question: “How can I help?”
6.  The Strategic Question: “If you’re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?”
7.  The Learning Question: “What was most useful to you about this conversation?”

Coaching continues to be a hot topic in the business world—it’s a useful tool for nurturing high performers, and creating the type of relationships that make work meaningful for leaders and their teams. As teams continue to struggle with low engagement, [adopting a coaching mindset](https://consultants.actionable.co/thoughts/2016/12/im-mean-coach/) is a great tool for leaders to connect with their teams, and get results.

Please join us in congratulating Michael Bungay Stanier and the crew at [Box of Crayons](http://www.boxofcrayons.biz/) as they celebrate this exciting milestone!
