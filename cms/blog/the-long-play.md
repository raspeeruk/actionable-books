It would seem that our view of things is becoming more and more myopic by the day.

CEOs and shareholders are more and more focused on quarterly earnings.

Sales people are more focused on hitting monthly targets.

We’re more focused on how we’ll get through this day, sometimes even this hour, than we are on the long term impact of our role and work.

**And yet**. And yet when we take a brief pause – a moment to reflect on where we’re going and why – we enter our tasks with more deliberate purpose. We can make clearer decisions – decisions that align with our values and long term objectives. Our conversations become more values driven than quota driven. We treat people better and build better reputations for ourselves in the process.

When we focus on the long play, rather than responding solely to what faces us this instant, we bring confidence and calm to our roles. Grace, even.

In a world that’s more focused on the next 10 minutes than the next 10 years, those who do work for the long term stand out as stoic boulders amongst the swirling rapids of busyness.

**Are you deliberately paddling towards a specific island, or are you simply treading water?**
