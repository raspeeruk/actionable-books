**“What do you want to have happen?”**

That one question – raised to me by Seth Godin years back – continues to be the most powerful seven words I have in business. For myself, my team, our clients and coaches, no matter what the challenge is, the very first question I ask is **what do you want to have happen?**

It’s usually a pretty short conversation after that one’s answered.

How often do we overcomplicate and overthink the problems that we face? We think too micro or too macro. We worry through all the small details, all the “what if’s?” and what people might think. We spend far too much time exploring the details **surrounding** the issue; so much so that we can miss the solution we already have.

Figure out where you’re going, and the path to get there becomes a lot more obvious.
