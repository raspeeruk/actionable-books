I had a conversation with a good friend the other day about “going out on his own”. He’s a sharp guy, knows his industry well and has a solid financial base built up around him. You can tell he’s aching to do it but, as he says, he will when “the timing is right”. Fair enough. Who am I to tell him when the right time is? But it got me thinking…

No question, there are ebbs and flows to life – to business – that a wise person listens to. There are times best suited to maintaining, times for launching, and times for saying “not yet”. I’m all for intelligently casting a look to the horizon, and planning accordingly. **So long as the search for the “right timing” isn’t actually a naive attempt to wait for the perfect timing.**

Perfect timing – that magical hour when the stars align and everything falls into place – doesn’t exist.

There will always be a reason not to move forward… what we need to be vigilantly watching for (and embracing) are all the excuses to take the plunge anyway.

Or, the way I look at it, it’s kind of like jumping into a cold lake. The more you think about it – the more you dip your toe in – the harder it is to actually jump. Make sure there’s a way out of the water – if that’s important to you – but then don’t over think it. Just jump. You’re a talented person. You’ll figure it out.
