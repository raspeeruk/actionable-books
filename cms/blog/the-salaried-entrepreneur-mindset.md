About 4 years ago, on the heels of a series of interviews with top business book authors, I started throwing around the term “Salaried Entrepreneur”. The concept was simple – entrepreneurship is a _mindset_, not a compensation structure.

The idea of challenging the unknown; building and creating in service to a particular market is **universally** beneficial. I think Gen-Y instinctively gets this. The generation’s resistance to the status quo, and driving desire for a deeper purpose in everything they do is core to the genetic makeup of an entrepreneur.

Our two showcase summaries this week – [Personality Not Included](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/personality-not-included/) and [Promote Yourself](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/promote-yourself/) – address this “Salaried Entrepreneur” concept from different, yet equally important angles, which coalesce in one simple yet powerful thought:

Companies thrive when they work towards the best interest (nay, the **passions**) of their target market, and the individuals who drive those (often daring) initiatives need to be recognized for their efforts.

**Which part do you want to focus on this week – connecting with the passions of your customers, or recognizing people for doing something daring?**
