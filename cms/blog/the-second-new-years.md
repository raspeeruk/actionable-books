To me, September 1 is sort of like the second New Years. The summer is over, we’re barreling into another 8 months of productivity and creation. For most of us, September – May is when the work is truly done. That in mind, what are you working towards over the next 8 months? What will you create, and what impact will you leave on your customers, your company, your community?

I asked what you’re working **towards**, not what you’re working **on**. Avoid getting caught in the weeds of “doing”, by consistently and regularly poking your head up to reconnect with where you’re going. Not only will it keep you focused, it will keep you invigorated. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.
