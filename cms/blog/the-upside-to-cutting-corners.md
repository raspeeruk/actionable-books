is limited. Truly.

How much time can you actually “shave off” by putting a little less into it? How much money can you really save by doing “not-quite-a-full-Quality-Assurance-inspection”? The challenge with cutting corners is that it breeds mediocrity. If we’re not pursuing greatness, we’re subscribing to “standard”. I don’t know if you’ve been online or in the stores lately, but we’re good on mediocrity. All stocked up.

What about going the other way? What if, instead of thinking “how little could I do on this and still get by?” you went with “how much more could I put into this, and what could I create?”

While the upside of cutting corners – of going **inwards** – is finite, the potential when you go **outwards** creating value, is virtually limitless. Looking for opportunities to **maximize** your impact, rather than **minimize your effort** garners you reputation, contacts, client and success. It even comes with it’s own feeling.

When we’re overwhelmed by options (37 varieties of toothpaste, anyone?), we go with the products and services that delight us; the ones where we know the makers relished the creation experience and took pride in producing it to the best of their abilities. We feel good buying from these people. We walk away with more than a product.

Wouldn’t you like to create that feeling in your customers?
