For many, reading _To Kill a Mockingbird_ in high school was a rite of passage. It’s a book that’s as relevant and profound as it was when it was first published 56 years ago_—_arguably even more so. Its pages are imbued with enduring life lessons of compassion and how we should treat our fellow man, a true actionable book if there ever was one.

Its author, the famously reclusive Harper Lee, died last week at the age of 89. We want to remember her through her words with a handful of inspiring and influential quotes from her groundbreaking novel.

_“You can’t really get to know a person until you get in their shoes and walk around in them.”_

_“Simply because we were licked a hundred years before we started is no reason for us not to try to win.”_

_“Until I feared I would lose it, I never loved to read. One does not love breathing.”_

_“We’re paying the highest tribute you can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It’s that simple.”_
