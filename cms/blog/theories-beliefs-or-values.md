In the intro of Richard Branson’s _Business Stripped Bare_, the celebrated entrepreneur says, “I haven’t peddled any theories, because I don’t follow any” (Business Stripped Bare, page xiii).

Which begs the question – what does he follow in conducting his business?  
What do you?

The way I see it, you can choose to conduct yourself professionally following one of three paths:

**Theories** – truths according to someone else (typically an expert or someone you hold in high regard)  
**Beliefs** – truths according to your collective experiences  
**Values** – truths according to how you’d like to see the world

Each one influences the others, of course, but chances are you have a dominant source that colours your view of how business should be conducted. Branson works to the value that “business should be fun”; and it drives everything he does.

Are you working do theories, beliefs, or values? Do you know? And what are they?
