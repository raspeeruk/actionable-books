It can’t be done. You can’t “teach” someone to be creative, just like you can’t teach someone how to love. There is no guidebook, no fixed set of steps.

We don’t teach creativity, we foster it. We encourage it and support it by allowing it to blossom in a safe environment. How? Two steps:

**1\. Create the environment.** Set the rules, invite the right people, share the intention. (No judgement)  
**2\. Ask questions.** Creativity shines when it’s tapped to solve interesting problems. Be a leader by providing questions, not answers.

The same holds true whether you’re a parent, a boss, a friend or a classmate. Creativity comes when we create the right conditions.
