My friend Michael is hosting a truly cool, truly unique [**Great Work MBA**](http://www.greatworkmba.com) next week. 25 thought leaders (including Chris Brogan, Nilofer Merchant, Sally Hogshead, Brené Brown) discussing **Great Work** (as opposed to **Bad Work**, or the far more insidious **Good Work**); providing a multitude of tips and action plans for making work more enjoyable, more productive and more fulfilling.

It’s a fabulous program, it’s free (_next week only_), and I’m delighted to be playing a small part in it.

One of the perks of being involved is I get to watch the discussions ahead of time. I’m about 20% of the way through, and loving every minute of it. The biggest takeaway I’ve gained from these highly successful (and highly **happy**, I would suspect) individuals is that **nothing changes until you do**. Those who realize great success _do something to drive that success._ They start. They don’t wait until it’s perfect. They don’t wait until they can’t fail. They simply jump in.

Over the past 5 years with Actionable, we’ve tried lots of things. Some have gone exactly as planned. Some have been statistical failures. And yet, even with the failures, **every single initiative launched** – everything actually pushed into the world – **has generated value that outweighed the cost of launching.** We’ve learned something that’s set us in a new direction. We’ve met people that have later provided real value, either through endorsement or actual dollars.

I believe that if you’re trying something new that (a) aligns with your values, (b) works towards a purpose that lights you up inside, and that you (c) spend at least a little time mitigating the risk, you’re going to wind up better than you were before. Because, to put a slight spin on it, “nothing changes until you **Do**“.

I recommend you check out Michael’s free program next week ([register this week](http://www.greatworkmba.com)). Use the myriad of talks as the push to start something. The push to **Do**.

_And, if you’re coach, consultant or facilitator, you may also want to check out our_ [_Actionable Consultant Program_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants) _(ACP). It’s full of people who believe that work can be an enriching, enjoyable experience… and they’re doing something about it._ [**Applications are now open**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/consultants).
