Listening to Jennifer Reil, from Rotman University. She shares a fascinating story about A.G. Lafley, former CEO of packaged good giant, Procter & Gamble.

Apparently, Lafley had a rule in his meetings: any time that everyone **agreed** with a particular option very quickly, he would **delay** making a decision. Instead, he would seek out someone who disagreed with the consensus and bring them into the discussion.

Lafley believed, as many great leaders believe, that there is no Absolute Right answer to a business problem. Much better to get a few potential options and try to build something magnificent than to settle for the first consensus. Push for opposition; itâ€™s in those lively debates that greatness happens.
