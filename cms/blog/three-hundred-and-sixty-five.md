**Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, children of all ages, welcome to the SHOW!**

Your show. 365 days that together equal a glorious year of possibility.

### 2013 is **your** year.

Why? Because you choose to make it so. You choose to stay focused. To complete (with excellence) the small, incremental steps that will culminate in daring projects. In experiments derived of curiosity and passion. In realizing never-before-experienced levels of growth and accomplishment.

You choose to commit. To get out of bed when the alarm goes off, and to spend your days living big. To acknowledging the voice inside your head that says it’s all too risky; that it’s better to stay in bed and play small. You acknowledge that voice and politely ignore it. You make this year everything you dreamed it could be.

You make the choice. You commit to the decision. You are in control. You’re ready.

**Let’s go.**
