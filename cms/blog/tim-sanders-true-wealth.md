In 2008 Tim Sanders began work on _Today We Are Rich_. He recognized that much of the world was gripped with a fear of poverty. Initially this fear was on a business level, but quickly became on a personal level. He learned that the secret to confidence is generosity. When you have faith, you will share–becoming truly rich. When you don’t, you hoard.
