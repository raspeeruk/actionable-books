I had the pleasure of listening to General Rick Hillier, of the Canadian Armed Forces, speak today. Not only was he engaging and hilarious, he had some brilliant insights to share on leadership.

Which is a great reminder. Just because someone doesn’t have an MBA from Harvard doesn’t mean they don’t know a thing or two. Hillier’s leadership strength, I believe, comes from his humility and willingness to find lessons in the most unusual of places.

In fact, Hillier went so far to say that 70% of everything he knows about leadership, he learned from **bad** leaders. He learned to not discredit what you can learn from someone just because it doesn’t jive with what you believe to be right.

We could all do with being a little more open to our sources of teaching and inspiration. Something to think about.
