If you press the mute button and watch the American presidential primary debates, it is striking how miserable each candidate looks. Give it a try. Watch all the candidates’ non-verbal signals closely. You will notice that scowling and frowning is in. Smiles appear forced, and genuine laughter is in short supply. Finger pointing and tightening of the shoulders—as if ready to face off a saber tooth tiger—is relatively common. Research has made it clear that those expressions and postures actually impact our overall mindset and mood. It makes one wonder what kind of mood the candidates are in when the camera is not turned on.

In any case, watching the nonverbal behavior, it does NOT seem as though the candidates are enjoying the process. And these are all people who chose to be in politics.

That brings us to a much-discussed issue: How do we find ways to both enjoy and create meaning in our work and in our lives? To be sure, these candidates are under pressure to perform. So what specific things can we do to stay in touch with the things that matter to us as individuals and find joy in the pursuit of our goals—even when under pressure? In other words, how can we stay true to ourselves and actually be authentic?

Becoming more authentic is one piece of the puzzle of living a meaningful life. The concept of authenticity is one of the noblest of all human pursuits. It has roots in philosophy and literature. We have all heard Shakespeare’s “to thine own self be true,” and we know that the ancient Greeks told us to know ourselves. Becoming an authentic person is something that we all aspire to. It is difficult to argue in theory. We know that we are all in a more productive mindset when we are being true to ourselves. But the practice of being authentic is more challenging than the discussion of the concept, especially when the pressure hits. So, what to do when the heat is on:

Do something that you truly enjoy every day even if it is just for a brief period of time. I remember videos of President Obama, then candidate Obama, playing basketball on the campaign trail. He seemed to be enjoying himself. The idea of basketball without a remote and a television makes me tired. But give me a tennis racquet and I am a happy camper. What specific thing makes you happy? It does not have to be exercise. One of my clients reads uninterrupted for 30 minutes every day. Another sneaks out of her high-pressure office in the middle of the day and works in her garden for 30 minutes. Figure out what works for you and do it today.

Do something nice for someone else. It does not have to be a big deal. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt and others have clarified the effect of what he calls moral elevation. Elevation is a positive mindset in which you can see possibility, be more creative, and think more broadly. Think of the state of elevation as a virtue buzz.

Being good can feel good, but here’s the trick: You have to pause long enough to notice the state of elevation in your own head. Positive emotions are more subtle than negative emotions. Here is an example. One of my clients routinely leaves his desk for a second cup of coffee around 9:30 am every day. I encouraged him to pick up a second Starbucks for a colleague every day for a week and surprise them. Such an action wouldn’t require much extra time or expense. Five days. Five colleagues. Five states of elevation for him. He was unprepared for the intensity of his colleagues’ reactions and gratitude. One woman became tearful and said _you have no idea how much this means_! Give it a try.

Experiment with some kind of mindfulness practice for three days. The research on mindfulness and well-being is becoming overwhelming. I know that your inner saboteur is telling you that meditating is for people who have less to do, or for people who wear big flowing robes. One of my clients said to me recently, “I can’t cross my legs.” He was serious. I said okay, can you breathe?

The options are endless. If you look at the app store on either an Apple or Android device, you will see many options. Here is my challenge to you. Download one of those apps and try it for three days. But use it at the same time every day. I have clients, colleagues, and friends who practice in the evening or in the middle of the day. For me, it has to be the first thing I do after procuring a caffeine source or else it doesn’t happen.

The last thing we are inclined to do when under pressure is take time out to do something nice for someone else or that we enjoy. The activities seem frivolous. And taking time out to practice mindfulness, are you kidding? However, fight your nature and your inner saboteur and give one of these experiments a try in your own life. You just might discover a better version of yourself under pressure.
