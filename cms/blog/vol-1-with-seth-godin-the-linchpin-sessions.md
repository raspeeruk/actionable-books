On November 19th, 2009 Actionable Books Founder Chris Taylor sat down with best selling author and marketing guru Seth Godin. They spoke about Seth’s new book (Linchpin), the education system, art, the primordial part of our brain that keeps us “safe” and the Canadian Exchange Rate.

“The Linchpin Session” is part 1 of a 12 part author interview series that took place throughout 2010.
