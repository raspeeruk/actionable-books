2011 promises to be a year of exciting growth for Actionable and [The Goose](http://gooseeducationalmedia.com). We’ve got some new author interviews lined up, great new features being added to both the free and paid elements of the site and a couple other goodies. For me, though, no aspect of growth is as exciting or fulfilling as bringing on a new team member. Which is why, it delights me to introduce Andy Budgell who, effective immediately, is stepping in as our Community Manager. Andy brings with him a great passion for our content, and the online community at large. Feel free to drop him a line and make him feel welcome ([andy at actionablebooks dot com](mailto:andy@actionablebooks.com))

After dedicating two fantastic years to the company and our mission of turning business books into accessible, actionable tools for leaders and individuals alike, Lindsay Calder – who many of you know as the tireless voice behind any personal interactions you’ve had with the company (through [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/actionablebooks), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/actionablebooks), [ActionableLiterac](http://actionableliteracy.com)y, etc) – has decided to take a step back from the day to day responsibilities of the business. I want to take a moment to publicly thank Lindsay for the hard work, dedication and tremendous spirit she has brought to the organization during her time with us. I can safely say that we wouldn’t have had the success we’ve had over the past 2 years if it hadn’t been for her involvement.

So, the team is growing and adapting. The people involved are pursuing their passions and **nothing** for me is more exciting than that.

Welcome, Andy. Best wishes, Lindsay.

Here we go.
