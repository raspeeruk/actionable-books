It’s an exciting time at Actionable. Since bringing on my business partner, Will, a little over a year ago, we’ve been swiftly positioning the brand (and it’s various tools for improving the world of work) to be a global player in the Learning and Development space.

A couple of the highlights:

*   We’re on the very precipice of launching a rebuilt, re-envisioned and more powerful version of Actionable Workshops (under the improved and infinitely more accurate moniker, _Actionable Conversations_)

*   A new branding project – unifying and adding clarity to the relationship between our various platforms – is underway (_wait – you didn’t know we even_ **_had_** _multiple platforms?_)

*   A wholly modernized version of ActionableBooks.com is slated for release later this year (_because we_ **_all_** _hate trying to read these summaries on a phone_)

*   **Aaaaaand,** [**we’re hiring**](https://actionable.workable.com/)**.** Love Actionable? Been checking out the summaries, podcasts and author conversations? Thinking about stepping up your involvement? **We should talk.**

We have four positions currently available, and will be adding a dozen or so more in the coming months. If you’re curious to see what types of roles we have, and – more importantly – what type of people we work with – check out [our fancy new careers page](https://actionable.workable.com/).

From past experience, our very best team members come from within this community. It’s not a company that makes sense for everyone, which means it might just be a fit for you.

Either way, thanks for being here. Your work matters.

Chris
