What’s driving you nuts right now? What are you dragging your heels on? What’s constantly on your To-Do list, yet never seems to get done (or started)?

Here’s the real question – **how did it get on your To-Do list in the first place?**

Was this delegated to you? Did you **volunteer** for it? I’m always amazed to see that many of the tasks that are weighing on me are things I signed up for. I **chose** to be subjected to this gnawing worry and sense of being behind. Which begs the question – did I do this intentionally? Am I masochistic in some way?

I think the answer comes down to **time**. When I signed up for something, there was no pressure. There was no looming deadline. There **was** a great new challenge – an opportunity to grow and develop; maybe create something new. It was only with the passage of time that that thing went from exciting to scary.

When you get into that type of situation, I think you need to make a decision – is this something that’s worth re-connecting with my original motivator (and pushing through), or is it something that needs to be dumped? And, if it does get dumped, I think it’s owed a period of serious reflection on how you can avoid over committing in the future. We’re all human – we all make mistakes and mis-judgments. Let’s just keep them to a minimum, shall we?
