Last Thursday in a dedicated email we announced the launch of our fall [**Business Builder Bootcamp**](https://actionablebooks.leadpages.net/bootcamp-n-america-november-promo/). 17 people unsubscribed from all future mailings. _Totally fine._ I’m a firm believer that most if not all digital relationships come to an end at some point, and if this dedicated email was a trigger to some that reminded them that they’re no longer in need of the services/content/community that they once found here at Actionable, I wish them all the best and hope they found value while they were here.

It got me thinking though, _what if they left because we were now charging for something?_ Granted, something new (not something they were used to getting for free), something specific to a subsection of our community (the Bootcamp is for sole-practitioners who categorize themselves as coaches, consultants or facilitators), and something that kicks off with a free session… but despite all that, what if they left because they didn’t like the idea of paying for something? In a digital age, when scale is a non-factor and information is everywhere, **what are we happy to pay for, and what do we expect to be free?** _(Some people expect everything to be_ _free, but let’s remove that group for a moment)._

What **should** we pay for? Here are my thoughts:

**1\. We’ll pay for Context.** When information is freely available, **time** becomes an incredibly valuable commodity. If someone that I trust can cut through the noise and give me access to resources/tools/information I need without me having to research and vet options, that’s valuable to me.

**2\. We’ll pay for Customization**. Again, building off the “information is everywhere” argument, but now I want to take it a step further; I want someone to understand me – my goals, current challenges and “unique” skill set and craft something specific to my needs. That’s even more valuable to me.

**3\. We’ll pay for Expertise**. Moving beyond simply giving me the tools (ie “Context” or “Customization”), I **definitely** value someone with greater skill set than me in some area doing the work for me. In fact, I value someone doing the work for me **so long as the time I save can be used to generate more money than what I spend on them doing it in the first place.** There’s two points in one here, but they both come down to the same principle – we buy back time by having someone else doing something that doesn’t rank high on our talent/interest scales.

**4\. We’ll pay for Access.** There’s a shift towards exclusivity taking place in the world today. We’ll pay more for “limited edition”, “application only” and exclusivity. When so much is available to all, the hard-to-get becomes more valuable.

**5\. We pay to Reward Ourselves.** We all work had. We want to reward ourselves from time to time, and the emotional draw of certain items/programs/products can definitely be alluring.

All of this is fairly rudimentary supply and demand economics, but it’s worthy of revisiting from time to time, I believe. When we pay for something, when we charge for something, I believe we’d do well to appreciate the **Why** of our transactions. As for Bootcamp, I believe we’re hitting #1, 2, 3 in a strong way, and even #4 **and** 5 to a certain degree for some people. Others will believe that we/you should give everything away for free. I encourage you to acknowledge, and politely dismiss those people. Bring value, and charge what makes sense for you and your clients. But that’s just my opinion, of course.
