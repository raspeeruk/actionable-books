Ready for a secret? _You’re going to be busy in 2014._ Fact.

How do I know this? **Because nature abhors a vacuum.** No matter what your plans, no matter what your circumstance, your days are going to become filled. I highly doubt any one of us is going to be standing around sometime later this year and thinking, “Ok, that’s everything on my To Do list checked off. I guess I should go find something else to do now.”

And yet some people will make 2014 exceptional; create something noteworthy, take their business to new heights, or lead their team to unprecedented performance levels. And some people will, well… muddle through. And the latter camp will complain about how they never have time to do the important work.

2014 is a year for [**doing great work**](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/do-more-great-work/)**.** But not by default. We need to resist the gravitational pull to the “pressing stuff”, and deliberately claw out time for the work that truly matters. The things we dream about when we imagine a shining success in 2014. None of this happens by accident. And none of it starts until you do. (Check out [_The Now_ _Habit_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-now-habit/), if you’re looking for tips on moving through procrastination.)

I love that New Years day falls on a Wednesday this year. That means that Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday will be quiet at the office, giving you a tiny little reprieve from the onslaught of “to dos”; a sliver of a window to carve out a plan or (better yet) a first step towards making 2014 your masterpiece. Seize it. No excuses. **This year’s only going to get busier.**
