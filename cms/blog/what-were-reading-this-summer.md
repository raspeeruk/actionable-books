Summer is a time for letting loose and having some fun, for finally taking that well deserved vacation you’ve been waiting all year for. But the summer downtime is also the perfect opportunity for us to turn to books for some inspiration. We’ve curated three inspiring reads that are set to be published this summer that we’re looking forward to delving into.

**That’s Not How We Do It Here!: A Story about How Organizations Rise and Fall–and Can Rise Again** by John Kotter and Holger Rathgeber

Has your amazing idea ever been met with the phrase _“That’s not how we do it here!”_? This highly anticipated book “distills Kotter’s decades of experience and award-winning research to reveal why organizations rise and fall, and how they can rise again in the face of adversity.” If you are one of many who enjoyed _Our Iceberg Is Melting,_ you won’t want to miss _That’s Not How We Do It Here_.

**Invisible Influence: The Hidden Forces That Shape Behavior** by Jonah Berger

Jonah Berger, the bestselling author of 2013’s [_Contagious: Why Things Catch On_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/contagious/), is back with a new book, _Invisible Influence_. Already topping the charts in its category on Amazon, this book promises to answer the elusive question of what exactly shapes our behaviour, “from what we buy, to the careers we choose, to what we eat.” And many of our favourite authors are already singing its praises, from Charles Duhigg ([_The Power of Habit_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-power-of-habit/)) to Amy Cuddy (_Presence_).

**Pivot: The Only Move That Matters Is Your Next One** by Jenny Blake

If you are finding yourself in the position of asking _“What’s next?”,_ Jenny Blake’s Pivot is for you. “Careers are not linear, predictable ladders any longer; they are fluid trajectories. No matter our age, life stage, bank account balance, or seniority, we are all being asked to navigate career changes much more frequently than in years past. The average employee tenure in America is just four to five years, and even those roles change dramatically within that time. Our economy now demands that we create businesses and careers based on creativity, growth, and impact. In this dynamic world of work, the only move that matters is your next one.”
