Digitally cut the following out of the latest issue of _Inc._ (really cool tool, for the record):

![What employees want](/assets/external/65d362449bbbce52fece25f6_what-employees-want.jpeg)

The stats were collected from HR departments and based on number of requests for the various incentives. A couple really interesting things here, as far as I’m concerned:

Only 45% of men have “more money” as their primary motivator. Which represents about 25% of the work world. So for the _other_ 75%, cash is nice but not necessarily your best way to retain and engage employees.

40% of millennials are looking for more training. Combine this with the 70 million (ish) North American Baby Boomers retiring in the next ten years and the fact that there are roughly 20 million mellennials/gen-Y coming to replace them, and you “suddenly” have an employee’s market, where the good ones have lots of options. the good ones want training. Give it to them and hopefully they’ll stick around a while longer.

**You weigh in** – do you agree with the stats shared? What are you seeing in the workplace?
