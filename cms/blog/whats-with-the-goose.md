The observant among us often ask me about the little teal Goose in the Actionable logo and scattered throughout the site. There’s a good chance you’ve noticed that the main point of each Actionable Summary is called a **The Big Idea**. But “The Goose”, to us, is far more than simply a vehicle for delivering you with The Big Ideas.

_Geese fly in a V formation. They do this so that every flap of their wings creates uplift for the one flying behind. In the V formation, the whole flock adds at least 71% more flying range than if each bird flew alone. Whenever a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag of flying alone and quickly returns to formation. Like geese, people who share a common direction and sense of community reach their goals faster and easier than those trying to go it alone._

I started Actionable Books as a place to house the insights I was gleaning from the business and personal development books I was reading – one per week for over two years. But the intention was never to create all the summaries myself. My hope was that someone in the community would choose to move from the passive consumption role into one of active production. Because, the secret is, you learn a tremendous amount more from _writing_ a summary than you do from reading one. Just ask any of the [68 talented people](https://www.actionablebooks.com/team/?filter=writer) who have picked up the mantle – flown to the front of the V – and contributed to the Actionable Summary collection.

Whether it’s here, with Actionable, or with any other group you’re a part of, I think it’s important to reflect every once in a while as to whether this time around you’re producing, or consuming. I actually don’t think there’s anything wrong with either, and I believe there’s a time and a place for each. But whatever you’re doing, be deliberate about it. Draw the line in the sand and commit.
