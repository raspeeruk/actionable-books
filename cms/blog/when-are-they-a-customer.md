**At what point do you stop trying to sell someone, and accept them as a “real customer”?**

I’ll explain:

*   I signed up for my very first gym membership a month ago. (Don’t judge. I’m going **now**, ok?)
*   I dropped $800 on the 12 month membership, then signed up for the personal trainer “starter pack” of 6, one-hour sessions. ($250)
*   On session three, 15 minutes (of my 60 minute session) was spent sitting at a desk, having package options explained to me. I said I’d consider them.
*   On session four, 15 minutes (of my 60 minute session) was spent sitting at a desk, revisiting the options. I said I likely wouldn’t be starting until the new year with more sessions.
*   On session five, 10 more minutes on the packages, this time a hard sell. (“I really think this is a good option”, he said) I told him I wouldn’t be buying until the new year, if at all.
*   On session six, 30 minutes (of my 60 minute session) was spent in agony at the desk while my trainer avoided eye-contact, continuing to tell me how I really needed a trainer, he didn’t believe I’d go on my own, and that I should buy the 100 session pack. I continually said I wasn’t interested. The remaining 30 minutes (where we actually worked out), was awkward to say the least and ended with my trainer saying “I’ll see you when I see you” and walking away, without so much as a smile or a handshake.

**Ok, rant over.** Here’s my point: **The gym already had $1000 of my money.** And at the end of the 6 sessions, instead of feeling inspired/proud/motivated/etc, I left feeling dejected. Like I’d done something wrong. Now, if the gym’s goal is to have only $5000+ a year clients, then I can sort of understand the behaviour (if only from a purely business perspective. Honestly, he was just rude.) But this is a big, national chain, and I have to believe that they’re happy with selling top tier memberships (I bought one of the highest memberships you can) and training packs. **But I don’t feel like a customer.** I feel like a mark.

Take a look at your own business. When are they welcomed in as a bonafide customer? Upselling is fine, but – my opinion only – if you’re going to offer a product or service, and **someone buys it**, show them the respect they deserve. Or they’ll go somewhere else. (Just as soon as their contract is over.)
