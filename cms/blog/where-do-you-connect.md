_Quick story for you���_

As I continue to reach out to interesting people in research for my [upcoming book](https://publishizer.com/beyond-the-picket-fence/), I came across Garrett Lisi – a beach bum who happens to also be a physicist working on some of the most complex mathematical equations in existence. I kid you not. **And**, believe it or not, Garrett is _not_ the topic of today’s post. Instead, his website is. Or, rather, the community that it introduced me to. Here’s the story:

I came across Garrett while watching a Science Television series called _Through the Wormhole_. (Seen it? It’s Morgan Freeman riffing on the nature of the universe. Awesome.) In any event, Garrett’s story was sufficiently interesting that Amy decided to do a little research and found a personal webpage at [http://sifter.org/~aglisi/](http://sifter.org/~aglisi/). Curious, I started investigating this “[Sifter.org](http://Sifter.org)“. I’d never heard of it. From their website, Sifter is described as:

_An international network of rational adventurers,  
creating, living, and sharing  
the good life._

Pretty cool right? I applied to join and, an hour or so later, walked through the (virtual) door to a (virtual) party of 400+ highly intelligent, decidedly impassioned individuals who value lifestyle and curiosity over social convention. I’m hooked.

**Ok, so what’s the point?**

This group exists. It’s niche, it’s out there, and it’s not for 99% of the world, and **that’s the point**. Whatever you’re into, whatever your beliefs, values or intentions, there’s a group out there for you. This is (sort of) the point from The Long Tail – there’s a market now for the most odd, bizarre and niche. There’s a market now for you. And it’s easier than ever to connect with those people.

We have our own band for the long tail – our [Actionable Book Club](www.actionablebooks.com/bookclub). Here’s what it’s all about:

[_Applications_](www.actionablebooks.com/bookclub) _are open until November 28th, 2014_

Book Club not for you? Cool, it’s not for most people. Again, that’s the point, right? Make something that’s for everyone and you water it down. Keep it niche – keep it making most people say, “No thanks” – and you make it special for a small group.

Find that group. The one that fits you, without compromise.
