_“Too many books, not enough time”_ is a common adage frequently uttered by any true book lover.

So, how do you sift through all of the junk out there and be more deliberate about your reading choices? A few years back I created a book bucket list. (Actually, if I’m being 100% honest, it’s just an Amazon wish list, but I find it ideal for this purpose. You can also do the same on GoodReads.) It’s filled with books that I plan to read over a lifetime for personal development. I actually don’t have just one list, but rather several, broken up and organized into genres and sub-genres: business books, biography, classic literature, etc. Creating your own book bucket list is much more personal and tailored to your own unique taste than those ready-made lists you see online, which are more of a jumping off point rather than something that should be strictly adhered to.

Creating your book bucket list is the fun—and easy!—part. However, actually reading the books on it is another matter altogether. Good luck!

Have you created a book bucket list? Has it made your reading more deliberate?
