I just started reading _Small Giants_, by Bo Burlingham. I already know I’m going to love it. Not only is Bo a terrific writer, but as an added bonus, he’s using this book as a platform to question the very motivators of business growth. He’s asking the question **Why?**

In the case of this book, he’s asking, “Why do we pursue geographic or market growth?” And it’s a great question, particularly for those of us who lead private companies and our answer doesn’t have to be, “to drive stakeholder value.”

But the root of question – the very nature of asking “Why?” is what intrigues me. It’s that question that drives virtually every discovery, every new theory and every invention that drives our society forward.

I recently followed filmmaker Brian Grazer on Twitter. His mini bio? _I make movies and TV shows but I’m curious about everything._

There’s a guy who understands the importance of Why. I think it’s paid off for him, too.
