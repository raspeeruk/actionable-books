In reading last week’s Actionable Summaries of [_The Charisma Myth_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-charisma-myth/) and [_Imagine_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/imagine/), I was reminded of something fairly powerful. We can do just about anything. We can get better at almost everything.

Think about it – charisma and creativity – two traits that can seem almost magical when realized, and in these two books we learned real ways to develop both. Sally Hogshead did it with [_Fascinate_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/fascinate/), too.

The question we need to consider is not _if_ we can improve at something, but _how_ to go about doing so. And, perhaps even more importantly, if it’s something we really want/need to focus on. We need to strip self pity and “I can’t do that” from our mindsets. We need to think intelligently about whether we really want to improve “that” in our lives… and then find the readily available resources to help us do it.
