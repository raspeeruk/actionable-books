“Remember, when riding a roller coaster, you have two choices: you can either hold on for dear life and scream, or you can wave your arms in the air and laugh. Either way, you’re still riding the roller coaster.”

_Double Double_, page 177

If you run a business or play a leadership role and **haven’t read** _Double Double_**_,_** by ex-1-800-GOT-JUNK COO, Cameron Herold, you owe it to yourself to do so. (We wrote a summary on it, which you can check out [here](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/double-double/).)

I wanted to focus on the quote above for a second though. In a world of a million job titles, you honestly have the ability to do exactly what you want to do. If your current role’s not making you happy, you can adapted it, ask for a change or, better yet, just go create the change. Which brings me to my point:

**You chose this role.** You chose the people you work with, the work you do, and the difference you make in the world. And if you don’t believe me, let me put it this way – by not choosing to move on, you effective chose to stay. So deal with it. Enjoy the ride or get off the ride. What’s the point in clinging to the safety bar with your eyes closed? You’ll miss the best parts! Sure, it’s scary. Sure, it feels like you might not make the next turn. but that’s the part worth living.

And, if you have no idea what I’m talking about, it is **definitely** time to find a new gig. But most of you do know **exactly** what I’m talking about. And that’s why we love ya. Have a great week.
