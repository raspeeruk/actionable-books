“_I can’t, I have to work._”

Very few things drain the spirit more than uttering those words. For two reasons –

**“have to”** suggests indentured servitude. No choice. No freedom.

**“work”** Opposite of play? Lacking fun or creativity? Synonyms include: _labor, toil, slog, drudgery, exertion, effort, industry, service._

In _The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_, Stephen Covey wrote about the power of shifting your language from “have to” to “choose to”, thereby owning your decisions.

So “I choose to go to work” becomes a positive reinforcement of intentional choice.

But what about _“work”_? I’ve found there’s power in more specifically articulating what you’re doing. ‘Work’ is too vague; too all encompassing. Instead of saying you’re working, see if one of these might be a more appropriate description:

*   Creating
*   Building
*   Refining
*   Maintaining
*   Managing
*   Communicating
*   Strategizing
*   Providing input
*   Mentoring
*   Coaching
*   Problem Solving

Don’t those sound like a lot more fun? And, as an added bonus, the very act of applying a more specific term clarifies the nature of the work you’re doing, making you more focused and engaged.

So no, you don’t (ever) “have to work”.
