Yes. You likely do. I do not. Nor do the people who start their opinions with, “**You know what you should do?**” And yet they attempt to ram their opinions down your throat, regardless. (Often without you even asking for their opinion… much less their directive.)

Here are some alternatives for “those people” to try out:

*   “You know what you could do…”
*   “Have you thought about…”
*   “I had a similar situation once, and here’s what I did…”
*   “I had a similar situation once, and here’s what I wish I’d done…”
*   “Have you thought about…”

Lots of options. All of them less “my-way-or-you’re-stupid”. Just saying.
