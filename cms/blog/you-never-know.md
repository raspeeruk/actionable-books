You never know what seemingly inconsequential chance encounter will lead to your next major client. You never know which employee will suddenly find a new source of inspiration and take your business to the next level. Which blog post or image share will go viral and put you on the front cover of your industry magazine. Which TED Talk will spark your next great idea, or which newsletter subscriber is going to become your next champion. Which product iteration will revolutionize your industry.

You never know for sure, so you keep trying.

You keep experimenting, keep putting your best foot forward. You learn, adjust and move on. You keep meeting new people and keep exposing yourself to new situations and influences. You keep pushing because no one’s going to hand it to you.

There will be “lucky breaks” and there will be unexpected setbacks. There will be fist pumping victories and moments of quiet overwhelm.

When you put your heart into something, you’ll get it all. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
