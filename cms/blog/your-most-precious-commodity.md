It’s likely no surprise to you that we produce a lot of content here at Actionable.

Each month we’re cranking out 16-20 summaries, half a dozen blog posts and an [author interview](http://actionablebooks.com/blog/categories/business-book-author-interviews/) or two. We have 4 active Facebook Groups, 2 LinkedIn pages, and over 30,000 followers on Twitter. We’re having fun doing it, too, but I worry sometimes that we’re contributing to the never-ending deluge of content that we’re all subjected to in the digital age.

Exhibit A

I’ve been a guest on almost a dozen podcasts in the last month, and almost inevitably, the conversation eventually focuses on **attention**. On how we have more data assaulting our senses every day that we’re required to be constantly intentional and vigilant with our focus or risk drowning in information overload.

I’ve talked about the importance of an **information diet** (deliberately limiting what information we take in, when and for how long)

I’ve discussed the value of asking “what am I going to do with this information?” as a practice for connecting with and understanding how much of our time can be wasted.

I’ve had long conversations about consuming for entertainment purposes (and how there’s nothing wrong with that, so long as we acknowledge it and don’t try to fool ourselves into pretending we’re being productive), and then limiting that entertainment to a schedule that provides opportunity to recharge, not procrastinate.

I’ve harped over and over and over again that **ideas are only valuable when applied**, and worked hard to make sure that the content at Actionable, at least is, well, _actionable_.

But I’m curious. **What do you think?** Do you feel overwhelmed by information overload (Here or otherwise)? Or – and this is far more interesting to me – **what systems, tools or practices do you have in place to surf the information waves rather than be drowned by them?**

One thing I know for certain is that this is a high functioning group of talented people, and I’d love to hear your thoughts.
