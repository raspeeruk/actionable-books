There’s a lot of satisfaction that comes with crossing another title off your summer reading list. All of that great new insight that you’ve gleaned; the pile on your bedside table that was precariously close to falling over getting shorter by the week. Wait, what? You haven’t created a summer reading list yet?! That’s okay. We may be in the dog days of summer, but there’s still plenty of time and it’s well worth doing. Here’s why:

*   Because life tends to slow down a bit in the summer, now is the perfect opportunity before things like school runs and social obligations start up again. Why not devote part of your summer vacation to delving into a couple of books on topic you’re curious or want to learn more about, especially if it’s a subject that’s related to what you do?
*   Being deliberate about the books you read in the summer leads to an increase in reading over the rest of the year (this isn’t scientific, but I think it makes sense so go with me on this one).
*   You can get through a bunch of books that have been gathering dust all year and make room for the spat of exciting new releases coming out in the fall. After all, who doesn’t love shopping for _more_ books?

What book has inspired you this summer? What are you still looking forward to reading?
