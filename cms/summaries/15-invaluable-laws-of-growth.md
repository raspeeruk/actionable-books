  ### What is your plan?


  > "Are you spending life merely reacting to events as they happen, or are you
  moving forward each day with a clear objective?...Your life will take place
  whether or not you have a plan, so have a plan. Choose one. Say YES!"- 20,000
  Days and Counting, page 81


  How, exactly, are you supposed to live out the rest of your days unless you
  know exactly how they are supposed to be lived? Robert’s key to living a life
  of intentionality and purpose is centered on having a plan for living. In
  quoting Henry David Thoreau, **“Take time by the forelock. Now or never! You
  must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in
  each moment.”**


  This is a real challenge to all of us who are breathing. Life in general is
  moving so very quickly that to actually think we can have the audacity to
  plan, dream, and take action to fulfill the precious thoughts we have about
  how life should be lived is extremely counter-cultural. How many of you have
  been told to just “take things as they come”, “don’t rock the boat”, etc.?
  Have you ever stopped to think if this advice would _help or hurt_ what you
  want to do in life?


  Having a clear objective each day about WHY you want to live the life you do
  and HOW you will live that life will bring immense clarity to any situation
  you find yourself in.

  ### You Only Have Two Choices...


  > "Of all the decisions we have to make every day, how many real choices do
  you have? There are only two. That’s right, just TWO. You can easily decide
  yes or no. How simple is that? But not always easy."- 20,000 Days and
  Counting, page 56


  The two choices we all have. Isn’t that an interesting perspective to use? How
  often do we have a tendency to overcomplicate and add stress to any situation?
  “Well, we could do _x_, but really that wouldn’t be as good as _y_; however at
  the same time there is always _z_ and you know how much I can’t stand to do
  without _z_…” Enough is enough. **Taking decisions and breaking them down into
  “yes or no” answers is a very small change that can add value to every
  decision-making process.**


  At the same time, Robert adds that you also must **allow yourself to say “yes”
  to open yourself up to the possibilities of life.** Think about things like
  this: how far do “no’s” get you? What if, over a period of 365 days, you said
  “no” to every person who asked you to lunch. Would you have added many new
  relationships or friendships to your life? On the other hand, what if you gave
  yourself permission to say YES!? Yes, to the possibilities and opportunities
  that come with it. YES to doing your best work, turning off the TV, and going
  out to live life. YES to saying YES!


  Robert acknowledges this is not always an easy and automatic response to
  situations. “But when you open yourself up to _yes,_ amazing opportunities,
  existing possibilities, and good results come your way. Marvelous memories are
  created.”


  What challenge can you own and say yes to right now, he asks? Can you break
  down your decisions to yes or no actions, and be open to the possibilities
  that both answers bring?


  Deciding how you want to live your life, planning it out, and then having the
  willpower to put that plan into action is not an easy, quick makeover. As with
  everything else, there is a process that you must go through, a shedding of
  past thoughts and paradigms and the making room for new ones to enter in.


  In the end, we all will create a legacy based upon how well we do with what
  each day brings us. We all have a simple choice to make each day: **Will today
  be a statement of my life purpose?** Will I love those around me? Will I do
  what needs to be done?


  You can only answer yes or no each day.


  What will it be for you? What will your life statement be? How will your next
  5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 days be lived?

  ### Your Search and Your Purpose in Life (in about 20 minutes)


  > "Your search is your purpose. Remind yourself of it daily. Remember that
  it’s the little things that add up to the big picture."- 20,000 Days and
  Counting, page 37


  This is truly what got me inspired about Robert’s book. If you have read any
  type of self-help book written in the recent history, you will find that many
  implore you to take a weekend, month, sabbatical, etc. and find a way to “find
  yourself” before penciling out a mission statement that may or may not really
  resonate with who you are. Have you ever tried to do this? I know I have, and
  have come away frustrated by the experience.


  The author says to follow this three-part process, and he gives us the
  following advice. “We are short on time, so we have to hurry. So be open to
  this. You must expect it to work; then it will.”


  1\. Get a blank sheet of paper. Title It, “My Purpose in Life”.  

  2\. Start writing. Right now. Write. Write all you can. Words, phrases,
  complete sentences, just write. Don’t stop. Write some more.  

  3\. Repeat step two until you get the answer that makes you either cry or jump
  up and down with excitement. Condense it into one sentence. _This is your
  purpose._


  I personally did this one Sunday morning, and the clarity of thought that came
  from this brief exercise was amazing. In a little more than twenty minutes, I
  was able to write down the major drivers in my life and put on paper what my
  life lived with purpose looks like. I have since made two copies and put one
  on the inside of each journal I carry for personal notes so I can review it
  often.


  The easy part of this is the actual writing. The more challenging part is
  dedicating the time to review it and read it each week to drive the point home
  that this is what your life should be about.

Personal growth is about change, and change is about choices that if made consistently can eventually lead to a desired destination.

Most people understand that they need to grow in order to reach their potential, but few are intentional about it, and fewer still have a plan to direct their growth. **People plan their vacations, careers, and even trips to the grocery store, but invest little time in plotting out their personal growth.**

To address this problem John Maxwell explains _The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth_. He concludes each law with an application section to help the reader digest the ideas taught and begin to put them to use. Through completing all fifteen exercises the reader gains a foundation for creating a personal growth plan.

While the author acknowledges that the steps each person needs to implement growth are situation-specific, the principles taught in the book are universally applicable.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Be Intentional About Your Growth

> "If you want to reach your potential and become the person you were created to be, you must do much more than just experience life and hope that you learn what you need along the way. You must go out of your way to seize growth opportunities as if your future depended on it. Why? Because it does. Growth doesn’t just happen–not for me, not for you, not for anybody. You have to go after it!"- The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, page 13

**“Do you have a plan for your personal growth?”** Think about 2013, with nearly a month under your belt, have you grown? Have things improved the way you had planned at the beginning of the year?

**No one sets out to be average.** No one plans to be mediocre. Yet often by failing to plan and intentionally seek out opportunities to grow, that is where some end up. You may have the best intentions, but then life happens and you never get around to those plans. To remedy this unfortunate, yet likely outcome, Maxwell \*\*strongly\*\* recommends setting aside time on the calendar dedicated to personal growth.

However, it is not enough to block out time. You must keep the appointment for personal growth as if it were with anyone else. That time must be zealously protected, lest it be sacrificed to another more pressing engagement.

### Develop Systems

> "Systems permit ordinary people to achieve extraordinary results predictably. Without a system, even extraordinary people find it difficult to predictably achieve even ordinary results."- Michael Gerber, quoted in The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, page 109

You recognize that you need to be intentional about your growth, but where to begin? Leadership, communication, attitude? Or maybe you know what to work on, but don’t know how you should begin. It is difficult to try and glean every morsel of wisdom from experiences on a daily basis. Before long you may feel overwhelmed and see little progress, leaving you discouraged.

To avoid this problem Maxwell recommends **developing systems**. He describes a system as “a process for predictably achieving a goal based on specific, orderly, repeatable principles and practices.” A system will act as a form of leverage that will assist you in achieving a predetermined result. Effective systems helped Henry Ford and Ray Crock build empires. Imagine what they can do for your personal growth.

**A system can help you focus on a specific area you want to improve and produce consistent results.** Unlike a generalized school curriculum, systems can be uniquely tailored to your priorities. Maxwell describes several systems he developed over time to help him focus on areas of personal growth. For example, he developed a system for storing quotes from what he learns. His system allows him to easily sift through the tens of thousands quotes and find what he is looking for within a matter of minutes.

Since reading the book I compiled a system for a more effective approach to my schoolwork, reviewing my days, and a new morning routine that creates time for a personal growth study before classes start.

Through implementing systems you can be intentional about your personal growth.

### Build Your Reach Muscle

> "…most people are naturally tempted to settle into a comfort zone where they choose comfort over potential. They fall into familiar patterns and habits, doing the same things in the same ways with the same people at the same time and getting the same results. It’s true that being in your comfort zone may feel good, but it leads to mediocrity…"- The 15 Invaluable Laws of Growth, page 163

**In order to grow, you must change.** To continue to grow you must stretch and do something different. It is only when you stretch beyond your current abilities that you grow. However, often this is done in reaction to circumstances out of your control. **Imagine how much greater and frequent growth would occur if rather than react to change you initiated it?** This is what Maxwell illustrates in the law of the rubber band saying, “**Growth stops when you lose the tension between where you are and where you could be.**”

If you fail to reach your potential, what do you miss out on? Ghandi believed, “**The difference between what we do and what we are capable of doing would suffice to solve most of the world’s problems**.” By continuously reaching and developing new capabilities you can avoid falling into a rut, or stagnating on a plateau for too long. **What opportunities are you currently pursuing that you believe are helping you to reach and grow?**

Set short-term goals to reduce the gap between where you are and where you could be. By actively seeking out new opportunities and developing your reach muscle you can become intentional about your personal growth.

As Jim Rohn says, “If you don’t design your own life plan, chances are you’ll fall into someone else’s plan. And guess what they may have planned for you? Not much.”

**Being intentional about personal growth is difficult.** It requires consistent effort and discipline, and it will be uncomfortable, which is why so few people are willing to do it. However, because so few people are willing to invest the time and effort to become intentional with personal growth you can easily stand out from those who are unwilling. You can become intentional in your personal growth by building systems that produce desired outcomes, and resolving to develop your reach muscle to help you close the gap between where you are and where you have the potential to be.
