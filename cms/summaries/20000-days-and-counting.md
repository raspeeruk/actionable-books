  ### Make the world better for future generations


  > "Movement toward leadership for the greater good is the expected level of
  ethics in a global society."- 7 Lenses, page 25


  Fisher Thornton writes: “When we use all 7 Lenses together we see a
  kaleidoscopic view of ethical leadership that honors its inherent complexity.”


  She moves through the 7 Lenses to show that there is an ever-increasing level
  of responsibility and impact:


  *   Lens One: Profit – Make Money

  *   Lens Two: Law – Comply

  *   Lens Three: Character – Be Moral

  *   Lens Four: People – Care

  *   Lens Five: Communities – Serve

  *   Lens Six: Planet – Sustain

  *   Lens Seven: Greater Good – Do Good


  The idea is to work all seven lenses concurrently, from making money through
  to concern for the greater good. If you just focus on Lens One, which is
  profit, or Lens Two, which is avoiding penalties by complying with laws and
  regulations, then money is where your morality will be, or you will be
  grounded in the punishment threshold of worrying about the need to comply.
  Instead, lead with Lens Seven, and focus on benefitting society and future
  generations. At the same time, always consider and integrate Lens Six, which
  is respecting life and nature; Lens Five, helping those in need; Lens Four,
  respecting others; and Lens Three, aligning your thoughts, words, and deeds.

  ### Leadership for the greater good


  > "Move from thinking about leadership as ‘transactional’ to thinking about
  leadership for the ‘greater good’."- 7 Lenses, page 119


  To show the expected evolution of leadership, Fisher Thornton talks about six
  connected trends shaping the future of ethical leadership:


  1.  Broadening scope

  2.  Increased visibility

  3.  Focus on protecting human rights

  4.  Companies contributing to society

  5.  Managing ethics as a performance system

  6.  Retooling skills to stay ethically competent


  Broadening scope is about moving beyond the local mindset to the global
  mindset. There is an increased visibility of products and services around the
  world, which means we should provide customers with positive experiences
  fueled by strong ethics and leadership. At the same time, we are all unique
  and all connected, making human rights and respect a critical component of
  every interaction. Companies should always be thinking about the business
  impacts on the environment and how they contribute to society. Ethics should
  be communicated clearly through an ethics code, incorporating consistent
  messaging through a moral compass. We need to be thinking as global citizens,
  collaborating across boundaries, which means constantly retooling to stay
  ethically competent.

  ### Apply moral concepts


  > "Bring out the best in people, organizations, and communities, with
  principles that are broad enough to provide a framework for leading ethically
  in any context."- 7 Lenses, page 31


  Fisher Thornton introduces 14 Guiding Principles of Ethical Leadership to help
  incorporate the 7 Lenses into day-to-day decisions and actions:


  **Lead With a Moral Compass**


  *   Principle 1: Demonstrate Personal Congruence

  *   Principle 2: Be Morally Aware

  *   Principle 3: Stay Competent

  *   Principle 4: Model Expected Performance and Leadership


  **Lead in Ways That Bring Out the Best in Others**


  *   Principle 5: Respect Others

  *   Principle 6: Respect Boundaries

  *   Principle 7: Trust and Be Trustworthy

  *   Principle 8: Communicate Openly

  *   Principle 9: Generate Effective and Ethical Performance


  **Lead With Positive Intent and Impact**


  *   Principle 10: Think Like an Ethical Leader

  *   Principle 11: Do Good Without Doing Harm

  *   Principle 12: Work for Mutually Beneficial Solutions


  **Lead for the Greater Good**


  *   Principle 13: Protect Our Planet for Future Generations

  *   Principle 14: Improve Our Global Society for Future Generations


  The first step starts with you – leading with a moral compass – which means
  consistency between what you feel, say, and do, and aligning your actions with
  your core values. As Stephen M.R. Covey states: “People who are congruent act
  in harmony with their deepest values and beliefs…The voice they listen and
  respond to is the quiet voice of conscience.” A foundation of moral and
  ethical awareness, and the continued development of personal competence, will
  earn the respect of others. From here, you will emerge as a strong leader,
  bringing out the best in others, moving forward with positive intent and
  impact, which can help shape the world for future generations.
f_conclusion: >-
  Throughout _7 Lenses_, Fisher Thornton invites leaders to think beyond
  themselves, and communicate openly about ethical responsibility and how to
  take action in our connected, interdependent world. Ultimately, the 7 Lenses
  and 14 Guiding Principles are meant to be transformative, and to release
  positive energy into the workplace, creating great places to work. It is part
  of a powerful and necessary movement, Fisher Thornton concludes, making us
  better leaders and people.

> "This is not a book to be used for passing the time; it’s a book to be used for squeezing every last day, hour, minute, and second out of your life until your life is done and you’ve given, loved, and celebrated all you could." _\- 20,000 Days and Counting, page XXI_

**How many days have you been alive?** It’s a thought provoking question, isn’t it? Death, as they say, is inevitable. But with that thought lingering in the background, the author asks a much more important question: **How do we want to live?** We have become so accustomed in this life to thinking in terms of years lived, but what would happen if we focused instead on counting and maximizing the DAYS of our lives and lived each one of them with a plan of intense focus and action?

This is what Robert D. Smith is saying we must do in his first book, _20,000 Days and Counting: The Crash Course for Mastering Your Life Right Now_. On the 20,000th day of his life, Robert decided he wanted to take time and not only reflect on how his previous 20,000 days had been lived but also plan out how his **next** 20,000 days should be lived. And he did this all in two days.

This is intentionally a short, quick read, as the author keeps a theme throughout the book of imploring us to get out and START LIVING!

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### What is your plan?

> "Are you spending life merely reacting to events as they happen, or are you moving forward each day with a clear objective?...Your life will take place whether or not you have a plan, so have a plan. Choose one. Say YES!"- 20,000 Days and Counting, page 81

How, exactly, are you supposed to live out the rest of your days unless you know exactly how they are supposed to be lived? Robert’s key to living a life of intentionality and purpose is centered on having a plan for living. In quoting Henry David Thoreau, **“Take time by the forelock. Now or never! You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.”**

This is a real challenge to all of us who are breathing. Life in general is moving so very quickly that to actually think we can have the audacity to plan, dream, and take action to fulfill the precious thoughts we have about how life should be lived is extremely counter-cultural. How many of you have been told to just “take things as they come”, “don’t rock the boat”, etc.? Have you ever stopped to think if this advice would _help or hurt_ what you want to do in life?

Having a clear objective each day about WHY you want to live the life you do and HOW you will live that life will bring immense clarity to any situation you find yourself in.

### Your Search and Your Purpose in Life (in about 20 minutes)

> "Your search is your purpose. Remind yourself of it daily. Remember that it’s the little things that add up to the big picture."- 20,000 Days and Counting, page 37

This is truly what got me inspired about Robert’s book. If you have read any type of self-help book written in the recent history, you will find that many implore you to take a weekend, month, sabbatical, etc. and find a way to “find yourself” before penciling out a mission statement that may or may not really resonate with who you are. Have you ever tried to do this? I know I have, and have come away frustrated by the experience.

The author says to follow this three-part process, and he gives us the following advice. “We are short on time, so we have to hurry. So be open to this. You must expect it to work; then it will.”

1\. Get a blank sheet of paper. Title It, “My Purpose in Life”.  
2\. Start writing. Right now. Write. Write all you can. Words, phrases, complete sentences, just write. Don’t stop. Write some more.  
3\. Repeat step two until you get the answer that makes you either cry or jump up and down with excitement. Condense it into one sentence. _This is your purpose._

I personally did this one Sunday morning, and the clarity of thought that came from this brief exercise was amazing. In a little more than twenty minutes, I was able to write down the major drivers in my life and put on paper what my life lived with purpose looks like. I have since made two copies and put one on the inside of each journal I carry for personal notes so I can review it often.

The easy part of this is the actual writing. The more challenging part is dedicating the time to review it and read it each week to drive the point home that this is what your life should be about.

### You Only Have Two Choices...

> "Of all the decisions we have to make every day, how many real choices do you have? There are only two. That’s right, just TWO. You can easily decide yes or no. How simple is that? But not always easy."- 20,000 Days and Counting, page 56

The two choices we all have. Isn’t that an interesting perspective to use? How often do we have a tendency to overcomplicate and add stress to any situation? “Well, we could do _x_, but really that wouldn’t be as good as _y_; however at the same time there is always _z_ and you know how much I can’t stand to do without _z_…” Enough is enough. **Taking decisions and breaking them down into “yes or no” answers is a very small change that can add value to every decision-making process.**

At the same time, Robert adds that you also must **allow yourself to say “yes” to open yourself up to the possibilities of life.** Think about things like this: how far do “no’s” get you? What if, over a period of 365 days, you said “no” to every person who asked you to lunch. Would you have added many new relationships or friendships to your life? On the other hand, what if you gave yourself permission to say YES!? Yes, to the possibilities and opportunities that come with it. YES to doing your best work, turning off the TV, and going out to live life. YES to saying YES!

Robert acknowledges this is not always an easy and automatic response to situations. “But when you open yourself up to _yes,_ amazing opportunities, existing possibilities, and good results come your way. Marvelous memories are created.”

What challenge can you own and say yes to right now, he asks? Can you break down your decisions to yes or no actions, and be open to the possibilities that both answers bring?

Deciding how you want to live your life, planning it out, and then having the willpower to put that plan into action is not an easy, quick makeover. As with everything else, there is a process that you must go through, a shedding of past thoughts and paradigms and the making room for new ones to enter in.

In the end, we all will create a legacy based upon how well we do with what each day brings us. We all have a simple choice to make each day: **Will today be a statement of my life purpose?** Will I love those around me? Will I do what needs to be done?

You can only answer yes or no each day.

What will it be for you? What will your life statement be? How will your next 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 days be lived?
