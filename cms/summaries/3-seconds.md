  ### Removing the G-factors


  > "…most people, however, are rescued from stressful indecision by their
  brain’s backup generator: gut instinct."- 10-10-10, page 36


  Guilt and Gut – two huge factors that permeate far more decision making
  processes than they rightfully deserve.


  Instinct’s a funny thing; it has allowed us, as a species, to grow and
  prosper. It’s ingrained in our genetic makeup, it’s unexplainable and it’s
  often illogical. Many top CEOs credit portions of their success to their
  intuition. Which is to say that intuition, in the true sense of the word, has
  its place. The true challenge lies in the often blurred line between
  “intuition” and “emotional reaction”. The primary differentiator, is time.


  The 10-10-10 model is designed to give our decision making processes time and
  room to breathe. While the model still gives us the freedom to factor in
  instinct, it does an amazing job of removing the “knee jerk reaction” that can
  be triggered by gut and guilt. By considering the immediate, mid range and
  long term impact of a decision, we provide ourselves with a framework from
  which to make educated decisions that resonate in harmony with our core
  values. The same framework gives us an easily understandable way in which to
  explain our decisions as well.

  ### Frame of Reference


  > "...it is with values as an integral part of the process that 10-10-10 truly
  becomes transformative, allowing us to live in sync with our authentic dreams,
  hopes, and beliefs."- 10-10-10, page 53


  You need to know your values. You need to know what you want your mark on the
  world to be. How do you want to be remembered? What do you want your life to
  stand for? Values can be challenging and often daunting things to define. Many
  people have used the famous “Proust Questionnaire” to determine their values.
  On pages 60 thru 62 of 10-10-10, Suzy offers her own values questionnaire,
  focusing on three questions:


  What will make you cry when you’re 70?


  How do you want people to talk about you when you’re not in the room?


  What did you love about the way your parent raised you? What did you hate?


  The truth of the matter is that trying to make a decision without values is
  like trying to travel a great distance without a compass; you might travel the
  same number of miles, but where you end up will be left completely to chance.


  The principles of 10-10-10 are broad sweeping, in the sense that they can
  apply to most aspects of life. Specifically in regards to work and career,
  Suzy offers, “Are we motivated by money, prestige, challenge, flexibility or
  camaraderie? It’s temping, of course, to answer yes to all of the above, but
  it is a rare job that meets every criterion equally. To really know your
  values, you need to confront how they truly stack up.”

  ### Should I stay, or should I go?


  > "Every 10-10-10 process starts with a question. That is, every 10-10-10
  begins with posing your dilemma, crisis, or problem in the form of a query."-
  10-10-10, page 10


  There’s a power in a question. What is it you’re really trying to decide?
  Specifically? We have a tendency to overcomplicate; to overwhelm. We as a
  human race have the remarkable ability to make decisions larger than they
  actually are. Fear. Doubt. Guilt. These and other lurking influences can creep
  in from the shadows when we’re faced with a big decision. One of the fastest
  ways to banish the distracting emotions is to source out the fundamental
  question at the base of the dilemma. What is it you’re really trying to
  decide? Say it out loud. Write it down, if that helps. The point is to
  crystallize clearly exactly what you’re trying to decide. One question at a
  time.
f_conclusion: >-
  Do you know what really drives you? There is an incredible value in knowing
  the hierarchy of your priorities. In each aspect of your life, what is it that
  motivates you most? What do you aspire to be, do or have? Being able to
  picture your ideal life gives tremendous clarity in the 10-10-10 decision
  making process.

_3 Seconds: The Power of Thinking Twice_, is a concise and clear explanation of how one small idea can have a great impact on many areas of your life. Written by psychologist Les Parrott, the ideas presented in this book are geared to actively help you change for the better, and promise to pervade all aspects of your life.

The key is to focus on the decisions that you make. _3 Seconds_ offers many examples of specific areas in which you can take control of your decisions, including _fuelling your passion, embracing a challenge,_ and _taking action._

There is also a terrific section devoted solely to how to make this way of thought a habit. It explains that simply reading the book is not enough! You have to take action. You have to train yourself to think through each decision and to not settle for less than whatever it takes, especially in moments when things are difficult. So let’s get started.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Take 3 Seconds Before A Decision

> "3 seconds stands between those who settle for ‘whatever’, and those who settle for nothing less than ‘whatever it takes.’"- 3 Seconds, page 13

The driving premise of the book is simple: Spend three seconds **thinking** before every decision that you make. Use the time to take responsibility for what you do, and to make proactive decisions in what you deem to be a positive manner.

The idea is not to accept your first impulse or the easiest path, but rather to consider your options and take the path that is _best_ for you. Remarkably, all this can happen (or have a much better chance of happening) by simply lengthening the time between (a) being presented with a situation and (b) making a decision. Which brings us to our first GEM.

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Take 3 Seconds and Choose to Walk the Extra Mile

> "Success always follows when you exceed people’s expectations"- 3 Seconds, page 134

In a world where simply “getting it done” is becoming the satisfactory norm, success can often be achieved by focusing on exceeding people’s expectations; by going the extra mile.

“The extra mile” isn’t necessarily about ground-breaking impact, this is something that can be done on any scale, on any day. Everyday examples include the supermarket associate showing you where the product is located on the shelf instead of just telling you where it is, or a company with lifetime guarantee for goods who exchange broken products with no fuss.

Going the extra mile really isn’t difficult, but it is memorable. We can all recall the positive surprises we’ve received in the past. These are the “extra mile moments” that stick with you.

Extra mile ideas outlined in _3 Seconds_ include…

*   Do more than belong – participate
*   Do more than care – help
*   Do more than dream – work
*   Do more than teach – inspire
*   Do more than earn – enrich
*   Do more than live – grow

An example of an everyday, small scale way of going to extra mile is to respond to all your emails within 24 hours. It’s easy to put off emails for a few days (virtually everyone does it), and so answering any emails that require a response, in both your work and personal life, will get you noticed.

It should be noted that extra mile actions are not going to be completed in 3 seconds, however. The 3 second moment is where you “challenge the impulse to go only the first mile, and choose instead to exceed expectations” (page 155).

### Insight #2

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Take Action Today

> "Make it so."- 3 Seconds, page 181

Choosing to exceed expectations, particularly in the larger projects in your life, can be scary. It requires you to put everything you have into a project. It requires an emotional commitment. It requires that you open yourself up to getting hurt. There are many reasons that prevent you from doing something you want to accomplish with excellence and the major ones are listed below, beginning with fear.

Before I list them though, I’d like mention a concept described in this chapter which is also touched upon in the Napoleon Hill book [_Think and Grow Rich_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/think-grow-rich/): **counting the cost to reach your goal**. Or to put it another way, “what will you give up to reach your goal?”

Often all it takes is time. For example: spending less time watching TV or playing computer games in order to devote more time to making your dream come to fruition. When you make the choice of what you’re willing to give up, you will feel more motivated to take action to reach your goals.

With that in mind, if you want to take your dreams of ‘someday excellence’ and make them happen, this list of actions for you to take right now, can help:

1.  **Confront the most common reason for fear: Stewing.  
    **Don’t just respond to a fear, challenge it. Ask yourself whether it is constructive or destructive, rational or irrational? This first step can help you feel less afraid and help you begin to take action.
2.  **Write down a list of goals. Include some ‘impossible’ ones.  
    **This is both taking action and making something concrete for you to aspire to.
3.  **Count the cost.  
    **The reward doesn’t come without a price, yet they should be counted together – reaching your goal makes the difficulty worth enduring.
4.  **Aim for the finish line – but take it one step at a time.  
    **As Stephen Covey says, “[begin with the end in mind](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/)”. Splitting your task into manageable pieces will then help you reach the goal.
5.  **Reach the point of no return.  
    **There will be one big step, a point at which you can no longer go back, when you are committed to what you set out to do. Be willing to commit and take that step.
6.  **Learn and refine.  
    **Mistakes are just new ways you’ve learnt to not do what you set out to do. All successful people refine continuously and constantly improve.
7.  **Make room for serendipity.  
    **When you have your goals in place, you will begin to notice the opportunities that arise to help you achieve your goals. As a personal example the author says that after committing to making a DVD to help train couples as marriage mentors, within a month he had chance meetings with first an investor and then a producer!

These 7 steps listed finish with one key quote to remember – if you’re ready to reach your goals, ‘make it so’.

_3 Seconds: The Power of Thinking Twice_, by Les Parrott, is a book filled with great advice, and it all starts with building the habit of taking 3 seconds before each decision you make. You will find yourself inspired and motivated to do _whatever it takes_ to _make it so_.
