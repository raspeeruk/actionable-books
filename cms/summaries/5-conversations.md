  ### Practice makes mindful


  > "Mindfulness is the ability to recognize what is happening in your mind
  right now—anger, jealousy, sadness, the pain of a stubbed toe,
  whatever—without getting carried away by it."- 10% Happier, page 103


  As a professional, the concept of slowing down and observing the moment can
  seem counterintuitive. Surprisingly, the biggest takeaway Harris shares with
  his readers is that practicing meditation should be rendered a tool in the
  great toolbox of success, rather than a hindrance. As a rookie, Harris shed
  light on his personal discovery of the seemingly earth-shattering concept of
  “letting go”.


  “There’s a difference between the raw sensations we experience and the mental
  spinning we do in reaction to said stimuli,” he explains. Quickly learning
  that “letting go” and “passivity” are very different, Harris, through his
  personal trial and error, fundamentally squashes the concern that meditation
  practice would result in a loss of productivity, progress or results. By
  letting go of mishaps, frustrations and setbacks, readers learn to replace
  them with valuable observations that drive growth and ultimately success. “Is
  this useful?” quickly became a personal mantra for Harris, and is a large
  takeaway for his readers.


  Harris shares the basics of mediation practice with the acronym R.A.I.N.
  (Recognize, Allow, Investigate, Non-Identification). While completing his
  first silent retreat, Harris learns to _recognize_ feelings that arose
  throughout the meditation process rather than attempt to ignore. _Allow_ gives
  those feelings and thoughts the space to be, and _investigate_ encourages
  participants to dig deeper into the affect of those feelings/thoughts on your
  physical person. Lastly, _non-identification_ is the logical last step,
  basically dismissing or refusing to allow those feelings or thoughts to define
  your character. This acronym is both a practical and intuitive practice for
  rookies and readers alike.


  A true convert, Harris makes it clear that practicing mindfulness is not just
  for people in loosely clad clothing with incense burning in every room.
  Mindfulness is a valuable practice that serves his personal life and his
  professional life well, allowing for growth, patience and ultimately success.

  ### The answer is non-attachment


  > "It’s non-attachment to the results. I think for an ambitious person who
  cares about their career… its natural to be trying really hard. Then the
  Buddhist thing comes in around the results—because it doesn’t always happen
  the way you think it should."- 10% Happier, page 206


  “Striving is fine, as long as it’s tempered by the realization that, in an
  entropic universe, the final outcome is out of your control,” Harris writes.


  Harris knows his audience, and identifies with them. Mindfulness is only a
  practice worth trying if it does not hinder the internal drive for
  professional results, thus this second insight is highly applicable. It is
  _easier_ to be mindful when everything is going to plan; difficulty rises when
  deals fall through, deadlines are approaching or hard work goes unrewarded.
  Through practice, one should gain the distance from effort and results,
  recognizing that “all we can really do is everything we can do.”


  Easier said that done, right?


  Right. For those who have yet to add meditation to their toolbox.


  Readers can identify with Harris as he struggles through this concept.
  Ultimately landing on the need to deepen one’s practice, exercise patience in
  development and maintain a heightened focus on process rather than the end
  result.


  “All I had to do was tell myself: if it doesn’t work, I only need the grit to
  start again, like when mind wanders in meditation.”

  ### Under Promise, Over Deliver


  > "I do it because it makes me 10% happier…counterprogramming against the
  overpromising of the self-helpers while also offering an attractive return on
  investment."- 10% Happier, page 154


  Practically speaking, this audience is looking for tangible and realistic
  takeaways, and after serving up the big \[and controversial\] push for
  meditation, Harris follows up with a modest promise. Give it a whirl, it could
  make you 10% happier.


  Having started out as a skeptic himself, Harris could anticipate the familiar
  questions that would come with sharing his journey. Admirably, Harris doesn’t
  offer a sweeping statement or vague promise of enlightenment; rather he makes
  it relatable and surprisingly appealing. Who doesn’t want to be 10% happier?


  Paired with the The Big Idea of “letting go”, readers are promised an ROI on
  happiness in all arenas of their life. Practicing mindfulness for 5 minutes a
  day, Harris shares, made him calmer, more relatable, more focused and more
  present in all areas of his life.
f_conclusion: >-
  In not so many words, Harris’s writing reads like it’s directed at his
  anticipated skeptics. As if he could anticipate the eye rolls, the immediate
  dismissal and the counter arguments, he lends a very biased but very relatable
  approach to his exploration and acceptance of mindfulness and meditation as a
  daily practice. Throughout his journey he ultimately crafts a sort of
  _Mindfulness for Dummies_ for professionals and common folk alike—dangling a
  couple \[very appealing\] carrots that even the harshest of critics would be
  foolish to snuff at.

  world where everything is constantly changing, we suffer because we cling to
  things that won’t last"

> “The quality of conversation we engage in could not be more important in the modern age.” _\- 5 Conversations, page 26_

Employee engagement is now recognized as critical to business success. _5 Conversations_ by Nick Crowley and Nigel Purse addresses leadership through the power of developing meaningful conversations, and offers powerful and practical tools to encourage employee engagement. True engagement is highly dependent on the quality of the relationships developed at work. Each conversation has to be authentic with the intention of appreciation, understanding, and trust, while also showing genuine care and compassion. The book discusses five key conversations which are essential to achieving success:

1.  Establishing a trusting relationship
2.  Agreeing on mutual expectations
3.  Showing genuine appreciation
4.  Challenging unhelpful behavior
5.  Building for the future

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### FIVEC

> "So the problem is that our brains don’t recognize the difference between a difficult conversation and a sabre-toothed tiger!"- 5 Conversations, page 54

Recent research has shown that various factors in a relationship can help to build trust. When more of these factors are present, the more likely you are to receive a positive response and build a trusting relationship. Conversely, when these factors aren’t present, the opposite will occur and relationships may sour. These factors are described in the mnemonic FIVEC which are critical components of the five conversations concept.

**Familiarity:** The concept of familiarity within the workplace has often being considered dangerous and undesirable. The modern concept is that by becoming more in tune with your team and being prepared to divulge more of your own needs and values with your co-workers, you can encourage mutual trust and respect to develop. This results in a more open and healthy discussion around critical issues at work.

**Influence:** Influence can extend to social and interpersonal relationships, resource control, technical expertise and perceived status. Influence may be perceived as either a threat or an advantage, so it is important to be deliberate about how you use your influence.

**Value:** This one is obvious. People want to feel valued and the easiest way to do that is to tell them, take the time to outline the contribution the employee is giving and authentically tell them how much they are appreciated.

**Empowerment:** Empowerment refers to the degree of freedom to act that the employee has within the organizational structure. Freedom of expression generally allows engagement to develop within the confines both individual personalities and their experience. A new employee will most likely want some hand holding and a longer term employee may resent micromanagement. It is important to establish boundaries around what level of support employees want.

**Clarity:** Lack of clarity about the future is often perceived as a threat. As a leader it is important to remember that people need and value clarity around the future, and to provide as much information as possible.

### Showing Genuine Appreciation

> "This conversation is also about showing that you care about not just the performance of your people but also about their emotional well being."- 5 Conversations, page 117

The traditional approach is focussed on problem solving and questions that tend to be based around “what’s wrong or what needs to be fixed?” The alternative approach portrayed in this book is built around the premise that everyone in the organization has positive aspects that need to be built upon. Switching these questions to something like, “what’s working well and what’s good about what you are currently doing?” allows a more positive framework to build upon. This concept is borrowed from some old research around “appreciative enquiry” which posits the belief that concentrating on problems tends to reduce the vision of opportunities in business.

The authors discuss the concept of appreciative enquiry in the context of a more personal interaction or more precisely, the second conversation, “showing genuine appreciation.” This conversation is based around the mindset of genuine curiosity about the employee’s success. It is recommended to have this conversation with every employee several times a year, and it can be either planned or spontaneous. Broadly the conversation should first understand and appreciate the individual’s contribution, and then explore options around future opportunities, and consolidate action plans and learning points.

The five conversations give all employees an experience of positive feedback and appreciation, but also gives you an understanding of everyone’s unique strengths and talents that they bring to the table. A win-win.

Potential questions include: “What’s been your biggest success in the last few weeks and how does that make you feel? How can we play to your strengths?”

### Insight #2

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Non-violent Tough Questions

> "This conversation is about having the courage, insights and resources to face up to another person's unhelpful behavior in such a way that you achieve a positive outcome for everyone involved."- 5 Conversations, page 113

Dealing with unhelpful behaviors or having difficult conversations are always considered some of the more challenging aspects of leadership and management. The conversations are about respect, primarily for your team members who have been impacted by the unhelpful behavior, and should also be respectful of your team member showing this unhelpful behavior. This can be achieved by showing that you genuinely want to help them to be successful, but to do so requires some changes to their behavior.

The structure of the conversation is based on nonviolent or compassionate communication, which has three underlying principles;

*   Acknowledgement of your own inner feelings about the unhelpful behavior and accepting your reaction to it.
*   Listening to your team member with the intention of supporting them and accepting that there are real reasons for the behavior which are not necessarily malicious.
*   Being prepared to express your own feelings and needs.

With these underlying principles the process of discussing unhelpful behaviors has four stages.

1.  **Observations.** This stage is talking about facts and observations of the non helpful behaviors in a non-threatening, non judgemental way and inviting a response. An example could be “John, I would like to discus the way you spoke to Sarah in surgery yesterday?” Follow up with “what was your recollection?”
2.  **Feelings.** This stage is about addressing the feelings the behavior has caused in you or others, and inviting a response. Acknowledging that these feelings are authentic is important as people can not challenge feelings. “Sarah was hurt by your comments, especially because there were many people present” and then revisit with “how were you feeling at the time?”
3.  **Needs.** Move the discussion onto the needs you need as a leader so they can understand where the disparities have occurred. “Sarah has a need to be treated with respect by you and her contributions should be recognized. What needs do you have?” It is important to invite a response from your team member about how they were feeling and how they are feeling now.
4.  **Requests.** Make a clear request of your team member. “My request of you is that you don’t make personal negative comments about colleagues during work, will you be able do this and what needs do you have?”

I believe we have lost the true art of authentic one to one conversations. This book will give you powerful and practical tools to overcome this deficiency. Many people take a confrontational approach to conversations—especially when they need to give feedback or correct behavior. This framework will help you overcome this urge, approach conversations with an open mind, and create trusting relationships.
