  ### The Seven Modes of Design Innovation


  > "...innovation planning’ is not an oxymoron. Successful innovation can and
  should be planned and managed like any other organizational function."- 101
  Design Methods, page 7


  How do you “plan” for successful innovation? By managing through these seven
  modes of design innovation through the stages of research (R), analysis (A),
  synthesis (S) and realization (Real):


  **1\. (R) Sense intent** – in this mode our focus is on figuring out where to
  start. We know we want to innovate, but need to pause and consider all the
  changes occurring in business, technology, society, culture, policy and the
  like.


  **2\. (R) Know context** – this mode is about understanding the circumstances
  or events that affect the environment in which our innovation offerings
  (products, services, experiences, brands, etc.) exist or could exist.


  **3\. R) Know people** — in this mode we further our investigation by
  strengthening our understanding of the end users and other stakeholders of the
  innovation we are planning.


  **4\. (A) Frame insights** – in this mode we bring structure to what we’ve
  found in the previous three research oriented modes.


  **5\. (S) Explore concepts** – the next step is to use the insights and
  principles framed in the earlier modes as a place to generate ideas and
  concepts.


  **6\. (S) Frame solutions** – in this mode we build on the large sets of
  concepts resulting from the previous mode and combine them to form systems of
  concepts, or solutions.


  **7\. (Real) Realize offerings** – this mode is about testing prototypes,
  evaluating them, and then moving them to implementation.


  Before listing the various tools and methods useful for each mode, Kumar
  discusses mindsets that will increase the probability that we will address the
  mode thoroughly.

  ### There's More than One Way to Skin a Cat


  > "Just as a master carpenter will expertly select a different set of tools
  depending whether he is building a house or a chair, the master innovator
  needs to be familiar with a variety of methods in order to choose them
  effectively for a given project."- 101 Design Methods, page 13


  One of the best things about Kumar’s book is that it provides so many methods
  to choose from. In a previous summary I wrote for Actionable Books, I
  committed to learning more techniques for generating ideas. To this end,
  Kumar’s book has proven extremely helpful.


  For each of the seven modes of his design innovation process, Kumar provides 9
  to 20 methods, from which a skillful innovator will choose to explore
  possibilities, generate ideas, promote ideas and see an innovation through to
  implementation and adoption. Each of the methods is presented on a two-page
  spread with an example of how the method was used in a real project on the
  left-side page and a detailed account of what the method accomplishes, how it
  works, and the steps involved on the right-side page. As an example, below are
  short descriptions of two methods from the “explore concepts” modes that I
  look forward to trying:


  *   **Persona Definition:** The first step is to write a list of potential
  users of the innovation. Then create a list of attributes for the potential
  users (e.g. demographic, psychographic, or behavioral attributes.) After
  choosing a manageable number of user types from your list, use a combination
  of the attributes for each user type in creating personas (e.g. Miguel, the
  safety manager, 28 years old, art enthusiast, avid reader of history).
  Finally, build a visual profile for each persona.

  *   **Concept Metaphors and Analogies**: The first step is to choose a
  starting place for using a metaphor or analogy (for example, the design
  principles that might have been generated in the “frame insights” mode.) In
  the second step you make comparison questions to generate metaphors or
  analogies. For example, “could a portable computing device act like a
  secretary?” or “could a barbecue grill act like a babysitter?” For each
  metaphor or analogy uncovered, the last step involves generating concepts
  around the possibilities they elicit. This can be done, for example, by
  answering “what if” or “how” questions (e.g. “how can a portable computing
  device be used as a secretary?”or “how might a barbecue grill be used as a
  babysitter?”)

  ### Adopt 5 Useful Mindsets


  > "The mindset for Explore Concepts is to be creative and open to new, perhaps
  radical ideas and ways of thinking; but at the same time, keeping sight of
  human-centered and context-driven principles for success that were identified
  in earlier modes."- 101 Design Methods, page 196


  Each mode of the design innovation process has five mindsets associated with
  it. Ideally, if you’re involved in an innovation project, you will engage in
  all of the mindsets. Below are the five mindsets of the “explore concepts”
  mode:


  *   **Challenging Assumptions**

  *   **Standing in the Future**

  *   **Exploring Concepts at the Fringes**

  *   **Seeking Clearly Added Value**

  *   **Narrating Stories about the Future**


  While the time constraints of innovation projects would make it impossible for
  you to adopt every mindset Kumar lists, an awareness of mindsets will help you
  choose from methods of research, analysis, synthesis and realization more
  wisely.

  **Like many others, I have often wondered exactly how to respond when business
  leaders tell us to innovate.** For me, Kumar provides clear guidance in _101
  Design Methods: A Structured Approach for Driving Innovation in Your
  Organization_. Now, not only do I have a deeper understanding of innovation, I
  have 101 practical methods that will help me successfully achieve it!

Wouldn’t you love to know what you need to do to succeed, to thrive in the future? Like many who are looking for sound guidance in today’s fast-paced, ever-changing world, I often peruse the business section of my local bookstore in search of such wise counsel. During one of my perusals, I was drawn to Howard Gardner’s _5 Minds for the Future_ because I know that Gardner is well thought of in both business and academic circles. Gardner, the Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, is the scholar who brought us the theory of multiple intelligences and The Good Project approach to work, life, citizenship, play, etc. In fact, according to the back cover of _5 Minds of the Future_, Gardner is so respected that he has been cited by _Foreign Policy_ magazine as one of the one hundred most influential public intellectuals in the world!

In _5 Minds_, Gardner lists the kinds of minds that he feels we all should adopt to survive and thrive in the future. The five minds are as follows:

1.  **The Disciplined Mind** – We will need people who have mastered a way of thinking that characterizes a specific scholarly discipline, craft, or profession.
2.  **The Synthesizing Mind** – We will need people who are skilled at gathering information from disparate sources and putting them together in ways that make sense to others.
3.  **The Creating Mind** – We will need people who are adept at breaking new ground, people who put forth new ideas, pose new questions, and promote fresh ways of thinking that produce unexpected results.
4.  **The Respectful Mind** – Because the world is becoming increasingly diverse, we will need people who respect and value those who are different from themselves.
5.  **The Ethical Mind** – We will need people who can think beyond their own self-interest and choose to act in ways that improve the quality of life and living.

Gardner asserts these five minds because he feels that our current education system unwisely promotes memorization of discrete facts rather than learning a discipline’s approach to solving problems; that contemporary society does not sufficiently understand the value of combining disparate sources; that our organizations set up systems and processes that impede creativity; that our organizations pay lip service to valuing diversity, but do not truly value what it contributes; and that our society pursues profit at the expense of the quality of life and living.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Do good work

> "A good worker has a set of principles and values that she can state explicitly, or at least acknowledge upon questioning."- 5 Minds for the Future, page 136

“Good work” is work that makes use of all five of the above minds and it is the kind of work we should all strive to do. It’s an ideal that may be hard to realize, but even trying is bound to have a cumulatively positive impact on the world.

When trying to ensure that you’re doing good work, Gardner suggests that you invoke what he calls the **4 signposts**. The signposts are as follows:

1.  **Mission** – What are you trying to achieve through your actions? Can you articulate the goal?
2.  **Models** – Do you have exposure to others who are doing good work in your field or a related field?
3.  **Mirror test** – Individual version. Look in the mirror and evaluate whether you are proceeding in ways of which you approve.
4.  **Mirror test** – Professional responsibility. Are you and your colleagues behaving in ways that uphold your profession? If, and when, you or your colleagues stray away from good work, are you held accountable for your actions?

Gardner doesn’t give many other tips on how to actually use or stay true to the five minds in your professional, daily life. To that end, insight #1 and insight #2 below are actions that will help you stay true to at least two of the five minds.

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Use your discipline

> "Most individuals in most schools or training programs are studying subject matter. That is, like many of their teachers, they conceive their task as committing to memory a large number of facts, formulas, and figures… Disciplines represent a radically different phenomenon. A discipline constitutes a distinctive way of thinking about the world."- 5 Minds for the Future, page 27

Think back to what you studied in school. In addition to learning and memorizing a lot of facts, what methodology did you learn to use? For example, if you studied history, you used primary sources and other evidence to piece together what happened in the past. The challenge that Gardner would present to you is to find ways to use this approach to help you in your current vocation.

My graduate studies were in linguistics, the scientific study of language. Though I am no longer working in the field of linguistics, I can apply the method of research that I learned in school to work in my current profession, leadership development. For example, rather than blindly accepting the ideas and practices articulated in best-selling books on leadership, I can test them by gathering data (quantitative and qualitative) and analyzing the data to see if the ideas and practices are working. If they aren’t working, then I can hypothesize what might work and then test my own hypothesis as well.

How might you apply your discipline in your life?

### Insight #2

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Look in the mirror

> "I prefer the concept of respect. Rather than ignoring differences, being inflamed by them, or seeking to annihilate them through love or hate, I call on human beings to accept the differences, learn to live with them, and value those who belong to other cohorts."- 5 Minds for the Future, page 107

I believe most people would agree that practicing respect, using the Respectful Mind, is something they support and strive for in principle. However, I also believe that _really_ practicing it consistently is a bigger challenge than we are generally aware of. I believe it requires self-awareness and recognition of differences. And, I also believe it requires the willingness to stop occasionally and check in with yourself, to ask yourself how you are showing that you value and respect an individual or group.

As I interact with others I often recognize ways in which they differ from me. I understand, for example, that some people dislike implicit communication and prefer a more direct, explicit approach. I think it’s good that I recognize this difference. However, can I say that I respect and value the difference? For example, when I interact with someone from a culture whose communication style is generally described as explicit (say, someone from Germany) do I value this difference? If so, I might ask myself how I am showing this. As another example, when my manager expresses a more detail-oriented approach to work than me, have I thought about how I might actually respect and value this different approach? Again, if so, I can ask myself how I am expressing this.

Here is a short list of categories to which I plan to apply the Mirror signpost. Which ones are you willing to take on?

*   **Generational differences** – Baby Boomer, Gen X, Gen Y, etc.
*   **Myers Brigg Type Indicator types** – ENFPs, ISTJs, ENTJs, ISNFs, etc.
*   **Cultural differences** – Chinese, American, Indian, German, French, etc.

What other kinds of differences can you apply the Mirror signpost to?
