  ### Go on a self-destruction diet


  > "Good habits are important, but it’s often our bad habits that prevent us
  from reaching our full potential. … \[Bad habits will\] slow you down, tire
  you out, and frustrate you. Despite your hard work and talent, you’ll struggle
  to reach your full potential when you’ve got certain thoughts, behaviors, and
  feelings holding you back."- 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do, page 7


  To develop mental strength, we have to go on a self-destruction diet. We have
  to stop doing, thinking, or feeling the things that drag us down and draw our
  attention away from trying to improve our situation. In trying to uphold a
  healthy lifestyle, we each have different temptations that pull us away from
  our goals. For some, it is eating sweets; for others, it could be a preference
  for binge watching Netflix over exercise. Similarly, in building mental
  strength, we each fall prey to different vices. Regardless of what our mental
  downfalls are, we have to stay the course on our self-destruction diets and
  build our resilience.

  ### Stay focused on the life you want to live


  > "Progress toward your goal might not always be a straight line. Sometimes
  things have to get worse before they can get better. And other times, you
  might feel like you take two steps forward and one step back."- 13 Things
  Mentally Strong People Don’t Do, page 240


  Another way we impede our own progress is by losing track of what we really
  want. Sometimes we fixate on an imagined life we could have had if we had just
  taken a different road years ago. Or we compare ourselves to others and chase
  lives we think we should want. Regardless of the ways we get distracted from
  the present, the consequences are the same: we become discontent, and this
  affects our overall life satisfaction, our relationships, and our feelings of
  empowerment to change the situation. In the book, the author cites a study of
  Facebook users who experience resentment and anger after seeing friends’
  vacation photos. Over time, this actually led to overall decline in their life
  satisfaction. Morin recommends several strategies for remaining focused on the
  life you want to live, including brainstorming the kinds of memories and
  activities that would bring you the most fulfillment, cooperating with instead
  of competing against others, and creating short- and long-term goals on which
  to focus.

  ### Get the facts straight


  > "Self-compassion means viewing your failures kindly yet realistically. It
  means understanding that everyone has shortcomings, including you, and that
  failure doesn’t decrease your worth as a person."- 13 Things Mentally Strong
  People Don’t Do, page 188


  Mental or emotional ruts are often based on distorted or incomplete facts. It
  is easy to falsely believe that our life experience warrants instant rewards
  or we should stop trying because a task is significantly more challenging for
  us than others. If we took a few moments to really evaluate others’ lives,
  Morin suggests we would discover a more realistic picture that can help us set
  reasonable expectations for ourselves. For example, the inventor of the Dyson
  vacuum went through 5,000 prototypes over 14 years before his first product
  arrived on store shelves. If James Dyson had stopped short of 5,000 attempts
  or overlooked the effort, time, or money it would require to realize his
  vision, he would not have had the personal success he enjoys today.
f_conclusion: >-
  The 13 things mentally strong people don’t do are likely intuitive to the
  self-reflective among us who know in their gut what behaviors they have to
  give up, but this book is helpful in lending a few strategies we may not have
  considered in exercising and maintaining our mental strength. Morin shares
  real-life examples from business leaders and her own work as a psychotherapist
  that bring life and context to these habits that help the reader relate their
  own experience. Which of these bad habits are the toughest for you to kick,
  and what has been helpful in keeping them at bay?

  "Developing mental strength is about improving your ability to regulate your
  emotions, manage your thoughts, and behave in a positive manner, despite your
  circumstances."

> "Think beyond ourselves in all of the scope and complexity that 'beyond ourselves' represents." _\- 7 Lenses, page 7_

Linda Fisher Thornton, through her compelling guide, _7 Lenses: Learning the Principles and Practices of Ethical Leadership_, offers a clear, relevant set of proactive strategies to help leaders along the ethical leadership journey. Sounds simple and easy – but taking action is the key. As Fisher Thornton points out, “we deal with a complexity of information that is expanding exponentially”, which makes the constant need for balance, particularly when impacting workplace culture, challenging and in a state of never-ending transition. Fisher Thornton views ethical leadership through a variety of lenses, which underline differing levels of responsibility and focus amongst leaders. These lenses encourage a collaboration of ethics and leadership, meant to impact day-to-day choices and actions. Always maintaining a learning perspective, Fisher Thornton reveals, is integral to success. And, leading for “the greater good” will lead to a longer-term outcome that benefits society and future generations built on trust and integrity. Fisher Thornton also has excellent credentials. She is the CEO of Leading in Context and one of the 2013 Top 100 Thought Leaders in Trustworthy Business Behavior. Stephen M. R. Covey has written the forward for her book and says it “insightfully pulls together the bigger picture of what ethical responsibility includes and at the same time provides enough detail to guide daily actions as leaders…instructively takes a long-term view of leadership impact, and is steeped in how to build trust at many levels.” _7 Lenses_ aims to encourage a level of global service, inclusion, respect, and care which results in a better world for all. So, what are the _7 Lenses_ of ethical responsibility?

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Make the world better for future generations

> "Movement toward leadership for the greater good is the expected level of ethics in a global society."- 7 Lenses, page 25

Fisher Thornton writes: “When we use all 7 Lenses together we see a kaleidoscopic view of ethical leadership that honors its inherent complexity.”

She moves through the 7 Lenses to show that there is an ever-increasing level of responsibility and impact:

*   Lens One: Profit – Make Money
*   Lens Two: Law – Comply
*   Lens Three: Character – Be Moral
*   Lens Four: People – Care
*   Lens Five: Communities – Serve
*   Lens Six: Planet – Sustain
*   Lens Seven: Greater Good – Do Good

The idea is to work all seven lenses concurrently, from making money through to concern for the greater good. If you just focus on Lens One, which is profit, or Lens Two, which is avoiding penalties by complying with laws and regulations, then money is where your morality will be, or you will be grounded in the punishment threshold of worrying about the need to comply. Instead, lead with Lens Seven, and focus on benefitting society and future generations. At the same time, always consider and integrate Lens Six, which is respecting life and nature; Lens Five, helping those in need; Lens Four, respecting others; and Lens Three, aligning your thoughts, words, and deeds.

### Apply moral concepts

> "Bring out the best in people, organizations, and communities, with principles that are broad enough to provide a framework for leading ethically in any context."- 7 Lenses, page 31

Fisher Thornton introduces 14 Guiding Principles of Ethical Leadership to help incorporate the 7 Lenses into day-to-day decisions and actions:

**Lead With a Moral Compass**

*   Principle 1: Demonstrate Personal Congruence
*   Principle 2: Be Morally Aware
*   Principle 3: Stay Competent
*   Principle 4: Model Expected Performance and Leadership

**Lead in Ways That Bring Out the Best in Others**

*   Principle 5: Respect Others
*   Principle 6: Respect Boundaries
*   Principle 7: Trust and Be Trustworthy
*   Principle 8: Communicate Openly
*   Principle 9: Generate Effective and Ethical Performance

**Lead With Positive Intent and Impact**

*   Principle 10: Think Like an Ethical Leader
*   Principle 11: Do Good Without Doing Harm
*   Principle 12: Work for Mutually Beneficial Solutions

**Lead for the Greater Good**

*   Principle 13: Protect Our Planet for Future Generations
*   Principle 14: Improve Our Global Society for Future Generations

The first step starts with you – leading with a moral compass – which means consistency between what you feel, say, and do, and aligning your actions with your core values. As Stephen M.R. Covey states: “People who are congruent act in harmony with their deepest values and beliefs…The voice they listen and respond to is the quiet voice of conscience.” A foundation of moral and ethical awareness, and the continued development of personal competence, will earn the respect of others. From here, you will emerge as a strong leader, bringing out the best in others, moving forward with positive intent and impact, which can help shape the world for future generations.

### Leadership for the greater good

> "Move from thinking about leadership as ‘transactional’ to thinking about leadership for the ‘greater good’."- 7 Lenses, page 119

To show the expected evolution of leadership, Fisher Thornton talks about six connected trends shaping the future of ethical leadership:

1.  Broadening scope
2.  Increased visibility
3.  Focus on protecting human rights
4.  Companies contributing to society
5.  Managing ethics as a performance system
6.  Retooling skills to stay ethically competent

Broadening scope is about moving beyond the local mindset to the global mindset. There is an increased visibility of products and services around the world, which means we should provide customers with positive experiences fueled by strong ethics and leadership. At the same time, we are all unique and all connected, making human rights and respect a critical component of every interaction. Companies should always be thinking about the business impacts on the environment and how they contribute to society. Ethics should be communicated clearly through an ethics code, incorporating consistent messaging through a moral compass. We need to be thinking as global citizens, collaborating across boundaries, which means constantly retooling to stay ethically competent.

Throughout _7 Lenses_, Fisher Thornton invites leaders to think beyond themselves, and communicate openly about ethical responsibility and how to take action in our connected, interdependent world. Ultimately, the 7 Lenses and 14 Guiding Principles are meant to be transformative, and to release positive energy into the workplace, creating great places to work. It is part of a powerful and necessary movement, Fisher Thornton concludes, making us better leaders and people.

While reading the book, I felt inspired to focus on the ethics of service, the greater good, and the value of honesty and respect. While these values seem simple, it is easy to get caught up in the minutiae of generating revenue and day-to-day operations. Yet, living at the broader level – of benefitting society and future generations – does encourage business changes that lead to greater happiness, every day, and greater fulfillment. Ethical leadership is a way of thinking that leads to new behaviour and outcomes that benefit everyone.

_How do you plan to embrace ethical leadership?_
