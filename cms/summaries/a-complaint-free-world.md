  ### The 4 Stages to Mastery


  > "It is a waste of time to be angry about my disability. One has to get on
  with life and I haven’t done badly. People won’t have time for you if you are
  always angry or complaining."- Stephen Hawking, as quoted in Complaint-Free
  World, page 53


  Let’s define a complaint. Simply put, it’s talking about things you do not
  want rather than what you do want. It’s a complaint if you want the person or
  situation changed. Directing a comment to someone who can improve your
  situation is not complaining. Berating others or lamenting your circumstances
  is.


  According to _The Merriam-Webster Dictionary_, to complain is to express
  grief, pain or discontent. For the author, this means we ought to develop a
  very high threshold of what would ever cause us to gripe – as opposed to the
  daily habit in which most engage.


  Just as it takes 21 days for a hen’s egg to hatch, the idea is to go 21
  consecutive days without complaining, criticizing, or gossiping. The four
  steps to form this new positive practice are:


  1.  **Unconscious Incompetence.** You don’t realize (unconscious) how often
  you complain (incompetent).

  2.  **Conscious Incompetence.** You’re uncomfortably aware (conscious) of your
  complaining (incompetent). Misery loves company and thus derives validation.

  3.  **Conscious Competence.** In this hyper-sensitive stage, you begin
  awareness of everything you say. You’re careful with the words you utter.

  4.  **Unconscious Competence.** It has now become unconscious (you don’t
  notice) for you to be competent (not complain).

  ### Say “Of Course”


  > "If you want to clean up the entire world, begin with sweeping your own
  doorstep."- Russian proverb quoted in A Complaint Free World, page 65


  Bowen further responds to those who question: _“But isn’t complaining
  (venting) healthy?”_ For certain, he’s not advocating silence when something
  needs to be corrected.


  Rather, we focus on holding a vision for our lives that attracts upbeat
  people. The non-healthy move on. Our default shifts to gratitude and
  appreciation. What a simple idea that good things happen in abundance when we
  leave our grumbling behind!


  Using old phrases in positive new ways is essential to living a Complaint Free
  Life. When something good happens (i.e., finding a parking space in front of a
  store on a rainy day or no windshield ticket after your meter runs out), say
  to yourself _“Just my luck!”_ and _“This always happens to me.”_


  Be like Hal – with stage IV lung cancer, given six months to live – going on
  to survive another two years. He proved in the midst of challenging terminal
  illness, one can find happiness. Avoid Jane, who would not be persuaded from
  death’s doorstep even after doctors corrected her diagnosis. She showed 67% of
  illnesses are a result of sick thinking.


  Both demonstrate the change we seek is never “out there”; it is within
  ourselves. Less pain, improved health, satisfying relationships, a better job,
  being more serene and joyous are probable – not just possible. Consciously
  striving to reformat our mental hard drive is not easy, but we can start now
  by using the steps Bowen presents here.


  As our collective minds begin to grasp that our lives, our health, our
  society, our political situation, and indeed the state of our planet are an
  out-picturing of the thoughts we hold, I’m inspired. The power of our
  individual thought to transform the world is a big enough. Why to go 21 days
  without whining – and well beyond!

  ### Using the Purple Bracelet


  > "A mind stretched by a new idea never shrinks back to its original
  dimensions."- Oliver Wendell Holmes, as quoted in A Complaint-Free World, page
  140


  When – not if – you catch yourself, you’ll start to see just how epidemic this
  negative behavior is in our world. Here’s how to slowly disentangle and
  release yourself from the trap:


  1.  Begin to wear a purple bracelet on either wrist.

  2.  When you catch yourself complaining, gossiping, or criticizing, move the
  bracelet to the other wrist and begin again.

  3.  If you hear someone who is wearing a purple bracelet complain, it’s okay
  to point out their need to switch the bracelet to the other arm. BUT if you’re
  going to do this, you must move your bracelet first. You’re complaining about
  their complaining!

  4.  Stay with it. It takes on average 4 to 8 months to reach 21 consecutive
  days.


  Mind, you don’t have to wait for your purple bracelet to arrive. Slip a rubber
  band on your wrist, put a coin or small stone in your pocket, move a paper
  weight to one side of your desk or find your own distinctive way of
  self-monitoring today.

Are you an “ouch” looking for a hurt? This is just one of many wonderful provocative questions Will Bowen poses in _A Complaint Free World: How to Stop Complaining and Start Enjoying the Life You Always Wanted_. Aiming to make the world a complaint-free zone, less than one year later more than six million people have taken up his challenge.
