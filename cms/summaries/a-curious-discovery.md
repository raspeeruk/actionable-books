  ### Curiousity Opens Doors


  > "I believe that if you scratch any entrepreneur you will find a little boy
  or girl who was intensely curious about the world…"- A Curious Discovery, page
  6


  Hendricks is an excellent storyteller. He shares how curiosity fueled his
  youth and allowed him to learn everything about a particular subject that
  interested him. At age 5 he could name the make and model year of every car on
  the road. At the same age, his uncle rigged a TV antenna up on a hill with a
  cable down to their home so they could get a clear channel, and he became
  mesmerized by Television.


  Hendricks shares the stories of his life in order to demonstrate why he did
  certain things, and how it shaped his entrepreneurial career. Recognizing that
  even though the path of each entrepreneur is different, he believes there are
  a shared set of stages in the creation of any successful entrepreneurial
  enterprise:


  1\. Curious observation  

  2\. Preparation  

  3\. Ignition of passion  

  4\. Idea  

  5\. Plan  

  6, People  

  7\. Brand


  No discovery occurs without a beginning of curiosity. **This is why curiosity
  is a necessary trait of an entrepreneur**. And as you gain experience and
  knowledge by following your curiosity, your experiences will combine to offer
  up a perfect opportunity (one you may have never seen coming.)


  Hendricks says, “My curiosity, my early fascination with television as a
  teaching medium, my college work-study job exposing me to the producers and
  distributors of documentary films…compounded upon each other, building a
  strategy beneath the surface of my consciousness that could be switched on and
  executed when the right factors were at last in place.”


  If you start with curious observation and gain experience with preparation,
  something will ignite your passion and you’ll be off and running with an idea.


  I can see that happening in my own life, and plan to keep opening doors with
  my curiosity.

  ### Connect with those who can help you


  > "This is John Hendricks. Can you connect me to Walter Cronkite?"- A Curious
  Discovery, page 116


  A big part of Hendricks’ success was his ability to connect with key
  individuals who themselves had connections and also knew the parts of business
  he didn’t know.


  In order to get big funding he needed individuals who could write $50,000
  checks, and companies who could invest $1 million or more. He didn’t know
  those people, but he knew someone who knew them. He goes on to describe an
  unbelievable story of meeting someone from his first connection who connected
  him to a lawyer who introduced him to a CEO of a large corporation, who then
  thought of someone else Hendricks should meet. Finally, he found an investor.


  His first attempt to contact Mr. Cronkite wasn’t successful. But the rest of
  the story ended like this, “Mr. Hendricks, this is Walter Cronkite, and boy, I
  think you are really on to something…” When Hendricks told Walter he would
  need some introductions to financial people in New York, he replied, “I would
  be glad to. I know a few people.”


  But it wasn’t always about money either. Hendricks built his core team with
  individuals who knew the ins and outs of the industry, were well-connected,
  and most importantly, believed in the vision of the company.


  **No one works alone. Relationships make things happen.** This is one thing
  I’ve learned in my corporate experience. Organizations or positions are only
  superficial boundaries that can disappear under a strong relationship.


  As I continue to open doors with my curiosity, some of those doors will be new
  relationships, along with the nurturing of existing relationships to increase
  my ability to make things happen.


  What doors do you plan to discover and open with your curiosity?

  ### Take Risks


  > "...that child is still inside you, forever curious… and every once in a
  while that child asks a question that is so compelling that it can’t be simply
  set aside as unanswerable. Rather, it has to be lived."- A Curious Discovery,
  page 7


  The moment Hendricks officially formulated his vision for cable educational
  programming, he began to sense and worry about an impending deadline to make
  it real. “What if they lived out my dream and left me behind with a lifetime
  of regrets?” worried Hendricks.


  This motivation put urgency in his work. He began to ask more detailed
  questions, and put in the time to answer them. “I became a man on a mission”
  declared Hendricks. And that mission caused him to jump in with both feet,
  jettison his career, and go all in on his new venture. This meant working
  fulltime on building his idea, taking out a second mortgage, and throwing in
  all his savings (basically everything he owned) to raise $130,000 to start a
  new cable network (while at the same time bringing a new baby into their
  family.)


  Now, I’m not saying I need to do that exactly, or that anyone does, but the
  principle remains that the more you put into an effort, **the more you’ll get
  out of it**. For me, I’m not ready to invest everything I have into a new
  venture, but I can take a little more risk by setting aside certain activities
  and putting more time, effort, and even funding into my own curiosity led
  dream.


  The launch of his company was only one example. Throughout the book, Hendricks
  continues to take big risks to gain the big rewards. And he didn’t always win.
  Valuable lessons were learned with each failure.


  Calculated curiosity was his guide to discovery.

> "But it’s my vision… I know I’m right – and if the Big Boys haven’t seen it, then it is their mistake, not mine." _\- A Curious Discovery, page 3_

Curiosity is a powerful thing.

So powerful, it drives people to action. And I’d call that the most powerful force on earth.

**People filled with curiosity do amazing things.** And that’s the story of John Hendricks, an incurably curious person, who thought that curiosity was powerful enough to build an entire cable channel around it. He believed that there were a lot more people like him, curious people with a thirst for learning all kinds of things about the world around them.

And the number one nonfiction media company in the world called Discovery Communications, with a public market value over $23 billion, proves that he was right.

But it wasn’t easy building a multi-billion dollar company from a simple idea. In _A Curious Discovery_, Hendricks tells the whole story, sharing all the roadblocks, setbacks, and close calls of his journey, along with the triumphs, good luck, and smart decisions that marked the path to where he is today. Along the way, he teaches important principles to entrepreneurs about **how to capture the market, get major investors, build critical relationships, take risks** and other key aspects.

After ‘discovering’ this book from my own curiosity, I’ve not only learned what went into creating some of the world’s most popular shows, but I’ve also learned what it takes to be a savvy entrepreneur with a dream.

I may not end up building quite the entity that Hendricks has, but my similar drive for curiosity will cause me to take enough action to see my dreams come true.
