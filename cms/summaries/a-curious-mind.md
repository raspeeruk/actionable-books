  ### Curiosity is the Key to a Successful Life


  > "Curiosity can add zest to your life, and it can take you way beyond zest –
  it can enrich your whole sense of security, confidence, and well-being."- A
  Curious Mind, page 9


  What do all the public speaking, leadership and self-help books tell you?
  Feeling confident will allow you to succeed. A lot of those books will even go
  so far as to teach you how to trick yourself into feeling confident so you can
  speak in front of a room of people, or effectively run a meeting, etc., etc.


  But what if there wasn’t a trick for feeling confident? What if it came
  organically because you allowed yourself to stop ignoring something else that
  was already part of your organic makeup? Wouldn’t that be a much faster,
  easier and long-term solution?


  Brian spends a lot of time talking about how we are all taught that asking
  questions are bad and that we should quell our curiosity so that we can become
  more efficient and successful at school, work, life. What exactly are we
  scared of? Why are asking questions about how something works, how someone
  accomplished a task, or how someone feels about anything so wrong?


  In _A Curious Mind_, Brian tells the story of his life through countless
  moments in time where he was able to start and accomplish things as a direct
  result of his natural curiosity. He attributes the doors that have opened up
  for him professionally and personally to specific questions or moments of
  wondering why something “x” he had throughout his life.

  ### Curiosity + Determination = Confidence & Success


  > "Curiosity rewards persistence."- A Curious Mind, page 109


  Curiosity can be a very powerful tool and harnessing it can lead to success.
  In this book Brian presents the following scenario. Think back to when you had
  a question, and weren’t able to find the answer immediately. If you gave up,
  you failed to use your natural curiosity. You instead allowed your frustration
  to win. If you harness you curiosity you persistently work to reward yourself
  with the answer to your question.


  Brian tells a story about how difficult it was to get _Splash_ made. He
  thought his idea for the movie was a fantastic story that was worth telling
  but countless movie executives disagreed year after year. It was his curiosity
  about the “why” they didn’t like the story, which was fueled by his
  persistence to find the answers that ended up in him making the movie
  _Splash_. He used the answers to his question of why the movie executives
  hated his idea to make changes that allowed them to love it and allow him to
  achieve his goal of making the movie in the end.


  As Brian so succinctly sums it up: “Persistence is the drive moving you
  forward. Curiosity provides the navigation.”

  How can asking questions make you a better manager, leader or businessperson?
  Take yourself out of the “manager” role and place yourself in the place of

  Being curious about your colleagues and the work they are doing inherently

> "Curiosity has been the most valuable quality, the most important resource, the central motivation of my life." _\- A Curious Mind, page xiii_

How can one be successful in life? How can you be successful in business? Curiosity is Brian Grazer’s answer. In his book _A Curious Mind: The Secret to a Bigger Life_, he weaves a tale of his life where the central theme is simply curiosity.

At first glance you might not think this is a business book or even a philosophical book about how to live a better, more enjoyable and meaningful life, but you would be wrong. It’s amazing how what is at its core a memoir becomes a tome for how to be successful and happy in life. The secret is utilizing your natural curiosity.

This is a book you can’t wait to pick up again, the kind of book you race home from work to read. Part of it is to read these amazing stories of Brian’s interactions with very interesting people; everyone from Andy Warhol to Tom Cruise. But, the other part is to share in the secret ingredient of Brian’s life and see firsthand how we all have the potential to be creative and groundbreaking just by being curious.
