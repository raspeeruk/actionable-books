  ### The Half-Brained SATs and MBAs


  > "'If you don't do well on {the SAT},' Sternberg says, 'everywhere you turn
  the access routes to success in our society are blocked." But as more
  educators are recognizing, those roadblocks can exclude people with aptitudes
  that the SAT doesn't measure.'"- A Whole New Mind, page 59


  A quick neurology lesson for you: Our brains are divided into two hemispheres
  – the right and the left. As Pink summarizes for us, there are four
  fundamental key differences between the capabilities and responsibilities of
  our left and right brains:


  1.  The left hemisphere controls the right side of the body; the right
  hemisphere controls the left side of the body.

  2.  The left hemisphere is sequential; the right hemisphere is simultaneous.

  3.  The left hemisphere specializes in text; the right hemisphere specializes
  in context.

  4.  The left hemisphere analyzes details; the right hemisphere synthesizes the
  big picture.


  Study the list above closely (minus the first point).


  **Left brain**: Sequential. Text. Detail.


  **Right Brain:** Simultaneous. Context. Big Picture.


  Answer “left brain” or “right brain” to the following three questions:


  What type of work is a computer best at?


  What type of work would you outsource to low-cost knowledge workers in Asia?


  What type of work are we taught in school? What type of work are we tested on?


  The crux of _A Whole Mind_ is this: Our education system, standardized testing
  and social recognition have traditionally rewarded only logical, fact based
  analytical thinking. Through the 70’s, 80’s and 90’s we recognized deductive,
  linear thinking as the cornerstone of successful business thinking. Efficiency
  was the name of the game, and MBAs reigned supreme. Time have changed. While
  the types of tasks associated with our left hemisphere (what Pink calls
  “L-directed thinking”) are still of value, it’s not enough. There’s a rising
  need to develop our right hemisphere capabilities as well. Sadly, as Sir Ken
  Robinson brilliantly outlined in The Element, our education systems haven’t
  caught up to the need yet. So it’s up to us to develop our “R-directed
  thinking” on our own.


  Through a tremendous amount of study, interview and first-hand experience,
  Pink has distilled six essential aptitudes for employees in the 21st century:
  Design. Story. Symphony. Empathy. Play. Meaning. Or, as Pink further
  categorizes them, “high concept and high touch” aptitudes.

  ### Develop Your Female Grey Matter


  > "Sometimes we need detachment; many other times we need attunement. And the
  people who will thrive will be those who can toggle between the two. As we've
  seen again and again, the Conceptual Age requires androgynous minds."- A Whole
  New Mind, page 174


  When we’ve got options (and we do – an abundance of choice in virtually every
  aspect of our lives), we look to the products, people and companies that mean
  something to us; to entities that “get us”.


  Relate-ability. Empathy. Meaning. When we were small town merchants we
  understood the value of connecting with our customers – truly caring and
  learning about their lives. We moves away from that with the advent of big-box
  stores and a cultural focus on price, but the tide is shifting again.


  Interestingly, it’s the traditionally labelled “female thinking” that’s
  growing in credibility and necessity in today’s business world. As a society,
  we’ve moved from wanting “quality” to wanting “quality, cheap” to wanting
  “quality, cheap, in a way that resonates with my sense of meaning”. As Pink
  says, _“Companies traditionally have competed on price or quality, or some
  combination of the two. But today decent quality and reasonable price have
  become merely table stakes in the business game – the entry ticket for being
  allowed into the marketplace.”_


  Today you need to connect, whether you’re launching a new product line or just
  selling an idea to your boss. While many would argue that we’ve moved beyond a
  “needs based” society and into a “wants based” society, I believe that there
  are still a good many unfulfilled, legitimate needs out there; they’re just
  not material. When you understand what makes your audience tick, and then
  appeal to that specific “need”, you win.

  ### Add the Flavour


  > "When facts become so widely available and instantly accessible, each one
  becomes less valuable. What begins to matter more is the ability to place
  these facts in context and to deliver them with emotional impact."- A Whole
  New Mind, page 103


  Google and Wikipedia have changed the game for good. Knowledge is no longer
  power. how could it be? Anyone with a computer can access the world’s
  information with a few key strokes now, putting us all on a (fairly) level
  playing field when it comes to information access. So, (as Chris Anderson
  wrote about in Free), when one resource grows in abundance another becomes
  scarce. The real value now is not fact and detail, but context and
  relationship. This is what Pink meant by “High Concept”. The details aren’t
  special any more. The relationships between the details are.


  The next time you’re working on a project, assignment or presentation, move
  past the facts as quickly as you can. Yes they’re still important. But rather
  than being the be-all-end-all of decision making these days, facts and details
  should act as a base for deeper, richer thinking. Ask yourself these
  questions:


  What does it mean about the people, circumstances and environment?  

  How does this relate?  

  Where else could this be applied?  

  What are the patterns? What could be the patterns?


  Look beyond the cold facts and numbers and look for the connectors; the
  opportunities to create something new. In essence, use your collected data to
  look forward as well as to look at the present and look back.
f_conclusion: >-
  _A Whole New Mind_ was a book ahead of its time. Since its publication it’s
  concepts have been touched upon in _The Opposable Mind_, _Linchpin_, _Crush
  It!_, and _The Element_ (to name a few) – all written by bestselling authors,
  all touting the importance of fostering innovation, creative problem solving
  and caring about your customer. The traditional MBA program may not be dead,
  but it’s in need of a radical facelift if it’s going to continue to create the
  leaders of the future.

Originally, I thought Chris Anderson started it. His 2006 landmark book, _The Long Tail_ is a complete and compelling look at business in the twenty-first century; a discussion as to how the internet changed the competitive landscape by increasing choice and accessibility and democratizing production to the masses. And then I found Dan Pink’s _A Whole New Mind_. Published a whole year before The Long Tail, _A Whole New Mind_ is a truly groundbreaking look at how Abundance, Automation and Asia are forever changing the role of North American “knowledge workers”… and what we can do about it.
