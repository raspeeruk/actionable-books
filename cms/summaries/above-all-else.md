  ### Dig Out Your Well


  > "Michael began again. ‚ÄòWhat I realized was that my heart was stale. It had
  grown cold and hard. There was no life in it. It had been robbed of the joy
  and wonder that had been in it as a child. To further the metaphor, it was an
  empty well. There was no water to draw from, so to speak, to provide life for
  me. There was a well there, but it was dry. I realized that everyone has a
  well, but we determine whether it is dry or full."- Above All Else, page 19


  We get caught up in the race sometimes. We become so focused on ‚Äúgaining‚Äù
  and on ‚Äúaccomplishing‚Äù that we forget why we wanted to achieve it so badly
  in the first place. What‚Äôs your reason for wanting personal success? If you
  dig deep enough, most people will tell you it‚Äôs about living the kind of
  life they‚Äôve always dreamed of. Just underneath that is a desire to spend
  their days carefree, with friends, family. That‚Äôs it. We just want to be
  happy, and to be surrounded by those we love and who love us. Money‚Äôs great
  ‚Äì it gives us an opportunity to have and experience wonderful things, but
  not if our lives become consumed with simply collecting more. I think it‚Äôs
  natural, though, to lose sight of the end game. We are bombarded every day
  with thousands of messages telling us to ‚Äúkeep going, keep working harder to
  earn more.‚Äù We really need to consciously take the time to ‚Äúdig out the
  well‚Äù, and remind ourselves of why we‚Äôre putting in all the effort in the
  first place. Just like cars need regular oil changes, we need to take the
  occasional time out.

  ### Go Solo


  > "Albert Einstein said that the monotony of solitude actually stimulates the
  creative mind. Thomas Merton said that it was in solitude that he found the
  gentleness with which to love others."- Above All Else, page 32


  For most of us, every waking minute of the day is filled with noise. We get
  up, rush through our morning routine and fly to the office. We spend all day
  listening to the radio, the chatter of coworkers or the constant “bing” of
  email alerts. We come home to our families, talk, watch TV and go to bed.
  Again, there’s nothing inherently wrong with this, except it doesn’t leave any
  time for thought. In order to reconnect with what’s important to you, you need
  silence and solitude.


  One of the reasons so many people have great ideas in the shower is because
  it’s the closest thing to solo time that they allow themselves in their lives.
  For 3-5 minutes they are alone with their thoughts… and shampoo. Imagine if
  you were to stretch that out to 30 minutes (minus the shampoo). What about two
  hours? A full day?


  Allowing yourself alone time to think, breathe, reflect and plan is often one
  of the most invigorating and productive uses of your time. It can also be
  scary, particularly the first time. Allowing yourself to be alone with your
  thoughts forces you to reflect on the person you are and are likely to become,
  based on the path you’re on. Scary, yes. The way I look at it though, I’d
  rather be scared enough to change now than to be unable to on my death bed.


  Take an hour of silence for yourself this week.

  ### Unplug


  > "Technology is utilitarian. It is a tool to be used. But most of it, by its
  nature, dehumanizes. Televisions keep people from talking or thinking, as do
  personal music players."- Above All Else, page 30


  I love technology. It’s a marvel to me how we can stay connected with people
  all over the world. It’s incredible to think of the things we can do,
  virtually through automation, that used to require incredible time and energy.
  But as Widener says, technology is a tool. Nothing more.


  A hammer is a tool. Use it for the right application and with the right force
  and it can help you accomplish things you’d never be able to do on your own.
  Use it for the wrong job, though, or with too much strength and that same
  hammer can become a destructive force. This week, I encourage you to look at
  every tool you use in the same way. What’s its actual purpose? What’s the cost
  associated with using it? (I.e. is using your headphones on the bus to listen
  to that song for the 36th time costing you the opportunity of meeting someone
  new?)


  I think sometimes we hide behind technology because it’s easy. It takes less
  courage to email someone than it does to call them. But it’s a lot more fun to
  have a real conversation. All the good things in life take effort. Disconnect
  this week – get outside (without your iPod) or play a board game rather than
  watch a movie or YouTube. Unplug from technology and reconnect with what
  really matters in life.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Above All Else_ is possibly the shortest book we’ve covered to date. At
  seventy-one pages (including six pages of suggested discussion questions) it’s
  a book you can literally read in an hour or two. The message, though, and the
  way in which it’s imparted is without a doubt one of the most rich and complex
  we’ve seen. In this, his seventh book, Chris Widener shows a depth of
  understanding as to the true meaning of life that we can all learn and grow
  from. Here’s to a deep, wide well for all of us.

There’s a lot of emphasis in personal development and business books on “making it”. Most every “growth” book you read is full of thoughts, attitudes and insights into achieving success. And that’s great. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to reach your own personal definition of greatness. However, in _Above All Else_ (the follow up book to [**_Twelve Pillars_)**,](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/twelve-pillars/) bestselling author Chris Widener uses the fable of King Solomon, the wealthiest man in history, to remind us that achieving it, maintaining it, and being content with success are three very different animals.

For those not familiar with the story of King Solomon, the short version is this:

God told Solomon he would grant him either wisdom or wealth, it was his choice. When Solomon chose wisdom, God rewarded him for his decision by granting him both.

Regardless of your faith (or lack thereof), the advice that Solomon imparts to his people is profound and universally applicable. With all his wisdom and wealth, this is what he said:

_“Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life”._

_Above All Else_ tells the story of Michael – a hugely successful grandfather, imparting his best advice to his teenage grandson. What makes this book so unique is that Michael speaks very little of “persistence”, “goal setting”, “overcoming your fears”, and the like. Instead, he speaks to the importance of reconnecting with the type of person you want to become, so that you can be happy with yourself as a human being, regardless of your level of financial wealth. As you will see, it is your heart (soul, spirit, self, etc.) that you need to work on in order to achieve (and maintain) true success.

### Dig Out Your Well

We get caught up in the race sometimes. We become so focused on “gaining” and on “accomplishing” that we forget why we wanted to achieve it so badly in the first place. What’s your reason for wanting personal success? If you dig deep enough, most people will tell you it’s about living the kind of life they’ve always dreamed of.
