  ### Solving Problems Anywhere, Solves Problems Everywhere


  > "Our days of isolation are behind us. In today’s world, what happens 'over
  there' impacts 'over here.'"- Abundance, introduction


  You have to admit, things are different now. Compared with even just a few
  years ago, the ubiquity of cell phones and the connection to information on a
  world wide scale has caused an explosion of collaboration and innovation, even
  the overthrow of governments.


  Specifically, the viral spread of cell phones in Africa has “had about the
  same effect as a democratic change of leadership” says business executive Isis
  Nyong’o. In 2001, 134 million Nigerians were sharing 500,000 landlines. By
  2007, Nigeria had 30 million cellular subscribers.


  Africa and other developing countries are skipping the wired cable
  infrastructure stage and entering directly into instant wireless access to all
  the same information that the developed world has, creating what Diamandis
  calls, “the rising billion.” These are the 4 billion people occupying the
  lowest strata of the economic pyramid, the so-called bottom billion, who have
  lately become a viable economic market. Individually, they may live on less
  than $2 a day, but their aggregate purchasing power creates significant
  possibilities.


  Crucial is the sharing of information, which is our latest, our brightest,
  commodity. “In a world of material goods and material exchange, trade is a
  zero-sum game,” says inventor Dean Kamen. “I’ve got a hunk of gold and you
  have a watch. If we trade, then I have a watch and you have a hunk of gold.
  But if you have an idea and I have an idea, and we exchange them, then we both
  have two ideas. It’s nonzero.”


  And ideas are spreading across the planet at remarkable speed. Over the next
  eight years, three billion new individuals will be coming online, joining the
  global conversation, and contributing to the global economy. Their ideas –
  ideas we’ve never before had access to – will result in new discoveries,
  products, and inventions that will benefit us all.

  ### The Power of Incentive Prizes


  > "…by their very nature, they \[incentive prizes\] are nothing more than a
  focusing mechanism and a list of constraints."- Abundance, page 225


  If you didn’t know already, Peter Diamandis was the man behind the X PRIZE;
  the incentive competition to find out which non-governmental entity could fly
  a person into space, return them safely, and do it again within two weeks. It
  was an amazing success and the story behind it can be found in other sources.


  The point Diamandis makes in _Abundance_ is that an incentive competition
  wasn’t a new concept. The first one that he is aware of was in 1714 when the
  British parliament offered £20,000 to the first person to figure out how to
  accurately measure longitude at sea. Not only did it work when a clock maker
  solved the problem, but its success launched a long series of incentive
  competitions, including Napoleon for food preservation, the French government
  for a hydraulic turbine, and others that have driven breakthroughs in
  transportation, chemistry, and health care, the most significant (to
  Diamandis) of which being The Spirit of St. Louis which propelled Lindberg to
  make his historic flight.


  The power of incentive prizes can be attributed to four main principles:


  1.  They raise the visibility of a particular challenge and create a mind-set
  that this challenge is solvable. (Example: human space flight by
  non-government entity.)

  2.  They break bottlenecks where market failures have hindered investment or
  entrenched incumbents have prevented progress. (Example: BP oil spill.)

  3.  Their ability to cast a wide net from experience in seemingly unrelated
  fields. (Examples: clock maker for measuring longitude, solutions to BP oil
  spill from 350 teams.)

  4.  They produce an increased appetite for risk, which further drives
  innovation, due to the competitive framework.


  Along with this is the power of small groups. With no bureaucracy, little to
  lose, and a passion to prove themselves, small teams consistently outperform
  larger organizations when it comes to innovation. Incentive prizes are
  perfectly designed to harness this energy.


  Diamandis is so confident in the power of incentive prizes that he created the
  X PRIZE Foundation, which has launched six competitions in a variety of
  subjects, has awarded four of them, and conceived of another eighty-plus that
  are awaiting funding.


  “They are a great way to steer toward the future we really want. So start your
  own. Help with ours. Whatever.” says Diamandis.


  “I’ve always believed the best way to predict the future is to create it
  yourself, and in my five decades of experience, there is no better way to do
  just that than with incentive prizes.”

  ### Exponential Technologies are Accelerating Global Change


  > "If you want to know if technology is accelerating fast enough to bring
  about an age of global abundance, then you need to know how to predict the
  future."- Abundance, page 51


  Exponential growth is a simple doubling: 1, 2, 4, 8. When you start below 1
  (as in .0001) the curve looks like a horizontal line for a while, 13 doublings
  before it gets to 1, but only seven doublings later the line has skyrocketed
  above 100. This quick explosion is hard for our mind to fathom, but it is
  exactly what is happening in multiple technologies, not just computer
  processing speed.


  It started in the early 1950’s when the Air Force tracked the accelerating
  progress of flight from the Wright brothers forward. They discovered a
  shocking conclusion: a trip to the moon should be soon possible. Sure enough,
  the USSR Sputnik and US rockets to the moon occurred right on schedule,
  according the exponential curve. Later, in 1965, the famed Gordon Moore
  discovered that the number of integrated circuit components on a computer chip
  had doubled every year since the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958.
  The trend has continued for 5 decades and is known as ‘Moore’s Law”.


  Diamandis and Kotler single out one man, Ray Kurzweil, as the father of
  predicting technological trends. In his multiple books, Kurzweil and his team
  of researchers make multiple predictions about the future. In 2009, 89 out of
  his 108 predictions made in 1999 came true outright and another 13 were close.
  Diamandis was so struck by the pervasiveness and potential of exponentially
  growing technologies for improving the global standards of living that he
  partnered with Ray Kurzweil to found Singularity University (SU), where people
  can study eight exponentially growing fields: biotechnology and
  bioinformatics; computational systems; networks and sensors; artificial
  intelligence; robotics; digital manufacturing; medicine; and nanomaterials and
  nanotechnology. Each year the graduate students are challenged to develop a
  company, product, or organization that will positively affect the lives of a
  billion people within ten years. While none of them has met their mark (after
  three years), great progress is being made.
f_conclusion: >-
  In conclusion, _Abundance_ contains a plethora of research and success stories
  to demonstrate that cutting edge technologies and methods are now being used
  to make dramatic advances in the areas of clean water, food, health care,
  education, energy, and freedom. The authors show us the real possibility of a
  world where every human has their basic needs of humanity met, and as we
  approach this goal, an even further acceleration of progress will occur.

What’s your prediction for the future?

You may think it doesn’t matter much. It does. Your perspective can actually have an impact on how the future turns out. Your view of the world will shape your actions. And your actions will shape the world.

That’s what Peter Diamandis and Steve Kotler aim to do with their book, _Abundance: The Future is Better Than You Think._ They want to change your world view (literally, your view of the world), give you some ideas about what is already happening, and show how you can join the revolution. They do this by describing in detail some of the new technologies and advancements in a variety of critical areas, such as clean water, food, energy, health care and how innovative solutions are emerging to solve the world’s biggest problems.

Understanding what is working and how you can contribute in a meaningful way will ‘expand your notions of the possible’ and have you saying, “Yeah, we can do this” by the end of the book.
