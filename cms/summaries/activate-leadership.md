  ### Your Diverse Point of View


  > "Your point of view matters"- Activate Leadership, page 118


  Before you are able to effectively lead others, you must first effectively
  lead yourself. The author makes a straight forward, often overlooked fact that
  “whether or not you take the time to define and be aware of your Point of View
  (POV), you have one”. In the book, we examine the following bullet points…
  Your Point of View includes:


  *   Leadership: Learned or Inherent

  *   People: Motivated by Good or Self-interest?

  *   Political Leanings: Liberal, Conservative or Moderate?

  *   Charity: Involved, Just Money, Both or Neither?

  *   Health: Exercise or not? Vegetarian, Paleo, Flexitarian, Uncertain?


  The point here is that your paradigm (or how you view the world), affects how
  you act in the various situations that present themselves to you. This
  paradigm impacts the decisions you make and ultimately the results you get.
  Once you fully understand this fact, you can then work to mold your point of
  view (POV) to what it is you desire as a leader. To effectively lead others,
  we must first fully understand and be able to lead ourselves. Therefore,
  examining and being clear on our own points of view is a critical first step
  to leadership success.

  ### Convert to Achieve Results


  > "With your adaptive tendency, you will make formidable leaders, especially
  with an enduring focus on converting."- Activate Leadership, page 132


  The insight from this chapter is the ABSORB-CONVERT-ACT Model. This model
  “helps leaders train themselves to move themselves and others from idea to
  action”. To break this down, let’s take a look at the definition for each:


  *   **Absorb** – be an information sponge. An essential ability of leaders is
  to absorb large amounts of information in a relatively quick way.

  *   **Convert** – do something with everything you absorb. Convert information
  and insights into action.

  *   **Act** – action is the movement of ideas into the world: changing,
  solving, doing.


  With us living in a world that is often in information overload, how you
  process information determines what you retain and how you use it now or in
  the future. Which brings us to the question, how do you discern what you
  absorb? Mertz gives us some good suggestions:


  *   From the information you took in, identify the big ideas, trends, or
  thoughts from it.

  *   From the big ideas, trends, and thoughts, what filters through as the
  salient points to consider?

  *   From those points, pinpoint the key action to move forward. Note: not
  everything is actionable!


  This is critical for any leader’s growth and development. Being able to learn
  new information, retain it and use it is important to our ongoing development.
  A big take away here for me was to strive to be very intentional about
  reflecting on what I read, hear from a speaker, learn from a
  seminar/conference and determine whether or not this information will be
  helpful now or in the future. Over time, these practices will become second
  nature and strengthen our capabilities as leaders.

  ### Patience Cultivates Growth


  > "Patience is not about waiting your turn. Patience sets a pace to learning
  and strengthening your capabilities by doing the work."- Activate Leadership,
  page 24


  The Millennial generation is the first generation that “grew up” with
  computers, the internet and cell-phones at their disposal. This has resulted
  in a couple of things that have defined this generation – the most educated
  generation to date, the most social generation to date, the most connected
  generation to date, etc. It has also caused Millennials to be the most
  impatient generation to date. Looking at this fact through the lens of
  business and career growth, many Millennials have the expectation of advancing
  quickly in their roles. That’s why this truth is so simple, yet so hard for
  this generation. As Mertz says, “for Millennials this approach is simple: Be
  patient for growth”.


  Having the ability to “pace” your learning, growth and development will allow
  you to not get so impatient. Mertz also notes that pacing is “the art and
  science of timing” and “is a skill to learn and master”. As Millennials
  advance in their careers, they must have the patience to trust the process of
  their development and cultivate these abilities “by doing the work, honing the
  skills you need, and learning from young and old”.
f_conclusion: >-
  In a time where workforce demographics are changing more rapidly than ever
  before, the need for strong leadership is absolutely essential for success in
  any industry. The fact is that by 2020 over 50% of the workforce will be
  comprised of Millennials, which is pretty crazy to think about. With that
  said, it proves to be a great opportunity for Millennials to step up into the
  leadership vacancies that will present themselves. The only question is will
  they be ready for that challenge? With the help of folks like Jon Mertz and
  _Activate Leadership_, the resources are there for Millennials to succeed. So
  Millennials, your time is now, are you ready?!

> "To the next generation of leaders who lead on purpose." _\- Activate Leadership, page 1_

_Activate Leadership_ is a book written to help Millennials develop the necessary skills to be successful in their current or future leadership roles. The author, Jon Mertz, calls himself the “Millennial Guide” and is the founder of the Thin Difference, which is a forum dedicated to empowering Millennials to be better leaders, build stronger teams, and create richer lives. Along with his work in the generational leadership space, Jon draws upon his experience in government, large corporations, and entrepreneurial organizations to give Millennials practical insights to build their capabilities.

The book is told through Mertz’s unexpected encounter with Aspen Groves (a tree species) on a family outing to the Rocky Mountains. Using this experience and these trees as a constant metaphor throughout the book, the principles discussed are compared to the characteristics of this tree while also being discussed through real world applications. The book is broken down into four sections which Mertz’s calls the Aspen Truths. They are:

*   ASPEN Truth 1: Patience Cultivates Growth
*   ASPEN Truth 2: Connect to Expand, Collaborate to Create
*   ASPEN Truth 3: Spur Purpose
*   ASPEN Truth 4: Convert to Thrive

If you are a Millennial that aspires to better your leadership capabilities, _Active Leadership_ will help you in your journey.
