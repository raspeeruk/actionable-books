  ### Be willing to fail


  > "We will have to make an uncomfortable number of mistakes, and learn from
  them, rather than cover them up or deny they happened, even to ourselves. This
  is not the way we are used to getting things done."- Adapt, page 22


  Published studies are about the experiments that worked, not about the trial
  and error. Often the news we receive from social media highlights others
  successes, not their failures. We filter our environment to observe
  achievements without knowing the process behind them. This results in the
  tendency to mistrust those who fail and doubt ourselves when we fail. Our
  brains have conditioned us to notice and celebrate success by making us feel
  good.


  Although it is counter-intuitive, failure is how we learn to succeed. Learning
  success through trial and error means accepting problems caused by errors as
  they happen. Whether caused by bad luck or misjudgment it is important to take
  the problems in stride. Rather than denying the failure occurred, evaluate and
  recalculate before proceeding. This produces much better results. The key is
  learning to see failure as a positive opportunity instead of a shortcoming.


  Take learning from mistakes one-step further and challenge your beliefs. Seek
  honest feedback even when the viewpoint of others is different from your own.
  Consider expert opinion but think for yourself. Ask what works instead of
  focusing on what sounds good especially in situations where the problem is at
  a distance. The more ways you look at a problem, the more likely you will be
  to produce a workable solution. Once we are comfortable with failure, we are
  ready for the next step, evolve.

  ### Failure increases risk tolerance


  > "Faced with a mistake or a loss, the right response is to acknowledge the
  setback and change direction. Yet our instinctive reaction is denial. That is
  why ‘learn from your mistakes’ is wise advice that is painfully hard to
  take."- Adapt, page 37-38


  We are more emotionally vulnerable if we have just suffered a loss. We are
  likely to keep our bets small while things are going well. Once we take a
  loss, our bets may become overly aggressive in an attempt to compensate for
  the loss. The right strategy is to recalculate after the loss and adjust the
  plan accordingly. Instead, we tend to react with denial; we often cannot let
  go of the memory of what we had, and the goal is to regain what we lost
  instead of look for new possibility.


  Be willing to take risks and try new things but do not take catastrophic
  risks. Some things will fail. Take the time to understand the failure and
  learn from it. Harford uses gambling as an example. When poker players lose,
  they are more likely to make bigger bets to cover their losses. The show _Deal
  or No Deal_ illustrates the same behavior; contestants who make an unlucky
  choice are unlikely to accept an offer from the Banker. In both cases, the
  initial loss often triggers a string of larger losses. The player is viewing
  their situation from their starting point instead of from the position they
  are in after the loss. If we do not take the time to reevaluate, we are likely
  to risk what we cannot afford to lose.

  ### Evolve to produce the best results


  > "Evolution is effective because, rather than engaging in an exhaustive,
  time-consuming search for the highest peak – a peak that may not even be there
  tomorrow – it produces ongoing, ‘works for now’ solutions to a complex and
  ever-changing set of problems."- Adapt, page 17


  Evolution is a success through the failure of the least fit. It weeds out the
  adverse selection and leaves us with the best option. This means we need to be
  flexible and try new things when ideas fail and realize what worked before may
  not work now. I imagine this is like being an octopus that can change its
  color and shape as it goes to adapt to changes in its environment. If we
  cannot change, we cannot be our best self in changing circumstances.


  To evolve, we need to think counter-intuitively. Effective planning is rare
  partially because of our internal bias to believe changing our minds is a sign
  of weakness. Willingness to adjust our plans as circumstances change increases
  our chance of success. We have all experienced the pain of failure. We often
  choose leaders who reassure us that they are consistent, they have an
  exemplary record of achievement, and they will never change their mind. It
  seems to be a guarantee of success. We do not vote for people who say they
  will explore some ideas and see what works. A willingness to experiment is the
  most efficient strategy historically. Success in business mirrors evolution
  and is the result of trial and error.


  Consistency seems safer than evolution on the surface. Honesty and intelligent
  evaluation and experimentation are qualities that produce excellent results
  over time. Instead of valuing these qualities, we tend to favor charming,
  charismatic leaders and agreeable followers with whom we identify. It is hard
  to distinguish between innovative genius and insanity because both states of
  mind are different from most people. We feel safer, choosing people who are
  consistent, it is more attractive. It is hard to identify with and accept
  those who seem different. It takes practice and courage to challenge our
  beliefs, to distinguish results-oriented, innovative leadership.


  As we learn to accept failure and practice evolutionary style creative
  decision-making, it is important to remember failure also increases our
  tolerance for risk and might provoke risks that produce a catastrophic loss.
f_conclusion: >-
  After reading this book, I have found it practical to use these ideas to
  develop a working strategy for managing problems inside and outside my realm
  of influence as the issues present themselves. I may not be able to control
  everything that happens in my life, but it is reassuring I have the tools to
  make effective decisions.

  "There are three essential steps to using the principles of adapting in
  business and everyday life, and they are in essence the Palchinsky principles.
  First, try new things, expecting that some will fail. Second, make failure
  survivable: create safe spaces for failure or move forward in small steps. ...
  And third, make sure you know when you have failed, or you will never learn."

Have you ever wanted a magic wand to solve problems, especially when they become overwhelming? Tim Harford gives us something better in _Adapt._ He provides us with insight on how to understand problems better whether they are big or small and get them solved. He demonstrates developing a better understanding of foundation principles, primarily variation, survivability, and selection as the keys to unraveling problems and developing workable solutions. _Adapt_ illustrates how problems from overwhelming complex global issues to mundane setbacks of everyday life have similar features and unexpected complexity. He says, “Whenever such problems are solved, it is little short of a miracle. This book is about how such miracles happen, why they matter so much, and whether we can make them happen more often.” We all need to work a little magic occasionally when things go wrong.

Harford provides us with a plethora of useful insight through a variety of illustrative stories that serve as paradigms for productive trial and error and innovation in decision-making. Pluralism, continuous experimentation, and learning from mistakes are at the heart of turning failures into success. However, for those to be effective, we must master the first step. The first step is the one we are often most resistant to: it is getting comfortable with failure.
