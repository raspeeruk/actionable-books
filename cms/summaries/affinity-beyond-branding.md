  ### Affinity Trumps Branding


  > "You need to think differently in order to do things differently."-
  Affinity, page 62


  As defined by the authors, **affinity is about feelings and bonding… a “magic”
  that forms the epoxy between buyers and products** (as well as politicians,
  given Goldfarb’s long-running stint as official Liberal pollster from
  1973-1992). **Think “chemistry”.**


  Branding, on the other hand, is a deliberate set of strategies to create
  recognition. It consists of numerous elements – management, image, identity,
  personality, and promise. The only thing is, **brands come and go**.


  Solely – affinity keeps relationships tight, lasting, and enduring. It’s the
  charisma of marketplace dominance; a force of attraction.

  ### Learn From the Best


  > "You cannot be an agent of change unless you are willing to change."-
  Affinity, page 17


  Citing an example men _and_ women can relate to – diamonds – **DeBeers** built
  upon pioneering work crafted by the Ayers Agency in 1933 defining, _“diamonds
  are forever”_. 1987 study results proposed associating the anthropological
  concept of a “potlatch” with diamonds, whereby the gem became central to at
  least four life-stages celebrated. A public display of wealth became tied to
  occasions like the 16th birthday, engagement, marriage, ten-year anniversary
  and 50th birthday. The stories woven were emotional – and resulted in the
  phenomenal success of more diamonds sold!


  Whether it’s **Apple** delivering a succession of innovative products (iPhone,
  iPad) that appeal to customers’ sensibilities and intuitions by helping them
  feel part of an exclusive community (even tribe)…or a hallmark of a truck
  brand that has survived since 1979 in the form of _“Built_ **Ford**
  _Tough”_…or **Petro-Canada** taking advantage of Canadian nationalism at the
  height of the 1973 oil crisis and becoming a galvanizing sponsor of the 1988
  Calgary Olympics…there’s a story here for everyone!

  ### Get Really Good at Story-Telling


  > "Story-telling creates indelible memories…that is why stories endure."-
  Affinity, page 21


  **Advertising is story-telling in a dramatic, concise fashion.** An eloquent
  expression captures the essence: _“Advertising is the poetry of our times.”_
  People reveal themselves in their tales; they reflect society’s values. In
  turn, stories tend to be told by means of advertising.


  Another clue to understanding culture derives from studying its artifacts.
  More than objects, they embody dreams. They bring meaning, satisfaction, and
  self-definition. Humans absorb their power and character.


  Evidence the story and “totem” of **Wonderbra**. Searching for novel ways to
  conceptualize “foundation garments”, late-1960’s San Francisco interviews in
  hotbed topless bars birthed a new signature brand called “Dicey”. A risky
  proposition, the sheer bra packaged in a cube captured an evolving culture.


  What Wonderbra learned (and the best story-tellers know) is that **listening
  to people is key**. The market researcher’s art is to discern not only what’s
  being said but also to interpret the drivers beneath what YOU think, what YOU
  see, how YOU perceive your conditions… Like a children’s legend endlessly
  requested, the iconic message (supported by commercials and advertising) of
  _“We care about the shape you’re in”_ endured for two decades and even today
  remains embedded in many a long-term memory.
f_conclusion: And that’s the beauty of this volume.

In _Affinity: Beyond Branding_, Martin Goldfarb and Howard Aster share their wealth of experience observing and understanding consumer behaviour via a fascinating mix of market research and social anthropology. Through their unique ability to tap into underlying cultural values, we intriguingly learn to unlock the secrets behind hugely-successful brands.

While many corporations strive to constantly re-create their image, branding “stars” attach themselves to consumers and propagate memorable values. The end result is that people want to hear their stories repeatedly – plus return to those products year after year.

And that’s the beauty of this volume.

_Affinity_ extends beyond branding because it involves “stepping out of the ordinary” into the next stage of consumer awareness and thus pushes the frontiers of global consumer consciousness.

It captures the value structure of a time, transforms product lines, creates leadership and followers, alters behavior, and redefines an aspect of our culture.

More than once throughout, **marketing is described as a force for changing society**. Never thought of it that way! What an inspiring big picture!
