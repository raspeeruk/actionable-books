  ### Finding a Different Angle


  > "Entrepreneurs often succeed by finding a different angle to do something
  for which there’s a proven demand."- Ageless Entrepreneur, page 53


  Early on in the story, Sam comes back to his hometown to do a keynote on
  entrepreneurship. During this presentation one of his key messages centers on
  the mindset of an entrepreneur. Sam states that often entrepreneurs succeed
  because they are able to bring something to the market that’s better than what
  is already there. This is a powerful paradigm shift and message. When it comes
  to who is considered an entrepreneur, most think about the person that creates
  the next great industry or company that no one has thought of yet, such as
  Apple, Uber, Facebook. While the founders of those companies are absolutely
  entrepreneurs, that’s not the only classification of one. Sam says: “that’s
  one of the entrepreneurial myths that you have to invent something new.
  Finding a better way to tap a proven market reduces the risk.”


  Looking at entrepreneurship through this lens allows us to consider less
  overwhelming opportunities to start a business or as Steve Jobs famously said,
  “make a dent in the universe”.

  ### The Mentoring Mind


  > "A mentor is an advisor and teacher. Someone, who inspires, motivates,
  educates, and encourages"- Ageless Entrepreneur, page 168


  Towards the end of the workshop, Sam starts to dive into the role and
  importance of mentors and coaches in the life of a business owner and
  entrepreneur. What was interesting was how he made the delineation between a
  mentor and coach. Sam says: “Coaches hold hands and ask a lot of questions.
  Coaches help find a solution within your own knowledge and skill set. They
  will never know as much as you do about your business but they know how to
  lead you to a solution.” He then goes on to say: “Mentors build knowledge.
  They prepare you for the path ahead by adding to what you know based on what
  they’ve experienced.”


  Understanding this difference is critical, in my opinion, when looking for
  guidance in your business. Mentors, by this definition, are those that have
  been to where you’re trying to go and can help you get there based on their
  experience. A coach, by this definition, can help to provide some context and
  insight based on an outside perspective. Both are important and have their
  place in helping you grow as a leader and business owner. The important thing
  is to be aware of which is needed for you in any given situation and not
  relying on just one throughout the life of your business.


  This is a constant in life, but by surrounding yourself with good people who
  help make you better will accelerate your individual and business growth. The
  same goes for an entrepreneur!

  ### Finding Inspiration


  > "Fear of failure is one of the strongest possible motivations"- Ageless
  Entrepreneur, page 115


  The lessons learned throughout Sam’s workshop dive into finding the
  inspiration and opportunity to make the leap to becoming an entrepreneur.
  Becoming an entrepreneur, just like anything else, involves taking on some
  level of risk. Sam challenges the class to start embracing their doubts along
  their entrepreneurial journey. He says: “What you’re feeling are simply
  internal warnings that trigger closer examination. Fears offer the same
  warnings. Together they are the tools of defining and taking managed risk as
  opposed to reckless risk.” In any career or industry, circumstances and
  markets change so much that it’s almost impossible to keep up.


  In order to navigate that change, entrepreneurs discipline themselves to face
  those fears and challenges head on. Often it’s those truths that motivate them
  to find success. Next time, you get that funny feeling in your stomach when it
  comes to making a big business decision step back, examine it, face it, and
  work through it!
f_conclusion: “Not all of us can be entrepreneurs. Every one of us can think like one.”

> "The most important skill we can learn today is the ability to create and manage our own career. It is never too early to start or too late to achieve." _\- Ageless Entrepreneur, page 17_

We’re facing an interesting, challenging time in today’s workforce dynamics. More and more young people are having trouble getting jobs in their area of study and seniors are being forced out of the work force at a time when they are unable to afford to be pushed out. Author Fred Dawkins addresses this epidemic in his newest book, _Ageless Entrepreneur_.

The book is written in a narrative format through the lens of a senior entrepreneur named Sam Macleod and his childhood friend, Nick. Sam is a public speaker, author and entrepreneur and the book takes us on his journey as he facilitates a week long training workshop with a mixed group of seniors and young people. His goal is to tackle the current workforce challenges head on to help identify ways this group can collaboratively revitalize their careers and futures.

As the story unfolds the author shares with us insights on the characteristics of successful entrepreneurs, common challenges faced by young and old people alike in the workforce, advice on how to manage career change, and how to change your mindset to think like an entrepreneur.

“Not all of us can be entrepreneurs. Every one of us can think like one.”

Sam says something important in wrapping up his workshop. “Not all of us can be entrepreneurs. Every one of us can think like one.” I think it’s the perfect way to end this narrative. Let’s face it, not all of us are cut to be business owners, leaders, inventors, creators, or entrepreneurs. The good news is that we don’t have to be. There is a great deal of value, however, in thinking and looking at the world like an entrepreneur does. Being someone who can see and recognize opportunity for growth, improvement, and service not only makes our individual value greater but also contributes something more to our society as a whole. Like Fred Dawkins says, it’s never too early or too late to make contributions to the world.
