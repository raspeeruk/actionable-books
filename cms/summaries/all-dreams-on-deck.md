  ### Dream specifically

  Cage believes in living a highly intentional life, both as individuals and
  organizations. This involves using dreams as the starting point for all
  aspects of our lives.


  He urges us to dream better, as so many dreams go unrealized. The first part
  of dreaming better is to dream specifically, in each area of your life. Using
  the image of grab bags in a lifeboat, name each bag by the essential areas of
  your life. Choose six to eight categories, rather than just “work” and “life”.
  Cage’s are work, family, friends, faith, fitness/sports, finances,
  philanthropy, and spirit.


  This way of thinking about your life and dreams reflects your true nature and
  needs. It’s the key to living life to your full potential, since it allows you
  make all decisions from the context of your “whole life”. Thinking about our
  life as having many sources of fulfillment, rather than just “work” and
  “life”, means that when something goes wrong in one area, the others can buoy
  us up.


  Designing dreams that you can clearly articulate gives you a structure for
  living—a life plan. Often, we cram so much of the little stuff into our lives
  that there’s no room left for the important stuff. We have to prioritize,
  protect, and nurture our dreams so that they’ll grow, or else we’ll fail to
  reach our potential.


  Vague dreams result in obstacles, fears, and dreads that paralyze us. Many
  people who get fired aren’t in work that aligns with their dreams. And the 90%
  of new businesses that fail usually haven’t kept focused enough on their
  dream.

  ### Plan and prepare


  > "Real planning and real preparation simply don’t happen often enough or are
  not undertaken with enough depth."- All Dreams on Deck, page 69


  Realizing our dreams in lives and businesses is mostly about execution, rather
  than just determining the vision. Whether it’s sailing around the world,
  winning an Olympic medal, renovating a house, or developing a new product, you
  have to know the plan and be well trained to realize the vision.


  Big dreams can take many years to bring into being and even smaller dreams
  need some kind of plan to be brought to life. In the years leading up to their
  journey, Cage and his family took advanced courses in radio communication,
  marine medicine, navigation, and mechanics. They researched all the
  homeschooling options for the kids. After much consideration, they picked a
  catamaran as their ideal vessel and had it built. And he got his manager and
  colleagues on board to help make it possible to take a leave of absence, years
  before they were scheduled to leave.


  In Cage’s experience, the more prepared you are, the more you’re able to trust
  yourself to live out a dream. If you develop your knowledge to the point where
  you’re considered an expert, you’re less likely to turn back in the face of
  adversity.

  ### Increase your intentionality


  > "Being highly intentional about your dreams means you will behave
  differently tomorrow than you did yesterday."- All Dreams on Deck, page 62


  People don’t just naturally realize more of their potential the longer they
  live, Cage believes. That depends on the action you take to realize your
  dreams. So after outlining your dreams in detail, increase your intentionality
  in stages. The “ladder of intentionality” is how dreams start to go from being
  theoretical to being real.


  The four steps on the ladder of intentionality are:


  1.  Think about it

  2.  Write it down

  3.  Declare it out loud

  4.  Get others talking about it


  As successful leaders know, effectively communicating the dream of the company
  or movement is the critical first step in achieving your goals. Unfortunately
  though, many leaders have never learned how to do this and they focus on
  boring objectives instead. Large organizations are losing out to smaller,
  quicker and more adventurous companies who are laser focused on their dream.


  Cage sat down with his wife soon after they got married to start planning
  their dreams. The more they talked about sailing around the world, the more
  things started to fall into place. They joined an online community and
  connected with a group of boats that would be crossing the ocean at the same
  time as them, which took them to next level of dream actualization—planning
  and preparing.

  Do you have enough adventure in your life and work? Do you feel as though
  you’re living life to your fullest potential? Try navigating your future by
  dreaming specifically, intentionally, and taking the time to plan with a
  purpose.

> "Both business and life should be an adventure." _\- All Dreams on Deck, page 5_

Who among us hasn’t imagined sailing around the world? It was a long held dream of Jeremy Cage, a business consultant and former international consumer goods industry executive. After many years of planning, he a set off with his wife and two children for a fabulous year of adventure and learning.

In _All Dreams on Deck_, Cage inspires us to be more deliberate about dreams in our lives and organizations. All individuals and businesses could benefit from seeing their lives and work as an adventure. We can do this by dreaming more specifically, steadily increasing our intentionality about our dreams, and planning and preparing for our dreams more thoroughly. His sailing expedition and experiences advising businesses provide great cases for what can be achieved through dreams. The result is a practical roadmap for bringing dreams to life.
