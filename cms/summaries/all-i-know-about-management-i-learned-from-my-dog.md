  ### Build a Foundation of Trust


  > "If a manager can develop trust, it will lead to corporate excellence,
  provided he is able to communicate effectively, make the right decisions, and
  above all, persevere."- All I Know About Management I Learned from My Dog,
  page 11-12


  Fostering a sense of trust is at the heart of _All I Know About Management I
  Learned from My Dog_. All management, whether of people or dogs, begins with a
  foundation of trust. Levin, who was admittedly “getting a failing grade in
  grief management” after the death of his beloved wife, was persuaded by his
  therapist to get a dog. So, it was with some trepidation that he visited his
  local SPCA. Shortly thereafter Levin left with Angel, a beautiful golden
  retriever/virgule chow mix. On the car ride home Angel sat in the backseat,
  shivering with fear. “When I decided to adopt a dog by the name of Angel,”
  Levin writes, “I thought this would be an interesting but not very challenging
  experience. Bad judgment.”


  The SPCA’s policy is such that Levin came to adopt Angel knowing virtually
  nothing of her previous history. He would later learn that Angel had runaway
  after suffering abuse and had fought for survival before being picked up by
  the SPCA. (When the SPCA found Angel, they contacted her owner who said that
  her husband had abused the dog. Heartbroken, she gave Angel the greatest gift
  all by refusing to allow her to return to that toxic environment.) The dog,
  understandably, was not quick to trust. For Levin the answer to making any
  sort of headway with Angel came from his six decades of management, and how he
  dealt with the teams he worked with.

  ### Communication is Key


  > "One of the publishers in Madras invited us to visit holy sites with his
  family, and as we walked together, he counseled that I was not communicating
  in a way that was relevant to the Indian culture."- All I Know About
  Management I Learned from My Dog, page 11-12


  In the 1950s, Martin Levin travelled to India on behalf of the Ford Foundation
  to create “a massive distribution system for books written in the five major
  language of South India.” When he arrived, he quickly discovered that the
  Indian publishers had a different expectation of how the money would be
  used—mostly because of inherent cultural differences. When Levin gave a
  presentation with his idea of how the sum of money should be spent, he was
  elated to see his audience nodding in agreement. It wasn’t until after that he
  learned that in India nodding your head up and down is a sign of disapproval;
  it is nodding from side to side in India that indicates agreement—the exact
  opposite of the Western culture. He was crestfallen.


  After his presentation, he became friendly with one of the local publishers
  who gave him a book of Indian fables translated into English. He devoured the
  stories, and one in particular stood out as representative of what he was
  trying to impart to his Indian audience. He related the fable to them the next
  time he met with the publishers, and they were now able to see his vision
  clearly. This anecdote had parallels half a century later when Levin was
  trying to communicate with Angel. The divide between human and canine is
  obviously greater than American and Indian cultures, but either way, doing
  research still proves fruitful in breaking down communication barriers.

  ### Expert Advice: Proceed with Caution


  > "The resourceful manager should be able to deal with an uncomfortable result
  and place the event in the ‘do not repeat’ file. The expert should not be
  faulted because this event was out of his control."- All I Know About
  Management I Learned from My Dog, page 29-30


  Expert advice is important, and should be solicited, especially when you are
  new at something, as Levin was in trying to gain the trust of his formerly
  abused dog. But Levin cautions that when moving ahead with any advice it is
  best to use your own judgment, as the results are ultimately on your
  shoulders. He provides an example of Angel’s first plane ride to illustrate
  his point.


  For any dog to be allowed to fly, they must be certified “fit to fly.” While
  getting the necessary documents, the veterinarian suggested bringing along
  Xanax (yes, Xanax) to give to Angel in case she showed signs of anxiety. “I
  thought that given the trust we had been developing between us, she would feel
  comfortable with me and Paula \[on the plane ride\],” writes Levin.


  Still, he took the advice of the vet and brought the pills along with him.
  Angel, as the vet predicted, began to shake midway through the flight as they
  reached a higher altitude. Levin acquiesced to the vet’s advice and gave Angel
  half a pill. No luck. Then the other half. Nothing. Hating to see his beloved
  friend in a state of such terror, Levin gave Angel an additional pill. It
  wasn’t long before Angel was completely comatose. When the plane landed, Levin
  and his friend Paula couldn’t wake Angel. They received additional help, and
  it was decided that it was impossible to carry the 71 pound dog, so they would
  have to lift her onto a wheelchair and push her through the airport. All
  through the terminal the motley party received glares as Levin pushed the dog
  in the wheelchair, and Paula hovered around trying to avoid “slippage”.


  This incident has its equivalent in business management. Levin stresses
  (especially when trying to gauge tolerance) the importance of recognizing that
  employing any advice has unpredictable consequences, which are ultimately the
  responsibility of the manager. So, proceed with caution. But, if you do not
  get the result you are looking for, at least you have learned a thing or two
  from it.
f_conclusion: >-
  Martin P. Levin’s _All I Know About Management I Learned from My Dog_ is a
  slim volume but effective. As the dust jacket states, “management doctrine
  need not be dense and difficult to read.” Often employing humorous and
  poignant examples, with the Four Golden Rules easily laid out, this book will
  help inspire a difference in the effectiveness in the way you manage—whether
  it’s fleet of employees or a single canine that you just want to return your
  love. Besides, the story of a zonked Angel being wheeled through a Florida
  airport is worth the price of the book alone!

How a successful and innovative manager approaches his or her job is more often than not inspired in the most unique and unusual ways. For Chip Conley, author of [_Peak_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/peak/), it was Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. For Martin P. Levin, it was his dog. When he adopted Angel, he thought that a bond would be cultivated easily and naturally. He was wrong. The bonding process with Angel would prove to have parallels to his many years of business management. Both Angel and his prior work experience would heavily influence Levin’s book _All I Know About Management I Learned from My Dog_, and its Four Golden Rules of Management:

**Rule 1:** Trust and Leadership  
**Rule 2:** Communication  
**Rule 3:** Problem Solving and Decision Making  
**Rule 4:** Perseverance

While the rules are simple to remember, like anything, seeing results in your professional life will take a great deal of care and effort, just as it did with Angel.
