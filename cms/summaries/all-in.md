  ### Beliefs are Emotional


  > "Blondin had hoped his fans would believe, as he did, in his infallible
  prowess on the high wire. They said they did, but they really didn't."- All
  In, page 4


  Clinical psychologist Dr. Kevin Fleming points out that our brains are wired
  to **feel** right, not to **be** right. Most of us are masters of four methods
  of resistance which **allow us to maintain existing beliefs:**


  1. **Counter-arguing** – Poking holes to **rebut** new information  

  2\. **Attitude bolstering** – Focus only on the facts which **support** it  

  3\. **Selective exposure** – **Ignoring or avoiding** new information  

  4\. **Disputing rationality** – Insisting our beliefs **don’t have to be based
  on facts**


  The authors provide a 7-step process to foster the kind of belief that got
  Blondin’s manager into the wheelbarrow.


  But first, they provide **3 questions to identify who believes** what in the
  first place.

  ### 7 Steps to Create a Culture of Belief


  > "How do you influence others to 'get in the wheelbarrow'?"- All In, page 19


  **You cannot create belief.**


  You can, however, systematically create an **environment where belief is a
  natural result.** Gostick and Elton provide a 7-step process to create that
  environment, to foster a culture of belief.


  1. **Define your burning platform** – **Communicate** your mission clearly and
  instill the proper sense of **urgency.  

  **2\. **Create a customer focus** – **Not** the bottom line, **not** position
  and title, **not** the next social media fad: focus on the customer.  

  3. **Develop agility** – Being flexible is reactive. Agility is **proactive,
  embracing change.**4. **Share everything** – Truth and transparency **create
  trust** which is vital to belief.  

  5. **Partner with your talent** – **Publicly and personally recognize** that
  your success hinges on the greatness of those you work with.6\. **Root for
  each other** – Belief can’t flourish without **peer appreciation** and
  camaraderie.  

  7\. Establish clear positive accountability – Positive accountability means
  employees have the tools they need to meet the goals set by management,
  including authority to match their responsibility. Positive accountability
  flows up to managers, not just down to employees.


  This is not an easy process, a quick fix. Nor will it convert active
  disbelievers.


  But in the hands of a manager or entrepreneur who believes that his business
  associates are **looking for something to believe in,** it’s a viable process
  to amplify the culture of belief in even the best organization.

  ### Engagement is Not Enough: Enable and Energize


  > "A hamster on a treadmill is energized, for example, but it doesn't really
  accomplish much . . . an eager new military cadet may be engaged . . . but
  without training and the right support, he's unlikely to be of much use to his
  comrades. A teenager can be given all of the enabling freedom in the world,
  but if she isn't absorbed in an interesting challenge she . . . won't
  accomplish much."- All In, page 47


  To clarify the need for more than engagement, ask yourself these questions
  about the people you work with. They’re worded as a manager assessing
  employees, but try them with reference to business partners, vendors, and hey,
  **how about yourself?**


  1\. Do you have employees who care about the organization but are burned
  out?  

  2\. Do you have people who are energized to do big things but feel stifled and
  not able to run?  

  3\. Do you have employees who care but aren’t always focused on the right
  behaviors?


  These folks are certainly **engaged,** aren’t they? But are they the people
  who’ll take your business, your life, to **heights of excellence?** Hardly.


  Beyond **engagement**, people need to be **energized** and **enabled**. E + E
  + E. They need an environment which **builds enthusiasm** instead of burning
  it out. They need the **tools** to do the work. They need to be engaged, not
  just with the step they’re taking now but with the **dreams on the horizon.**

The Great Blondin didn’t settle for simply walking across a high wire strung above Niagara Falls. Back flips. Chairs. In the quote above, a wheelbarrow.

There’s a world of difference between what we **say** we believe and what our actions **show** we believe.

The fans were delighted **to watch.** Participate? _No thank you._

One man did. Blondin’s manager, Harry Colcord, climbed up and got in the wheelbarrow.

That is the kind of belief which makes **the difference between mediocrity and excellence.**

But in the hands of a manager or entrepreneur who believes that his business associates are **looking for something to believe in,** it’s a viable process to amplify the culture of belief in even the best organization.

What made Ferdinand and Isabella support **Columbus?**

What made thousands of Apple employees follow **Steve Jobs?**

What made a **quarter of a million people march** on Washington, DC on August 28, 1963?

It wasn’t **facts**. It wasn’t **comfort** or **convenience**. It certainly wasn’t a **paycheck**.

**Belief drives every single action we take.**

What are you doing to cultivate it in the people you work with?

**E + E + E.** Individually, they’re vital. In concert, they not only raise profit margins to multiples of the competition’s, they create **cultures** which become the stuff of legend.

That may not describe your work efforts right now. A team which is engaged, enabled, and energized is the result of a culture of belief. And that is a result of 7 steps you can **plan** and **implement**.
