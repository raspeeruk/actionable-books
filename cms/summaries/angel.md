  ### Do the Work – Prepare for the Meetings


  > "Life is short, you should spend your time working with good people, and if
  you do get screwed, look at it as a small price to pay for getting that person
  out of your life."- Angel, Kindle Location 928-929


  The large risk to an angel investor is the lack of preparation and analysis.
  Feeling and emotion are part of the job. However, with 90% plus startups
  failing, it’s a necessity to develop a rhythm and complete the due diligence
  beyond your gut instinct. Calacanis recommends asking yourself four questions
  as you meet with prospective startup founders:


  1.  _Why has this founder chosen this business?_

  2.  _How committed is this founder?_

  3.  _What are this founder’s chances of succeeding in this business—and in
  life?_

  4.  _What does winning look like in terms of revenue and my return?_


  Designed to help you dig deeper, these questions help you understand how this
  startup aligns with your own goals. Allocate three hours for each startup
  meeting, including preparation, time with the founders, and completing a
  post-mortem.


  It’s critical to develop the meeting and the pitch down to a fine science. You
  will meet with so many founders, investors and stakeholders. Getting to the
  essentials helps to effectively and efficiently make a decision.

  ### Become a Startup Detective


  > "Groupthink or perhaps even delusional thinking also tends to set in during
  investing, with people looking around the bargaining table at each other and
  thinking, 'If nothing is scaring off those other three successful investors,
  then I’m not worried, either. I’m sure if something was wrong, one of them
  would have uncovered it.'"- Angel, Kindle Locations 2125-2127


  The startup world is dynamic and complex. Calacanis reminds us that we need to
  couple the need to do the work along with the research. Over a third of the
  book covers how to become a seasoned investigator through practice and
  discipline. In one section, he provides five investigative questions, the
  responses of which will provide insight into the startup, as well as the
  genuineness and confidence of the founder(s):


  1.  _Tell me about the competition._

  2.  _How do you make money?_

  3.  _How much do you charge customers?_

  4.  _How much does your average customer spend?_

  5.  _Tell me the top three reasons why this business might fail._


  These questions help you ensure that these areas line up. If you see any
  incongruences, then go deeper or consider walking away.


  Calacanis wants you to never assume that other investors have caught
  everything, regardless of their notability or previous success. In this
  marketplace, each experienced investor brings a new perspective. These may
  overlap but, importantly, fill in more gaps.


  Startup success is highly dependent on awareness and minimizing being
  blindsided. Diversity and meaningful diligence raises the bar.

  ### Fight for Pro Rata Rights


  > "Most founders will give their angel investors pro rata rights. If they
  don’t, something is off. Why wouldn’t you want your early investors to get
  rewarded?"- Angel, Kindle Location 1911-1912


  A nuance about the angel investing world is the concept of pro rata rights.


  As an angel investor, a handful of your startups may continue to raise money
  in later rounds. During these rounds, your percentage of ownership in the
  startup can become diluted. To maintain your ownership stake, you will need to
  make further investment. However, when not requested and defended, you may not
  have that right.


  Pro rata rights preserve the angel’s opportunity to maintain their percentage
  ownership in future rounds of investment.


  Calacanis is adamant about this. He believes the collective angel community
  should make this a status quo. A good angel investor bears most of the risk,
  time and network during the inertia of a new company. Don’t they deserve the
  opportunity to also benefit from the ride?


  Before you sign a check, make sure pro rata rights are in place and let it be
  a warning sign if you’re refused.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Angel_ is one of those books that you’ll not only find entertaining, but also
  hugely informative. It will help you gain a unique perspective into the
  startup culture and ecosystem.

Throughout the book, Calacanis reminds us over and over that luck is established through forging genuine relationships with others. He even speaks of people who are smarter than he is seeking advice from him. The flipside also very much applies.
