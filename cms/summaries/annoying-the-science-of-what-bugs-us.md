  ### One Part Unpredictability, One Part Unpleasantness


  > "Or you could adopt the attitude of the Ifaluk islanders and simply accept
  the annoyance, realize that it’s an inherent component of the social milieu in
  which you find yourself, and move on. You could try that."- Annoying, page
  243-244


  There seems to be a recipe for what’s annoying and that recipe has three
  ingredients – unpredictability, unpleasantness and the certainty that it will
  end but the uncertainty of when. Annoyingness also seems to be related to the
  senses – how we hear, see or taste in certain situations impacts how irritated
  or annoyed we get. Research has shown that the sound of nails on a chalk board
  can be annoying because of the frequency or pitch of the sound – “the
  frequencies that contribute most to the annoyingness of the scraping sound are
  on the low end of the frequency range that our ear is most sensitive to.”
  (page 50) Ear preservation is one hypothesis to explain why the screech makes
  us cringe – “a sensible way to protect our hearing is to evolve an aversion to
  sounds that are damaging.” (page 51). Preventing, or at least lessening the
  effects of, annoyance takes patience and focus – intentional and conscious
  attention to what is annoying us and altering the situation to the best of our
  ability.

  ### Control what we can control and the rest will take care of itself

  that it will be over amplifies every additional second that you have to put up
  with it."- Annoying, page 9


  When someone’s talking on their cell phone while I’m riding the bus, I can’t
  help but overhear – I listen in, my ears automatically tuning into the sound
  of their voice, and try to figure out what words are going to come out next.


  According to researchers at the University of York, “our brains are always
  predicting what’s going to happen next, based on our current state of
  knowledge” (page 4), which is why cell phone conversations are so annoying –
  it’s hard to predict when the person will start talking again and what that
  person is going to say when he does open his mouth. It’s this unpredictability
  that’s so annoying – we have an easier time ignoring something that is stable,
  steady and routine. When things have a rhythm but are not predictable, it
  grabs our attention whether we want it to or not. This is where patience and
  control comes in. Similar to Chamberlain and how the intentional focus on
  something else could have bettered his game, we must make conscious choices to
  focus our actions on what we can **control** during the annoying situations in
  our lives.


  While you’re on the bus, pick-up your own phone and call you mother. Maybe
  plug in your iPod or change seats so you’re out of earshot of the person on
  the phone. Change the aspects of the situation you can control – and the
  annoyance will take care of itself.

  ### Inattentional blindness


  > "They bugged me, but you’ve got to deal with it."- Joba Chamberlain, as
  quoted in Annoying, page 85


  There’s a story in the book about Joba Chamberlain, a rookie pitcher for the
  New York Yankees in 2007. It was game 2 of the American League Division Series
  between the Yankees and the Cleveland Indians. Chamberlain had just come into
  the game, the expectation that he could save his faltering team from losing
  the game. At first, he played as expected, creating plays and striking out
  batters, until the start of the eighth inning when everything changed.
  Unexpectedly, a swarm of insects descended on the field…gnat-like creatures
  know as midges. There were millions of them – non-biters but the sheer number
  of flying creatures was enough to put Chamberlain off his game – and the
  Yankees lost after 11 innings. “The midges got under his skin, so to speak”
  (page 85).


  According to Mark Aoyagi, a sports psychologist at the University of Denver,
  “it’s simply not possible to actively ignore something that’s irritating you.”
  (page 85). The trick is to focus on something else – something else relevant
  to the game, the situation or the person – not to try to block out the
  annoyance, but instead to choose to focus on what’s relevant. This type of
  thinking is what psychologists call **inattentional blindness**, the idea that
  you can miss things that are literally under your nose if your attention is
  focused on something else. Had Chamberlain paid closer attention to the
  catcher’s mitt, the sound of the crowd, or the eyes of the batter, he may have
  turned his attention away from the midges and back to the game, creating a
  different outcome for him and his team.


  The lesson here is intentional diversion. Focusing your attention on something
  else (rather than trying to ignore the annoyance) is key. Try it out, next
  time you find yourself on one of those situations.
f_conclusion: >-
  There’s no such thing as a Department of Annoyance Studies or anyone with the
  job title “Chief Annoyingist” in any field of study but we do know there are
  reasons people get annoyed and there are people studying why. Palca, Lichtman
  and their colleagues have barely scratched the surface of this new science,
  and still don’t have a solution to prevent getting annoyed. The inevitable
  question is “does the knowledge of what makes a super-annoyance annoying
  provide any hints on how to overcome it?” (page 243). Maybe. But until they
  find out, separating siblings using duck tape down the middle of the back seat
  seems to help. Just remember – you **do** have control over your focus and
  your actions. Make use of those accordingly.

When I was little, my sister and I would fight over how much space we each got in the back seat of the car. You know the scene…one sister slides over until she’s on the very edge of the middle line, while other sister starts whining to Mom that her sister “is coming on to my side!” The little game that would annoy the heck out of my sister and produce endless entertainment for me – that is until Mom threatened “I’ll turn this car around right now!” Sound familiar? It is these situations and the other typically annoying occasions that Joe Palca and Flora Lichtman explore in their new book, _Annoying: The Science of What Bugs Us_.

Annoyance isn’t actually a science…yet. Palca and Lichtman are exploring those sights and sounds that drive us crazy, cause us to lose our concentration and become irritated and angry at something or someone. The study of annoyance is in its infancy – no one really knows why we’re annoyed by nails on a chalk board or someone talking on their cell phone on the bus but Palca and Lichtman have some theories.
