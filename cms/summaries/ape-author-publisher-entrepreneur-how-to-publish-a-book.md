  book?"- APE: How to Publish a Book, page 4


  There’s more to self-publishing a book that just creating the content inside
  it. Even though the tools make it easy enough for your content to be public,
  there’s a lot more work to do if you want your book to get the exposure it
  deserves. And it does deserve exposure, doesn’t it? That’s why the keyword is
  ‘publish’. Otherwise, you can write it in your personal journal and fulfill
  some other purpose.


  Some of the other parts to publishing a book besides just writing it include
  editing, getting an effective book cover, distribution channels, selling it in
  the eBook format, pricing, audio and foreign language editions, marketing,
  building a personal brand, using social media, and pitching to bloggers and
  reviewers. Overlooking the details in some of these areas can cause a poor
  outcome.

  ### Launch Guerilla Marketing


  > "When people have too much money they throw launch parties, hire marketing
  and social media ‘experts,’ buy advertising, and fly around the country on
  book tours. None of this will help you sell books in a cost-effective way."-
  APE: How to Publish a Book, page 255


  One of the key aspects of self-publishing a book is that you get to do your
  own marketing. Notice I said ‘get to’. Some people think it’s a hassle, but I
  think if you create something, you should be the one who tells the world about
  it (or does the work so others will tell the world).


  Gary and Shawn list many great ideas for marketing your book at very low
  costs. They first suggest to ‘cover the earth’. That means sending a free
  eBook copy to anyone who is willing to write review for it because when people
  find your book, they’ll first look at the reviews. Start with your email
  address book, social media acquaintances, and anyone you think would provide a
  review. Then they suggest approaching some of the top reviewers on Amazon. You
  can find them by looking at reviews of similar books in your genre and finding
  reviewers with “Hall of Fame” or “Top 50 Reviewer” badges. These lists are
  also published.


  Included in APE is a guest published section by Dr. Bojan Tunguz, a top Amazon
  reviewer, who shares the best way to approach an Amazon reviewer with a
  request to review your book.


  Other marketing tactics include joining HARO (Help a Reporter Out) where you
  might get selected for an interview as an expert on your subject, using Google
  Hangouts on air to broadcast video webinars on your subject, or doing
  something fun like creating stickers, running a contest, and creating
  infographics.


  Guerilla marketing is not only fun, but an inexpensive strategy for getting
  the word out about your book. And you just never know, one or more of those
  people you reach could have a huge audience themselves and decide to tell them
  about your book. I’m hoping that’s what’ll happen with mine.


  You know you can do it too… self-publish a book. Get _APE: Author, Publisher,
  Entrepreneur_ and you’ll have all the info you need.

  ### Sell an eBook… everywhere


  > "Many self-publishers only need to use the online reseller channel."- APE:
  How to Publish a Book, page 145


  Gary and Shawn provide in-depth information about the five major online
  reseller channels: Amazon, Apple, Barnes and Noble, Google, and Kobo.


  Amazon is the gorilla in the market with its Kindle Direct Publishing, but
  knowing the benefits and limits of the other options will help you make a more
  informed decision about which service to use, if you decide to make a choice.
  You’ll get more exposure if you use multiple resellers, so there’s not much
  reason to limit yourself to one.


  Amazon royalty rates are 35% and 70%, depending on how you price your book,
  but there are other fine print details that I wasn’t aware of, like a
  ‘delivery charge’ based on the file size of your book, and how they’ll
  automatically match the price of your book on other resellers if it is lower
  (at the 35% royalty rate).


  Apple has a 70% royalty rate but you need to make sure you’re using their
  formatting system. Barnes and Noble uploads to the Nook and their royalty
  rates are 40% and 65% depending on the pricing. Google Play uses a 52% royalty
  no matter what your book price. Kobo uses 70% and 45% royalty depending on
  price.


  With e-readers and phones becoming ubiquitous, it almost doesn’t make sense to
  not have your book readable in multiple options.

> The first good reason to write a book is to add value to people’s lives. _\- APE: Hot to Publish a Book, page 4_

Everybody’s doing it.

At least that’s what it seems like. The publishing industry has been turned on its head. The tools to produce, market, and distribute a book are free and open to anyone, so of course more people are doing it.

There’s now a whole new industry of options for authors to utilize in their self-publishing journey. And that is precisely why having a comprehensive guide for the entire process is so useful. _APE: Author, Publisher, Entrepreneur: How to Publish a Book_ is that guide.

Covering details of the whole self-publishing gamut from why you should even write a book to how to do the actual writing, to uploading it to the various systems, to marketing and creating a platform for exposure, _APE_ is the complete nuts and bolts textbook. It’s even written like a textbook with lots of bullet points, lists, and sub-headings. As every chapter title starts with “How to…”, it’s the ultimate ‘how to’ book on self-publishing.

And since Gary Kawasaki and Shawn Welch have written quite a few bestselling books—both traditionally and self-published—you can trust that they know the ropes.
