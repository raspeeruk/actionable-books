  ### Create Meaning for Yourself


  > "Meaning does not happen to you—you create it. One of the most important
  elements of building a great career and life is attaching what you do each day
  to a broader mission. Until you understand how your efforts contribute to the
  world, you are simply going through the motions each day."- Are You Fully
  Charged?, page 22


  As per Tom, the three keys to living a life fully charged are meaning,
  interaction, and energy. He defines them as follows:


  *   **Meaning**: focusing on benefiting someone else rather than oneself;

  *   **Interactions**: valuing moments spent with others and focusing on the
  positive;

  *   **Energy**: choosing to eat, move, and sleep so that you are mentally and
  physically healthy.


  Although all three are equally important, the one that speaks to me the most
  and therefore the one I’ll focus on here is meaning. Since we spend much of
  our waking life at work, it is crucial to find meaning there or nothing else
  we do will allow us to be our best.

  ### Spend Time in Your Element


  > "Think back through your education and career. Identify a few instances when
  you felt such a positive charge that you lost track of time. Make note of
  exactly what you were doing and who you were with at these times. Then see if
  you can bring that into your current work and think about one thing you can do
  tomorrow to spend more time in your element."- Are You Fully Charged?, page 50


  Although helping others is necessary for meaningful life and work, you’ll be
  able to accomplish more of this if you are in your element.


  Some of us were raised believing that we can accomplish anything as long as we
  try hard enough. As Gallup has proven and Tom reiterates, this myth has led to
  many people spending years fighting an uphill battle. Why spend your life
  trying to be what you’re not instead of being more of who you are naturally?
  Why not figure out what your natural and inherent strengths are and develop
  those for the benefit of yourself and others? It’s the difference between
  going with the flow or against it: the first energizes you while the second
  enervates you.


  If you’re not sure what those strengths are, ask yourself these questions:


  *   What would I be happy to keep doing even if I never got paid for it?

  *   What are people always asking me for help with?

  *   What absorbs me so completely that I always lose track of time?


  Start noticing when you’re energized and when you’re exhausted. What are you
  doing (and/or who are you with) when you’ve got that positive charge?

  ### Your (Strengths + Interests) + Others’ Needs = Meaning


  > "You create meaning when your strengths and interests meet the needs of the
  world. Knowing your talents and passions is critical, but that is only half of
  this supply-and-demand equation. What may be even more important is
  understanding what the world needs from you and how you can productively apply
  your strengths and interests."- Are You Fully Charged?, page 38


  Apparently pursuing meaning will make you happier than pursuing happiness:
  happiness is a selfish and lonely thing while meaning requires thinking of
  someone beyond yourself. If we focus on helping others, whether in our work or
  even how we create incentive programs, we’ll actually end up better off.


  That said, it’s still important to do what you’re good at and enjoy since it’s
  really hard staying energized when you spend all your time at odds with your
  strengths and interests. But as Tom explains, it’s the third piece of the
  equation—others’ needs—that makes the difference. Not only won’t you be able
  to make a living without finding the intersection between these three
  elements, but you’ll be hard pressed to find meaning in what you do without
  knowing how it improves someone else’s life.


  And meaning need not be reserved for those with a higher calling. If you know
  what purpose you and your company serve, you can figure out a way to imbue it
  with meaning. Tom shares the story of a man who deals with commuters on a
  daily basis and has made it his purpose to make someone smile every day. Can
  you improve someone’s life, even a little bit, on a daily basis? Is that not
  meaningful?
f_conclusion: >-
  Being able to find meaning in our life and work is as beneficial to those we
  care about as it is to ourselves since our positive energy will benefit those
  we spend time with. So what better reason to find meaning, try to focus on the
  positive, get enough sleep, etc. than to help others?

  "When you are fully charged, you get more done. You have better interactions.
  Your mind is sharp, and your body is strong. On days when you are fully
  charged, you experience high levels of engagement and well-being. This charge
  carries forward, creating an upward cycle for those you care about."

Tom Rath, grandson of the late Don Clifton, was raised with an appreciation for using one’s natural strengths. While working for his grandfather at Gallup, he developed The StrengthFinder and also worked with him on the book [_How Full Is Your Bucket?_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/how-full-is-your-bucket/)

Tom suffered from health challenges when fairly young so grew to appreciate the importance of taking care of oneself and recharging. His latest book, _Are You Fully Charged? The 3 Keys to Energize Your Work and Life_ builds on all the research he did for Gallup and since, and explains the small steps we each can take to ensure we are living life at our full potential.
