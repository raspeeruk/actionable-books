  ### Leave a Legacy


  > "In my office I have a rocking chair to remind me that when I’m retired and
  sitting in that chair, and my grandchildren ask me what was important in my
  life, I won’t tell them about extra earnings per share… I’ll tell my
  grandchildren, as I tell employees, how this work has touched my own life."-
  Around the Corporate Campfire, page 140


  The idea of leaving a legacy is not new, however it is powerful and
  beautifully sums up the main reason why a business should devote some energy
  to reinforcing its core values using stories. Medtronic is a medical
  technology and services company that was established in 1949 with a mission to
  “alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.” Art Collins was the
  Chairman and CEO in 2004, and the man with the rocking chair in his office.
  Like his predecessors, Collins believed in the company’s mission and knew what
  stories people needed to be told. It should come as no surprise then to learn
  that the stories shared at Medtronic focus on the impact the company’s devices
  and technology have on the lives of the people who use them every day.


  Do your employees know what legacy your company wants to bequeath to its
  customers? Do you regularly hear (and tell) stories that demonstrate your
  corporate mission and values in action? What about you personally? Have you
  thought about the legacy you want to leave future generations? Are you sharing
  those stories with your family, friends and colleagues? If not, you might want
  to buy a rocking chair and spend some time crafting a few good stories that
  will let everyone around you know what’s important to you.

  ### Be Like Gumby


  > "To be called 'Gumby-like' is the highest compliment for any TCS employee.
  The cartoon character epitomizes the flexibility that the company expects its
  people to practice."- Around the Corporate Campfire, page 168


  I hope I’m not dating myself too much with this reference to Gumby (and if you
  haven’t heard of Gumby a quick Google search will clue you in). In short, a
  green clay animation figure that can bend any which way without breaking. If
  memory serves me well, Gumby was also a problem-solver who demonstrated great
  perseverance when confronted with challenges (typically brought about by the
  Blockheads…but I digress). _Be like Gumby_ is a reminder to me to embrace the
  inevitable challenges that I will face personally and professionally with
  perseverance and a flexible mindset.


  The Container Store (TCS) reminds their employees about this approach both
  literally and figuratively. Images of Gumby “_can be seen on the sales floor,
  in offices, on shelves and in many other places around the company.”_ They
  even have a conference room that bears Gumby’s name (and yes, it is designed
  to easily be reconfigured to suit small or large gatherings)! The book doesn’t
  say, however it wouldn’t surprise me one bit, if the company had a stock of
  Gumby _Thank You_ cards on hand to acknowledge those employees who provide
  exceptional ‘Gumby-like’ service.


  Where might you need to be more Gumby-like? Is there a cartoon or comic book
  character or perhaps a super hero that epitomizes a trait or value you’d like
  your employees to emulate? Find creative ways that you can reinforce those
  traits and values with visual reminders and cues.

  ### Shoot. Move. Communicate.


  > "A young Marine lieutenant told him the secret behind every good troop
  leader: 'Just remember three things: Shoot. Move. Communicate.'"- Around the
  Corporate Campfire, page 113


  Fred Smith, was a Marine rifle platoon leader and company commander in Vietnam
  before he established FedEx, and told a Harvard Business Review roundtable
  that ‘Shoot. Move. Communicate.’ was the best leadership advice he ever got in
  his life. At FedEx, it means be decisive. Pick a target and go for it. Don’t
  be a sitting duck – stay agile. Treat your employees like allies not like the
  enemy by giving them the information they need to achieve the objectives you
  set for them.


  I love the simplicity of these directives and agree whole heartedly with the
  FedEx CEO – it’s pretty solid leadership advice. Personally, I need to shoot
  and move a bit more to grow my business. It’s easy to stay too focused on one
  target and forget to keep moving forward. And, I need to communicate more
  frequently with my network (my allies) so they know what I’m up to and I know
  what they are working towards so we can help one another achieve our
  objectives.


  What about you? Can you apply the shoot-move-communicate directive in your
  work or personal life? Who are your allies? Which command do you need to focus
  on more? Which one is your strong suit?
f_conclusion: >-
  This book was a great reminder that stories are a powerful communication tool
  that act like bridges between people and concepts, ideas and actions.
  Memorable stories are short and to the point, and usually have a couple of
  unexpected twists – like the salmon fillets, the waffle iron, the Lear jet and
  the three cans of beans. As Clark points out in her conclusion, “_To be
  effective, a story must focus on a clear objective; and to achieve the
  objective, the story to be shared must be carefully selected, constructed, and
  delivered.”_ That said, any story, told from the heart has the power to convey
  its message and impact the listener. Stories get better each time you tell
  them, and the more you tell them the more lasting the impact.

> "The stories you tell about your past shape your future." _\- Around the Corporate Campfire, page 16_

What do salmon fillets, a waffle iron, three cans of beans, and a Lear jet all have in common? They all come from real life corporate stories told to employees to reinforce core company values and help them remember to act in alignment with those values.

Evelyn Clark profiles 15 highly successful companies that have embraced storytelling as a way to teach their employees about what is important while boosting their bottom line. As Clark states in her introduction to the book, _“To understand and appreciate what their organization stands for, workers need to hear about its people, its values, and its history. So smart leaders tell stories.”_ And like all good storytellers, Clark lets the characters in her stories take centre stage so we hear directly from CEOs and managers at companies like Nike, Costco, Southwest Airlines, 3M, Eastman Kodak and FedEX as they share their favorite stories and how those stories help engage employees and customers alike.

The stories are as varied as the companies that are profiled and Clark masterfully weaves instructional context around them all without overpowering the stories themselves. Whether you are reading this book simply to be entertained or want to learn how you can use stories in your business, you will love what this book has to offer.
