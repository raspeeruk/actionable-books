  ### The Personal Touch


  > "...there used to be a time when by using technology, companies wanted to
  seem big. Now, using technology, companies want to seem small and personal to
  their customer."- Scott Jordan, CEO of Scottevest, quoted in B-A-M!, page 134


  The thought leaders are all talking about this (Some have been talking about
  it for years): We spent years growing the retail world into a series of
  faceless corporate entities where bigger was perceived as better. Big chains
  had great coverage, which was ideal when the goal was to bring choice to the
  people. That race is over now. We have virtually limitless options for just
  about every facet of our lives. It is overwhelming, time consuming and can be
  exceptionally frustrating for people who simply want to solve a current
  problem and move on with their lives. Connecting on an individual level is
  becoming everything (again). More and more, people don’t want faceless
  corporations offering rock bottom prices. Instead, they want a customized
  solution, at a competitive price, delivered from someone who makes them feel
  special. And they will patron the establishments and businesses that provide
  them with that feeling.


  Customer service means generating more revenue when the actions and attitudes
  you take are building loyalty and repeat business. What actions and attitudes
  does your company show your customers?

  ### The Customer is NOT always right. (Then again, neither are you.)


  > "The customer may not remember the details of the transaction - what they
  said or what you did, but they will remember how they felt... and they will
  remember that feeling for a long, long time."- B-A-M!, page 50


  “Personal touch” does not mean subservient behaviour. “The customer is always
  right” is one of the myths that Moltz and Grinstead blow wide open in _B-A-M!_
  The customer is human, and therefore guaranteed to not always be right. But
  you’re human too, and subject to the same universal laws of fallibility. The
  point is that it doesn’t matter who’s right or wrong. If the purpose of a
  business is to make money, and the role of customer service in accomplishing
  that is to help the customer feel satisfied with you as a supplier, then the
  goal in customer disputes is simply to find the solution that works best for
  both parties. No finger pointing, no egos. When engaging a customer in
  conversation or conflict resolution, try to remember what the purpose of the
  conversation is; to help the customer feel more satisfied, while maintaining
  the financial integrity of the business. That’s it. Do that – enough times,
  with enough customers – and business has no choice but to thrive.


  I liked this book. Customer service has been done so many times and in so many
  ways that it’s hard to find fresh insight or material. I believe _B-A-M!_ has
  both. It’s full of applicable yet entertaining real life examples. Through
  unearthing and debunking the 19 customer service myths so many of us hide
  behind, _B-A-M!_ takes a typically softer (and often fuzzier) piece of the
  business world and gives it the “bottom line” attention it deserves. In our
  ever increasing consumer desire to have exactly what we want, when we want it,
  customer service plays a key role in elevating some companies to greatness
  (and leaving others in the dust). At 178 pages, _B-A-M!_ is definitely worth
  picking up to stay ahead of the curve.

  ### Find out what's going on


  > "If we're only speaking to the customer every time their bill is due, they
  think all we care about is money. It's a constant dialogue between the
  corporation and the customer that builds an ongoing relationship."- Manish
  Patel, CEO of Where 2 Get It, quoted in B-A-M!, page 125


  How often do you speak with your customers, and when? So often we trap
  ourselves in our ivory towers, making decisions about the direction of our
  businesses or departments without stopping to ask for the input of those who
  will be most affected by those same decisions. (That would be the customer)


  If the purpose is explained to them properly, and they feel as though their
  opinion is truly heard, most customers will be enthusiastic to be included in
  discussion about your products or services. Customer feedback can be a great
  way to engage key customers on a personal level, too. It may cost you ten
  minutes to call a customer and have a rich, meaningful conversation with that
  person. What’s the value to your company if that customer decides to remain a
  customer for another year because of that call? What’s the hard dollar return
  on that ten minute investment?


  A couple tips when calling customers for feedback:


  1.  Only ask honest questions if you want honest answers.

  2.  Be specific in your questions if you want specific answers.

  3.  Don’t be defensive. Remember, you called them.

  4.  Ask questions that are actionable. People sense authenticity. If you’re
  only calling because this article told you to, they’ll see through that. Call
  because you genuinely care, and want to incorporate their ideas into their
  customer experience where possible.

  5.  Go in humble. You may know a lot, but you don’t know everything.


  Call a customer this week. See what you learn.

Forget “because it’s the right thing to do”. Dismiss the notion that “we do it because we love our customers”. Altruism has nothing to do with it. Businesses engage in customer service because doing so generates more revenue than if they didn’t. And if it doesn’t, then the program needs an overhaul. Period.

How’s that for controversial? As a consumer, does that not rub you the wrong way in every fibre of your being? If customer service is simply a vehicle to generate additional revenue, we should be bracing ourselves for the heavy handed sales pitch, and the feeling of being “processed” by every corporation we buy from, right? Authors of “_B-A-M! Delivering Customer Service in a Self-Service World_“, Barry Moltz and Mary Jane Grinstead would argue that, no, in fact when a business realizes that their customer service should be generating at least as much revenue as it costs, it changes the corporate mentality for the better and everyone wins. The foundation of the theory is this:

_“BAM!-good customer service is defined by the attitudes and actions that a business takes to help a customer feel more satisfied.”_

_B-A-M!_, page 24

When customers feel satisfied, they come back or buy more. “Feeling” is key and feeling is personal. Ten people can feel ten different ways about a certain policy, action or attitude. Once companies realize that, they begin to incorporate a more individualized approach to customer service. When that happens, everybody wins.

“_BAM_“, for those curious is a acronym for “_Bust A Myth_“, which is precisely what Moltz and Grinstead do over the course of their quick book. They challenge and defy 19 of the popular myths of customer service, including “The customer is always right”. (But more on that later.)
