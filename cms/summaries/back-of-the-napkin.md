  ### Start With a Circle


  > "A good way to start any picture is to draw a circle and give it a name."-
  Back of the Napkin, page 146


  As mentioned, people get hung up on the “artistic” aspect of visual thinking.
  They get overwhelmed by the potential complexity of images and freeze up. A
  great way to move past the mental block is with a circle. Take out a plain
  sheet of paper and draw a circle on it, anywhere. Label the circle. Is it you?
  Your business? Your client? What other circles could you draw, and how are
  they connected? It’s amazing how drawing that initial circle can immediately
  get your creative juices flowing. Don’t get hung up on the details, your
  (supposed) lack of artistic ability or the potential complexity of your final
  puzzle. For your own sake, start drawing circles and let your brain begin to
  connect the dots.
f_conclusion: >-
  What I like about _The Back of the Napkin_ is Dan Roam’s ability to simplify
  and make actionable the core elements of visual thinking. He reminds us that
  there is nothing new about expressing ideas with pictures. We’ve simply
  forgotten the value and ease of doing so. With a few basic tools, and the
  logic behind his process, Roam teaches that we can all benefit from the power
  of visual thinking. So long as we’re willing to let our inner kindergartner
  out.
