  ### The Dynamics of Bad Leadership


  > "The mixture of the ineffective and the unethical in bad leadership can
  never be known or measured precisely. This is a truth of the human condition.
  The important tasks then are to develop a greater awareness of the dynamics of
  bad leadership, and a better understanding of the different ways that leaders’
  actions can be both ineffective and unethical."- Bad Leadership, location 665


  Kellerman has determined that bad leadership falls into seven groups:
  Incompetent, Rigid, Intemperate, Callous, Corrupt, Insular, and Evil. The
  groupings move along a spectrum that begins with incompetence and moves
  progressively into the unethical realm.


  Starting with the more benign, she itemizes conditions that lead to
  incompetence: lack of experience, lack of education, lack of expertise, lack
  of drive, lack of energy, lack of intelligence, lack of stability, lack of
  emotional intelligence. It is clear; incompetence exists primarily because
  something is lacking. Incompetent leaders can be effective up to a point, but
  would need to be willing to change when the circumstances require it if they
  wish to become effective leaders.


  Kellerman also itemizes some of the motivations that lead to bad leadership:
  power, greed, self-interest ahead of the public interest. As we move along the
  spectrum of groupings, what’s evident is a desire for more: more power, more
  money, more control, more self-interest. Kellerman concludes that leaders who
  cannot or will not control their desire for more will be bad leaders.


  The author offers examples of several well-known bad leaders, ranging from
  Juan Antonio Samaranch, the former president of the IOC whose sloppy
  management led to widespread corruption of the Olympic Games, to Radovan
  Karadzic, who personified evil leadership as the first president of the
  Bosnian Serb administration.


  I’d wager that pretty much everyone has experienced the effect of bad
  leadership of one form or another. Some of us even bear the scars of those
  experiences! And so, when reading these stories, I couldn’t help but consider
  examples from my own career. Kellerman’s analysis of bad leadership helped me
  gain insights and perspective for my own situation. In that sense, reading the
  book was, surprisingly, personally therapeutic.

  ### Lessons Learned


  > "Leaders who do not look after the interests of their followers are not only
  unethical but ineffective."- Bad Leadership, location 639


  Thankfully, Kellerman devotes a good chunk of her book to suggestions for how
  leaders can strengthen their personal capacity to be a good leader, one who is
  effective and ethical. The cautionary tales of incompetent leaders and
  terrifying tales of unethical leaders present a strong driver to pay attention
  to her advice on how to be a good leader!


  One such piece of advice is to limit your tenure within one leadership role.
  When leaders remain in positions of power for too long, they tend to acquire
  bad habits.


  Advice particularly relevant to those of us who work in a public service
  sector: Remember the mission; don’t lose sight of the mission of your
  organization. Be loyal to the whole and not to any single individual. “Share
  power. When power is centralized, it is likely to be misused, and that puts a
  premium on delegation and collaboration.” And ensure transparency, open
  discussions and meaningful participation of all members of the organization
  and its stakeholders.


  On the personal care front, Kellerman advises to stay healthy, be creative,
  and develop a personal support system. She further advises to be reflective;
  never lose sight of the importance of self-knowledge, self-control and good
  habits.


  “Balanced leaders develop healthier organizations.” They make more thoughtful
  decisions and lead more effectively.

  ### Followers


  > "We can make two important assumptions. First, when leaders commit
  atrocities and still stay in power for years on end, their followers are
  anesthetized, inflamed, or terrorized—or they are in some way rewarded.
  Second, when leaders are evil, at least some followers are also evil."- Bad
  Leadership, location 3223


  Whether _The Chronicles of Narnia_ or _Lord of the Rings_, the classic story
  arc of overcoming the monster always portrays an evil leader who threatens the
  protagonist’s homeland. The central character ultimately takes on and defeats
  the evil overlord, and yet, along the way, many evil characters are
  encountered and thwarted. The road to the primary doer of evil is paved with
  followers who are likewise evil. It’s a familiar plot.


  Kellerman makes an easily understood point: Bad leaders would be powerless
  without willing or compliant followers. And unethical bad leaders require
  followers who are also unethical and evil.


  Without followers, nothing happens, including bad leadership. Together, bad
  leaders and followers can bring out the worst in people and leave behind much
  damage.


  As Kellerman observes, “getting along by going along is one of life’s earliest
  lessons”. By and large, we want to get along, we do what we’re told and we
  play by the rules. “We follow because the cost of not following, more often
  than not, is high.” It can be the cost of job loss or demotion, reputation
  damage, or being condemned for being a whistle-blower.


  Kellerman argues that followers of evil leaders are also evil. And that even
  after evil leaders move on, their evil can remain embedded in an organization.
  If evil has become systemic, then the removal or departure of the primary bad
  leader will not resolve the problem.


  My takeaway is that moving on from an evil workplace might be the best
  strategy for survival.
f_conclusion: >-
  Kellerman posits that we promote good leadership by not ignoring bad
  leadership. To understand bad leadership, to decode and decipher it, and then
  to attack it as we would any disease is essential. She states, “If we have any
  hope of moving from bad leadership to better leadership, we must strike a
  balance between looking at the light and seeing in the dark”.

> "How did leadership come to be synonymous with good leadership? Why are we afraid to acknowledge, much less admit to, the dark side?" _\- Bad Leadership, location 193_

Reading about good leadership can be an energizing activity. It’s inspiring to think about best practices and learn from admirable leaders. In contrast, reading about bad leadership requires a strong resolve and is best not done at bedtime.

That said, Barbara Kellerman’s book provides a useful examination of bad leadership – useful in that an understanding of bad leadership and its damaging effects is necessary to really understanding good leadership. If we ignore bad leadership, how can we counter it?

_Bad Leadership_ covers the spectrum from incompetence to evil, from ineffective to unethical. It also considers context, motivations, and conditions, including the perspective of followers.

She states, “If we have any hope of moving from bad leadership to better leadership, we must strike a balance between looking at the light and seeing in the dark”.

The cost of bad leadership is extremely high. Besides the pain and suffering of those who are victimized by bad leadership, and the ripple effects on their circle of colleagues, family and friends, there is a profound and lingering impact on an organization. The systematic and intentional eradication of bad leadership should be a priority for any organization; the costs of bad leadership are that high.

Looking into the dark was a difficult exercise for me, but a useful one. It instilled in me a greater appreciation for the necessity and the light of good leadership.
