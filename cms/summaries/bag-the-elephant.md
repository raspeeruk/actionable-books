  ### Bagging an Elephant


  > "Elephants need you, too."- Bag the Elephant, page 10


  Many small business owners are aware of how much an “elephant” can mean for a
  struggling business, but they are intimidated to approach those clients and
  feel it is a pipe dream. The fact of the matter is that every elephant relies
  on smaller companies.


  “Bagging an elephant,” as Kaplan calls it, is difficult, especially if it is
  your first elephant. It requires a certain level of tenacity and grit. Kaplan
  recounts making hundreds of calls on a daily basis, noting that you have to
  treat hunting as an important activity, no matter what else is going on.


  Not only do elephants need smaller businesses, if you handle your business
  right and follow the instructions in _Bag the Elephant_, your elephant may
  just come to rely on you.

  ### Courting an Elephant


  > "Every day at my company, I’d start at the top of the list and hit the
  phones, attempting to call each entry until I reached the last one on the last
  page. Then I’d start over. There were many days when I’d make five or six
  attempts before actually speaking with the prospect."- Bag the Elephant, page
  60


  Most small business owners understand and acknowledge the importance of
  obtaining an elephant, but where should we start? Kaplan lays out a
  step-by-step plan for “making that first solid contact:”


  1\. **Build your prospect database**: Kaplan offers a variety of interesting
  methods of building your prospect database, from looking on company reports of
  publicly traded companies for the names and titles of likely decision makers,
  to calling the company’s main line and ask to be connected to the director of
  marketing (even though you will just be connected with an assistant, you can
  still get the information you are after).  

  2\. **Send an introductory mailing**: This short cover letter should quickly
  introduce yourself and your business to your prospect. It should be clean and
  minimal, yet show off what you can do for the company.  

  3\. **Make the first phone call**: After the prospect has likely received the
  first mailing, follow up with a brief phone call to gather information needed
  for future contacts or sales calls with buyers. Prepare a script and have
  goals for the conversation. Let the conversation flow naturally, but keep your
  goals in mind.  

  4\. **Send a detailed mailing**: This mailing should give the prospect
  detailed information about your services, customized to the needs of each
  prospect based on what you learned in your initial phone call. Don’t send too
  much at this point, as you don’t want to burden the prospect.  

  5\. **Make the second phone call**: After the mailing has been received, try
  to set up a meeting to present your services to the prospect and deepen your
  relationship. At this point, if you’re not able to set a meeting with your
  prospect, you can try some more creative ideas and do your best to remain top
  of mind.

  ### The Secret Life of the Elephant


  > "There are many things you have to do in order to pursue, capture, and hold
  onto your Elephant. First among these is to get your mind right."- Bag the
  Elephant, page 19


  One of the first secrets to landing a big client is to think like an elephant.
  Doing so allows you to understand your target’s motivation and predict their
  moves. Kaplan says you need to know four things about your elephant prey:


  1\. **Know who does what**: It is not just about who is the buyer. You also
  need to know who influences the buyer. Can you get a champion for your
  company? Is there anyone who can kill a project that you need to be worried
  about?  

  2\. **Know how to get on the list**: Many large companies have a preferred
  vendor list. If so, Kaplan suggests asking what steps need to be taken to get
  on that list and then doing everything you can to get on the list, separating
  yourself from your competition in the process.  

  3\. **Know the lingo**: Understanding your elephant’s language distinguishes
  insiders from outsiders. When selling to an elephant, it is crucial to appear
  as an insider. Take note of any unusual terms, nicknames, or buzzwords and
  their meanings.  

  4\. **Know the budget season**: Kaplan distinguishes the 5 phases of the
  budget cycle. It is crucial to time your proposal when your elephant makes
  decisions relevant to your product or service.

  Getting just one big client can help grow your business by generating revenue
  and by providing you with an insider’s view of the decision making process,
  brainstorming sessions, and other top-level strategy meetings that shed light
  into how elephants really work. Bagging your first elephant is the hardest,
  but bagging one will help you bag your second and continue a path of
  sustainable growth for your business.

Remember, “virtually every huge corporation needs smaller businesses as suppliers”. Someone is going to get these contracts, why not you?
