  ### “Work, work, work… or work-life balance?”


  > "Perfectionism aside, one cannot work 24/7. We all need to rest. A hobby.
  Something approximating work-life balance."- Barking Up the Wrong Tree, page
  207


  From the time he was a young boy, legendary baseball player Ted Williams knew
  he was destined for one thing. Williams pursued his dream of becoming one of
  the greatest baseball players of all time with a single minded, steely
  determination, devoting almost every second of his waking moments to improving
  his abilities. He eventually achieved greatness, but he also paid the price.
  His intense perfectionism caused irreparable damage to his personal
  relationships, namely with his wife and children. While all of us want to
  excel at whatever it is we’re devoting our lives to, most of us aren’t trying
  to be the Ted Williams of our chosen field. We simply can’t sacrifice the
  time, energy, and endure the mental and physical toll it takes to attain that
  level of greatness.


  This notion of a work-life balance is a relatively new concept. From
  1986-1996, the term appeared in the media a total of 32 times. In the year
  2007 it garnered 1,674 references. So what accounts for this surge? It’s
  probably obvious: we’re all now constantly connected to our jobs by that
  little device in our pocket that’s become like an extra appendage–our phones.
  In the past, for most members of the workforce the day ended when you clocked
  out. Now we’re constantly faced with the decision of whether we want to play
  with our kid or spend time with our significant other, or respond to the
  unceasing barrage of emails that assault us nonstop. As valiantly as we’re
  trying to win this work-life battle, it’s a struggle many of us are losing.


  As Barker reminds us, “Hours alone aren’t enough. Those hours need to be
  _hard_. You need to be pushing yourself to be better.”


  The Insights below offer two ways for you to make the most of your time and
  achieve some semblance of work-life balance.

  ### Ending Your Day On Time


  > "Unless you want to hate your job, how you end the day matters a lot more
  than you might think."- Barking Up the Wrong Tree, page 256


  Warning: this might be a little counterintuitive. So many of us have been
  inculcated with the notion that the one who arrives at the office first and is
  the last to leave is the one who climbs the ladder of success the fastest, and
  in many respects that’s true. But adhering to a set “end time” each day is a
  crucial component to achieving a work-life balance. When you fix a time to
  wrap things up each day, you make better use of the time you’ve allotted to
  get stuff done.


  A “shutdown ritual” is an important step to ensuring a successful end time.
  Part of my shutdown ritual is responding to emails. This is also the ideal
  time to jot down and schedule those outstanding items that still need
  completing in order to preempt the “rehearsal loop” that will undoubtedly prey
  on your mind if you don’t. The rehearsal loop is that the voice that repeats
  itself interminably, keeping you awake at night or distracting you during
  downtime with friends or family (you all know what I’m talking about).

  ### Ditch the To-do List and Schedule Everything


  > "Most of us use our calendars all wrong: we don’t schedule work, we schedule
  interruptions."- Barking Up the Wrong Tree, page 252-253


  Barker agrees with Cal Newport: To-do lists “are the devil’s work.” Why?
  “Because the lists don’t give any consideration to time. Ever wonder why you
  never seem to get to the bottom of that list? You can easily list
  twenty-eight-hours worth of activities for a twenty-four-hour day. You need to
  be realistic about what you can get done in the time you have.”


  So, what should we do instead? Schedule everything. As Barker points out, most
  of us tend to schedule those pesky things that interrupt our work (meetings,
  phone calls, doctor appointments, etc.) but rarely take time to block off the
  _actual_ work. “If real work is the stuff that affects the bottom line, the
  stuff that gets you noticed, the thing that earns you raises and gets you
  singled out for promotion, well, let me utter blasphemy and suggest that maybe
  it deserves a little dedicated time too.”


  Barker also advocates blocking off an hour each morning (when the majority of
  us are at our most productive) as “protected time.” Switch off your phone,
  close out of the browser with your email open, put a “Keep Out!” sign on the
  door—whatever you need to do to remain undisturbed for at least an hour.
  You’ll amaze yourself at just how much you can accomplish without anyone else
  making demands on your time.

  With its conversational style that often veers to the irreverent, Eric
  Barker’s _Barking Up the Wrong Tree_ demolishes our preconceived notions of
  success. Achieving a work-life balance is just one of the areas it tackles.
  Pick up the book and blaze your unique trail to success.

> \[In 'Barking Up the Wrong Tree'\] we’ll explode the myths, look at the science behind what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, learn what we can do to be more like them, and find out in some cases why it’s good that we aren’t. _\- Barking Up the Wrong Tree, page 3_

Eric Barker launched his successful blog [Barking Up the Wrong Tree](http://www.bakadesuyo.com/), an exploration of what the world’s most successful individuals do that’s different from you and I, back in 2009. So, it makes sense that when he decided to distill his findings into one volume, _Barking Up the Wrong Tree: The Surprising Science Behind Why Everything You Know About Success Is (Mostly) Wrong_, he’d borrow the same name. Over six chapters, Barker’s book covers the following ground:

*   _Should we play it safe and do what we’re told if we want to succeed?_
*   _Do nice guys finish last?_
*   _Do quitters never win and winners never quit?_
*   _It’s not what you know, it’s who you know (unless it really is what you know)_
*   _Believe in yourself… sometimes_
*   _Work, work, work… or work-life balance?_

What makes Barker’s book unique is that it shows both sides of the same coin. “Both angles will present their case, much like a trial,” explains Barker. “Then we’ll settle on the answer that gives the best upside with the least downside.”

This summary will focus on that most elusive of subjects: work-life balance.
