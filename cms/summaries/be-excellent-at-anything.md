  ### Find the Pulse and Ride the Wave


  > "The higher the demand, the greater and more frequent the need for
  renewal."- Be Excellent at Anything, page 51


  If you connect with one concept in the book, if you adopt just one new
  practice in hopes of impacting your ability to perform, **the idea of
  “sprints” and “waves” of work and renewal is the biggie.** Rooted in the
  understanding that our physiology operates on rhythms and pulses, the idea is
  that our bodies AND our minds are designed not for the marathons we tend to
  attempt every day, but rather for a regular “pulsing” between expenditure and
  renewal of energy**. Based on meeting the need for physical energy
  (“sustainability”), Schwartz and his team have identified 90 minutes as the
  optimum amount of time we should work before taking a renewal break.**
  Specific recommendations include mid-afternoon naps (!), exercising in the
  middle of a workday (rather than early morning or end of day), frequent
  healthy snacks to stabilize blood sugar, going to bed early to ensure
  sufficient (7 – 8 hours) sleep and taking regular vacations. Worthy of note is
  the idea that **the key to effective renewal is not how long we do it but how
  well we do it** – like anything else, we get better at it if we practice
  systematically. I personally am very much in favour of practicing sleep and
  vacationing until I’m really good at both.


  For leaders, the adoption of the “pulse” idea organizationally includes
  potentially huge culture shifts such as no longer evaluating contribution
  based on time spent, scheduling shorter meetings, creating space for lunch and
  mid-day breaks, and actually encouraging people to go on vacation (without
  staying connected to the office, because if they’re still on email they’re not
  on vacation).

  ### Use Your Whole Brain


  > "…no factor influences productivity more directly than people’s capacity for
  absorbed attention."- Be Excellent at Anything, page 36


  **How often is your automatic response “busy” when you’re asked how you’re
  doing?** If we’re constantly reacting to urgencies and stimuli, what are the
  chances we’re bringing our best intellectual and creative capabilities to
  bear? The third need that we have to meet in order to be fully energized,
  according to Schwartz, is the need for mental energy – “self-expression”.
  **The route to getting that need met involves turning off email for focus
  periods**, understanding and creating circumstances where we can work in
  “flow,” getting clear on priorities and cultivating higher quality attention.
  Developing a reflective or meditative practice can be part of increasing your
  ability to focus, as can working on your listening skills and doing creative
  exercises to work the less-used right side of your brain.


  The fourth energy need is the hardest to meet, particularly in business.
  Spiritual energy, or “significance” requires paying mindful attention to your
  values and working in alignment with those values as much as possible. Being
  part of a community helps, as does the knowledge that you’re working on
  something beyond your own self-interest. At minimum, committing to doing the
  “right” thing rather than the “expedient” or “easy” thing can support getting
  this critical and tough to meet need handled.

  ### Say Thank-you


  > "…the feeling of being personally criticized… appears to take the greatest
  toll on our bodies and on our ability to think clearly."- Be Excellent at
  Anything, page 138


  Based on research into the human response to negativity, disrespect and
  exclusion, Schwartz and his team identified the second need – emotional
  energy, or “security” – and the suggested practices for both individuals and
  organizations that can help ensure that need gets met. Awareness is the first
  step – noticing the triggers that cause physical responses to negativity such
  as rapid heartbeat, queasiness or muscular tightness. From there he suggests
  analyzing the difference between the facts of a situation and the “story” we
  tell ourselves about it, in order to discover what’s real about the threat and
  what we’ve fabricated. Extrapolate those practices into organizations and
  consider the impact of criticism, crisis thinking, territory battles and
  gossip on productivity and performance.


  Schwartz encourages direct and timely handling of difficult situations so the
  effect of stress is minimized – a practice rarely well-developed in
  organization, in my experience. Beyond that, Schwartz cites the practice of
  appreciation as being one of the key behaviour changes he encourages when
  working with executives. Connecting with our own sense of gratitude has inward
  benefits, and communicating that gratitude benefits others, making the
  practice incredibly powerful. What if you were to adopt the practice of making
  a gratitude list at the end of every day? Or sending a thank you note at least
  once a week? Schwartz suggests that these small, simple practices can be
  transformative.
f_conclusion: >-
  It would have been easy to write this summary with a dozen or more “Insights”
  – there are that many big ideas and actionable recommendations in the book.
  That said, so much of what Schwartz outlines seems so obvious and so
  necessary, it seems illogical that so many find it so difficult to live and
  work the way he suggests. So what really is in the way? And how risky would it
  be to change some of our habits towards those that have been deeply researched
  and proven to just make more sense for anyone who wants to live and work at
  their peak?

Without even citing the litany of studies and piles of data that prove it, I think we can all agree that today’s workplaces and work culture don’t set anyone up to thrive and be at their best. How many people do you know (including yourself) who “never get anything done” at the office, who are on their handheld device 24/7, who live in fear of “missing something” and who constantly feel run down, tired, stressed and lacking any kind of energy (creative, intellectual, emotional, physical)? **But if we all agree that something – everything – needs to change, how can that change happen?**

A basic principle of leadership is, in my view, **the idea that “leadership of self” must come before “leadership of others” is possible.** And that ”culture” is everyone, not just the person at the top (although their influence is critical). So what if there was a system, a collection of ideas, a “how-to” that could guide individuals towards healthier, more sustainable high performance behaviours and that could be extended into the organizations in which they work and lead, such that those same transformations occur broadly?

Enter Tony Schwartz.

I first encountered Tony’s work through [_The Power of Full Engagement_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-power-of-full-engagement/), where he and co-author Jim Loehr transform Einstein’s energy equation into a formula for professional and personal sustainability by showing us how to convert energy into productive activity. Mr. Schwartz has continued to do research into sustainable high performance and offers _Be Excellent at Anything_ as his road map for individuals and organizations seeking true competitive advantage.

Mr. Schwartz and his team have studied a variety of arenas including the arts, business, health care and law enforcement across many different cultures in numerous countries. _Be Excellent at Anything_ posits that **there are four keys to transforming the way we work and live that emerge consistently across all of those arenas and cultures** – four energy needs that must be met in order for high performance to be possible – and outlines a detailed process for understanding and addressing those needs, both for individuals and for organizations.
