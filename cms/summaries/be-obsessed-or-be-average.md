  ### Only You Are Responsible For Your Success


  > "The obsessed embrace the fact that they—and only they—are responsible for
  their success."- Be Obsessed or Be Average, page 23


  Taking responsibility for our lives is something that we all inherently know
  we need to do. While it’s often easier said than done, the point Cardone makes
  here is that until we make that shift to where we’re owning everything that
  happens around us, we’ll never be able to get to where we ultimately want to
  be. “There are billions of people on this planet living in daily emotional
  turmoil, knowing they are living and operating below their potential,” Cardone
  writes. “No one feels sorry for you. No one is going to help you.”


  While this might be tough to hear, it’s the truth. Until we’re able to control
  our own attitudes and actions towards everything that happens in our lives,
  we’re not going to achieve our full potential. Cardone says something that
  continues to stick with me and that is, “for me success is defined as the
  attainment of my potential.” That seems like a great thing to strive towards!

  ### Learn to Love Fear


  > "The greatest you will be discovered far outside your comfort zone."- Be
  Obsessed or Be Average, page 128


  The notion of fear and our comfort zone is one that, no matter what we do, we
  need to learn to embrace. If you do any reading on the topics of performance
  improvement, success, mindset, flow, etc., all the research indicates that
  growth happens just outside the reach of our current abilities. Creating the
  mindset needed to push ourselves and stretch ourselves is one that will help
  us to grow, get better, and take the necessary steps towards the results that
  we want to achieve. Cardone shares with us that to him “fear is an indication
  of what you should do, not what you shouldn’t do”. I like that paradigm, and
  if we’re able to have a similar mindset seeing discomfort and fear as an
  opportunity for us to grow, we can get out of our own way and accelerate that
  growth even faster.

  ### What to Be Obsessed With


  > "You don’t need to like what you do to love what you do."- Be Obsessed or Be
  Average, page 41


  Early in the book, I kept asking myself, this is all great, but how do I know
  or determine what my obsession is?


  What I found by asking myself the question, “Am I obsessed with this?”, was
  that I gained real clarity on a) whether or not I was obsessed with that
  particular thing and b) whether or not I _could_ get obsessed with that thing.
  Those are introspective questions that I never really had good insight into
  until reading this chapter.


  What I appreciate about Cardone’s writing style is that he poses questions to
  the reader throughout the book. Here are some questions to help you determine
  what you’re obsessed with.


  **Personal interests**


  *   What excites me now? What have I been interested in since childhood?


  **Money motivation**


  *   What am I willing to do for no money? If money had nothing to do with my
  life, what would I do with my time?


  **Skills and talents**


  *   What can I do better than anyone? What have I always been good at?


  **Inspiring people**


  *   Who are five successful people that I admire? What quality do I wish I
  shared with those people?


  **What if…**


  *   I were going to write a book, what would it be about? What inspirational
  lessons would I draw from my life?


  The major takeaway here is that there’s probably not going to be just one
  outcome. You’ll likely find that you’re “obsessed” with many things, however,
  this exercise will begin the process of more clearly identifying what those
  things are and how you might impact them moving forward.

> "To have what you want in life, you must give yourself permission to throw yourself all in on your dreams." _\- Be Obsessed or Be Average, page 20_

_Be Obsessed or Be Average_ is another in your face, motivational book by bestselling author Grant Cardone. This book discusses how being obsessed is one of the best tools we have to leverage in order to breakout from living a mediocre and average life to the one that we dream of. Cardone is an entrepreneur, real estate investor, sales trainer, consultant and public speaker whose style is both genuine and motivating.

The book is a very engaging read throughout, with many examples and stories from the author. I find Cardone’s writing style to be very effective, and if you’ve ever heard him speak, it’s like he’s right there talking to you. In each chapter he provides the reader an opportunity to answer a series of questions to help apply and relate what he is discussing to their own individual life.

_Be Obsessed or Be Average_ takes the reader on a journey, beginning with Grant Cardone’s personal story of “becoming obsessed”, and he then proceeds to take the reader down a path that will help you discover what it is you’re passionate and then build on it.
