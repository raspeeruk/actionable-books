  ### Beware of Business Atrophy: Success is a moving target


  > "There’s really no such thing as holding your position. You’re either
  gaining ground or losing ground."- Becoming a Category of One, page 18


  Every investment guide has the same disclaimer: “past performance is no
  guarantee of future performance”. According to the author, the same is true
  for business; past success means that you know what worked yesterday. “Success
  is a moving target that causes a very positive version of permanent
  dissatisfaction. It is a form of dissatisfaction that feels good because you
  are driven by the fuel of knowing you can do better.” The author encourages
  you to **create a sense of urgency every day in every thing that you do so
  that you can guard against complacency.**


  Regardless what industry you are in the marketplace has become dynamic and
  competitors are no longer confined to domestic borders. When change is
  occurring outside of your business at a rapid pace you must innovate and
  redefine your market share on a continuous basis in order to survive. Business
  owners must ask themselves, “am I willing to commit to do what it takes to be
  extraordinary?”

  ### Your Story: Give them something they can feel


  > "Your story is a simple, inspirational statement that galvanizes and unifies
  resources and that maximizes employee and customer engagement."- Becoming a
  Category of One, page 28


  **Why you and not them?** That is the question that every customer poses to
  the business owner. Why should I do business with you? Your answer to that
  question has to resonate with the customer, provide value by addressing their
  needs, and be emotionally compelling. “The single most powerful sales tool
  is…to know more about the customer going in.” The experience that you create
  with customers when you do business with them is a new competitive factor that
  goes beyond price and quality.


  What do you anchor this experience to? The answer is your core values and the
  driving purpose behind your business. Blake Mycoskie incorporated philanthropy
  into his business and established the _One for One_ global movement behind
  TOMS shoes that drove his brand to incredible heights. He understood his
  customer and delivered something they could emotionally connect to. How do you
  translate your product or service into something that is compelling?


  _Category of One_ businesses do the following things flawlessly:


  1\. Create value by solving problems or creating opportunities.  

  2\. Deliver a compelling consumer experience through creativity and
  consistency.  

  3\. Pay attention to customer needs.

  ### See your company through the eyes of your customers

  creating a difference with customers through their experience of what it’s
  like to do business with you."- Becoming a Category of One, pages 78-79


  Did you see Jay-Z’s [Samsung commercial](http://youtu.be/B--ZARCwSIE) for his
  new album, _Magna Carta Holy Grail_? The commercial offers an inside peek into
  the creative process behind the upcoming album. In the studio room with him
  are producers Rick Rubin, Swizz Beats, Timberland and artist Pharrell
  Williams. In the beginning of the ad Jay-Z explains that the album is about
  the duality of how you navigate your way through success and failures while
  managing to remain yourself. He goes on to declare that **“the Internet is
  like the Wild West; there are no rules and everyone is trying to figure it
  out.”** Jay-Z then tells the room of musicians, “We need to write the new
  rules”. And that is exactly what Jay-Z is doing. According to an article in
  the _Wall Street Journal_, Samsung purchased 1 million copies of Jay-Z’s new
  album for $5 and plans to give them to Samsung Galaxy owners for free 72 hours
  prior to the album release.


  In a world where all smart phones do amazing things and all musicians produce
  quality music that their fans adore, you have to “find points of genuine
  differentiation…beyond the expected factors of price, quality, and service” if
  your intent is to endure. When Samsung, the number two smartphone market
  leader teamed up with Hip-Hop’s second wealthiest music mogul, Jay-Z, they
  began creating new rules in the marketplace and found a way to transcend being
  a commodity by creating a new customer experience. Google Play offers the app
  for Jay-Z’s new album, which is exclusively for Samsung Galaxy S 4, Galaxy S
  III, Galaxy Note II users. The app contains the new album and never before
  seen footage on the inspiration behind the album’s tracks. Talk about a
  dynamic customer experience!

  Joe Calloway refocuses the business owner’s thought process by outlining
  action steps that one can take to boil down their brand’s message to something
  simple and emotionally compelling. He offers viable case studies of businesses
  that have clearly drawn their own mark in the sand. Deliberate action that is
  customer focused is the key to becoming a _Category of One_ company.

> "Nothing of substance will take place without commitment." _\- Becoming a Category of One, page 12_

It has been said that there were more millionaires created during the Great Depression than any other time in American history. In a crisis there is opportunity, and **those that defy conventional wisdom will deliver great success out of adversity.** In his book, _Becoming a Category of One: How Extraordinary Companies Transcend Commodity and Defy Comparison_, Joe Calloway provides an insightful look into what it takes to create new levels of success despite changing market conditions and adversity. He explains that being extraordinary is a deliberate decision that must be recommitted to again and again.

Industry crises present crossroads that may force a company to expand their definition of themselves and clarify their commitments. These moments of crisis and clarity also give birth to opportunities for companies to separate themselves from the competition.
