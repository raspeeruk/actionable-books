  ### The Tools In Your Coaching Tool Box: A Blueprint


  > "A Coach comes in and helps them to see even more possibilities ... helps
  them make additional changes that will enable them to benefit even more ...
  ask the right questions and clarify and recall their conviction ... \[which\]
  will assist them to change their habits so that they can become even more
  successful and purposeful."- Becoming a Coaching Leader, page 39


  Harkavy sees the role of a coach as being a combination of multiple roles,
  each with different abilities and strengths. The ‘coach’ is not just resigned
  to a singular skillset of counselor or teacher or trainer or consultant or
  mentor or coach. Instead, he believes the skills enjoyed by each of these
  roles needs to be encompassed within a great coach. Sometime you are one,
  sometimes you are another, so it is important to have all the skills necessary
  to support and grow your clients or team members.


  So, what makes a GREAT coach? According to Harkavy, great coaches have
  mastered the following eight core competencies:


  1.  **Discernment** – “the ability to see what is not visible, to understand
  what is not being said.”

  2.  **Conviction driven** – great coaches have deep convictions about the way
  things should be done.

  3.  **Accountability** – which enables a coach to provide the necessary
  follow-up and encouragement in order to help people achieve what they want to
  accomplish.

  4.  **Uses systems effectively** – tracking is essential in coaching, so
  having the ‘right’ system for accountability, for note taking, for follow up,
  for encouragement is imperative.

  5.  **Communication** – the ability to listen, to question and to envision and
  then to communicate in a clear, concise way to the client what needs to be
  done.

  6.  **Self-discipline** – consistency in the coach’s behaviour as well as the
  client’s is imperative in order for the client to succeed. “Our convictions
  drive our disciplines.”

  7.  **Vision oriented** – the coach needs to have the ability to see what a
  client can become as well as the qualities, abilities and experiences that
  will enable success.

  8.  **Leadership** – for Harkavy, great coaches are great leaders. People must
  be willing to follow you to be successful.


  When Harkavy contrasts good coaches and great coaches, it all comes down to
  great coaches providing opportunity for what can be and leading people “boldly
  and positively into the future.” I loved his idea to coach with passion in
  order to have more successes!

  ### Schedule Your Day ... or They Will


  > "If you don't identify your top priorities and schedule your day around
  them, at the end of the day you'll always find yourself using leftover space
  to cram in what you consider important. And you know the worst thing? That's
  usually exhaustion time."- Becoming a Coaching Leader, page 118


  This partly relates to insight #1. As a coach, once you have identified the
  important parts of your life—and that does include the work aspect—set up your
  day for success. One of Harkavy’s suggestions is to know your hourly wage; are
  you working on something that should be done by someone in your pay scale or
  should it be passed on to someone else while you work on more important work?
  People will put lots of demands on your time; you need to decide which things
  require _your_ attention.

  ### The Coaching Leader's Most Valuable Tool: Your Life Plan


  > "While some good undoubtedly comes from goal setting, I much prefer life
  planning. When you choose life planning, you understand that every decision
  you make will enable you to either increase or decrease your net worth – not
  in dollars and cents alone, but in every part of your existence."- Becoming a
  Coaching Leader, page 58


  This idea differed the most from other coaching books I have read. Here
  Harkavy speaks to the need to assess where you are in life right now and what
  are the most important aspects. He then has you write a vision for each area
  along with strategies to increase “your net worth in each area”. These areas
  may include your life with your partner, your children, and your health –
  whatever matters to you. Harkavy suggests you spend a minimum of eight hours
  doing this particular exercise. This is to be done without anyone else around,
  not while you are answering emails or drafting proposals. This is solid
  ‘thought’ time. He has walked away from business clients who didn’t want to
  start here and instead wanted to dive into the ‘business’ planning side of
  things.


  After completing your life plan, you start to schedule time to follow through
  on the strategies you have identified to help you with each aspect of your
  life. You are to use your life plan to form the bones of next week’s schedule
  \[see insight #2\]. And this life plan is not a secret – share it with those
  around you, for both support as well as affirmation of what is important to
  you.

  Harkavy quotes the legendary coach of the Dallas Cowboys, Tom Landry, who once
  said, “A coach is someone who tells you what you don’t want to hear and has
  you see what you don’t want to see, so that you can be who you’ve always known
  you could be.”

  "The way to enjoy success yourself is to focus on the success of those around
  you, by making THEIR success YOUR mission. Help them to figure out how to win
  both in their career and in life, and you will enjoy both success and
  significance."

In his book _Becoming a Coaching Leader_, Daniel Harkavy wants to provide leaders within an organization the opportunity to become great coaches. It doesn’t matter your title, manager, director or VP, you are already a coach so why not become a great one? In order to develop and grow those employees around you, Harkavy gives more than the what and why but more of the how to become a coaching leader. The entire book encompasses the coaching sessions his business would provide you if you hired his group to come to your organization. This book allows you to transform both your personal as well as professional life along with that of your team.

Each chapter ends with a summary of all the key benefits of implementing the ideas and strategies previously discussed in the chapter, which allows the reader a straight forward, to-do list for execution. The benefits are divided into those for your team members, as well as your organization or company as well as how the skills will help you as an individual. Often the reinforcement of multiple benefits for a variety of stakeholders is part of the drive to make the necessary changes in our habits to go from good to great. This book will have a positive impact for both team members, the company as a whole and the coach leading his people into impactful change!

The question is: do you want to be a good coach or a great one?
