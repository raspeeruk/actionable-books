  ### Be a Human, Not a Robot


  > "The system that promotes humans based upon technical competence and expects
  them to inspire and manage other humans is failing to drive up employee
  engagement and ultimately create an environment for humans to go the extra
  mile."- Being Human, page 5


  The problem is clear—too many organizations rely on outdated models and
  hierarchies that promote based on technical competence, not management
  aptitude. Furthermore, within those rigid hierarchies, any team leader who
  dares to adopt a more human approach, can be viewed with jealousy or
  suspicion.


  LeBusque identifies seven steps to more human management:


  1.  Change walk the plank to provide a safety net

  2.  Change confusion reigns to provide clear purpose

  3.  Change authority rules to create more acts of leadership

  4.  Change speak when asked to listen and learn

  5.  Change work defines you to balance is critical

  6.  Change pigeon-holed to unlock potential

  7.  Change constant state of distress or comfort to stretch to learn


  Each of these steps have the same central message at their core: treat people
  like human beings. Robotic behaviors can be rooted out, but it takes a
  deliberate effort to build a culture where humanity is embraced. Take the
  notion of walking the plank: does your culture have a sink or swim mentality?
  Are your team members so terrified of making an error, and being forced to
  walk the plank, that they never feel safe to offer new ideas? If so, you
  likely have a team of robots, not human beings.

  ### The First 5 Questions


  > "The trick to building trust early in the new relationship is to give the
  floor to an individual to allow them to tell their story before they have to
  listen to yours."- Being Human, page 91


  LeBusque provides a five question framework that he uses to get to know new
  members of his team. While the questions themselves provide a helpful roadmap
  for the conversation, the value of this process really lies in the act of
  making time to really get to know people, before they start changing
  themselves to fit into a perceived mold, or set of behaviors that are viewed
  as the norm. You give people space to tell their own story, not to simply tell
  you what they think you want to hear. The five questions are:


  1.  What do you expect of me?

  2.  What is your work style preference?

  3.  How do you maintain balance?

  4.  What do great leaders do?

  5.  What are your most important values? Why?


  LeBusque recommends setting aside 90 minutes, and using the 70/30 ration for
  this conversation: the leader should listen 70% of the time, and speak 30%.
  This allows enough room for your team member to take charge of the
  conversation and share freely about themselves, with enough support and
  dialogue to keep the conversation moving forward productively. I love this
  tactic for more human management—it’s simple enough to do today (go and put it
  in your schedule, I’ll wait), and yet the effects of creating strong bonds,
  understanding the humans who make up your team, and developing a safe and
  trusting environment, can be profound and lasting.

  ### Trust is Essential


  > "You see, many managers have ‘capability’ as their trust killer. This is a
  selfish view based on how they would be viewed by others if one of the team
  members failed to deliver due to an issue with capability or competence. It
  completely removes any form of experimentation, challenge or innovation, as
  everyone looks to play a safe fame. It produces more robots and fewer
  humans."- Being Human, page 64-65


  LeBusque identifies three components to a trusting relationship:


  *   **Motive:** do you have my back?

  *   **Capability:** can you do the job?

  *   **Reliability:** do you do what you say you will?


  He goes on to explain that motive is his most important element—do you have my
  back? If this element is not present in a working relationship, the other two
  components won’t get you very far. When you know, without a doubt, that your
  manager has your back and is working in your best interest, you have the
  freedom to offer up new ideas and solutions. If, as a manager, you know that
  your team supports you, and are motivated to provide great results, you can
  spend less time monitoring progress on deliverables, and more time soliciting
  new ideas and creative approaches to solving problems.


  I once worked for an organization with a low degree of trust in their
  employees (and with a low degree of trust in senior leadership). The culture
  was tight-lipped, and a bit adversarial. At one point, I needed to access a
  library resource to help me complete a research project. When I asked my
  managers for permission to work off-site for an afternoon, they approved—but
  only after double checking that I was telling the truth about the database,
  and a whole bunch of jokes about how I should enjoy my afternoon off, asking
  if the library was code for the bar, and letting me know my “little field
  trip” was a privilege. It was clear that they barely trusted me. Those “jokes”
  didn’t help my already waning levels of engagement, and let me know that they
  didn’t really value new ideas.


  The exact opposite is true at Actionable—I am trusted to do my work, when and
  where I will be most effective. I don’t need to ask permission to go to the
  library (or do my laundry, or go for a run, or take a break), I manage my own
  schedule. And though there are many factors that contribute, in this
  environment I am a highly engaged employee. I know that my managers, senior
  leadership team, and teammates all have my back. And I have theirs.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Being Human_ starts with a simple, but profound observation: we call
  ourselves human _beings_, but we spend most of our time _doing_. Robots do
  things, humans _are_. It’s time to flip the script, from doing our work (doing
  performance reviews, doing deals, doing back to back meetings), to being more
  fully human in our work (being present, being collaborative, being authentic).
  As LeBusque demonstrates in _Being Human_, the results from such an approach
  can come quickly—and he’s not just talking about feeling good at work, he’s
  talking about improved business outcomes across the organization.

> "My strategy is that my people will be happy and have fun." _\- Being Human, page 14_

In _Being Human: Why Robots Are Not the Answer to Business Success,_ Mark LeBusque makes a clear and compelling argument for more human management practices. Too often, organizations reward robotic behavior—follow the policy, hit the numbers, punch in and out on time. This over-reliance on process and control, that was adopted to support antiquated business models, is eroding happiness _and_ productivity in the workplace. LeBusque’s solution is deceptively simple: he treats people like human beings. He tells the reader about how this simple wisdom has helped him lead teams that were smashing through targets (and were happy while doing so).
