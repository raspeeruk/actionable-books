  ### The Pursuit of Perfection


  > "But on the whole, tho’ I never arrived at the Perfection I had been so
  ambitious in obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was by the Endeavor a
  better and happier Man than I otherwise should have been if I had not
  attempted it"- Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography, page 90


  Lexus gets it. So much so that they’ve branded their entire business around
  the idea: _Lexus, the pursuit of perfection._ The pursuit. Not the attainment.
  The journey, not the final destination. Franklin not only spends a great deal
  of time _discussing_ the pursuit of perfection (both of morals and of
  reputation), but truly embodies the _spirit_ of the chase. Every major
  accomplishment for which he is remembered is the outcome of a desire to
  improve – to improve himself, his community and the world at large. By his own
  admittance, he fell short on most (if not all) occasions of attaining
  _perfection_ but, as he realizes in later life, the pursuit was all that
  really mattered anyway. In his constant, daily determination to make himself
  and his world better, he accomplished more than most of us could ever imagine.
  And he did so with a sense of humility, service, and adventure.

  ### Social Insulation


  > "…in the Autumn of the preceding Year I had form’d most of my ingenious
  Acquaintances into a club for mutual Improvement, which we called the Junto."-
  Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography, page 59


  Here’s the caveat to dreaming big: chances are if your dream is big enough,
  you won’t be able to accomplish it on your own. As Keith Ferrazzi taught in
  [**_Who’s Got Your
  Back_**](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/whos-got-your-back/) – you need
  a team. You need to surround yourself with like-minded, big picture thinkers
  who will propel you to greatness.


  One important piece that Franklin adds to Ferrazzi’s case that a team is
  essential to success as the “sounding board” element of a trusted group.
  Before every major idea of Franklin’s was shared with the public, or lobbied
  in parliament, it was first shared, discussed and amended by his mastermind
  group, his “Junto”.


  Just like a “great idea” at 3am can pale when reviewed in the light of day, so
  can a concept in your head lose value or passion when shared with the public.
  Having a safe environment in which to test your ideas can be a brilliant way
  to insulate yourself from the “croakers” of the world. Not only does a
  “sounding board group” protect you from public embarrassment, it also gives
  your ideas a place to flourish before being attacked by the harsh critics of
  the world. The lesson here – bounce your ideas off someone you _trust_ before
  you take it to someone you want to _pitch_.

  ### Unanimous is Boring (and Ineffective)


  > "There are Croakers in every Country always boding its Ruin. Such a one
  lived in Philadelphia, a Person of note, an elderly Man, with a wise look… Had
  I known him before I engag’d in this business, probably I never should have
  done it."- Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography, page 58


  As Franklin learned early in life (and you most likely already know), there
  will always be doubters. Always. Even 300 years ago, in an unsettled land of
  adventure and opportunity, there were people waiting to tell those willing to
  take chances that failure was just around the corner. In fact, doubters are so
  common in the lives of great leaders that if you find that your ideas meet
  with unanimous agreement, chances are your idea is going to fizzle. True
  success comes to those who dream big. True abundance comes to visionaries who
  can see further than most; those who see a better alternative just on the
  other side of a little work. And since many can’t (or aren’t willing to) see
  as far, they will doubt the viability of your dream.


  Push your dreams a little beyond what’s “acceptable”. As Robin Sharma says,
  “If people aren’t laughing at you, you’re not dreaming big enough.”
f_conclusion: >-
  _Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography_ has been referred to as the original
  personal development book and, having now read it, I can say I fully
  understand why. In addition to (and perhaps the cause of) his many varied and
  splendid accomplishments, Benjamin Franklin was a man dedicated to
  improvement, starting with his own character. His book is filled with tangible
  personal development activities and programs he created and tested; programs
  that would be worth exploring today. That a man’s self-recollection would live
  on this long, in the popularity it has, is a testament to the public’s respect
  for Franklin’s character and the timelessness of his message. _Benjamin
  Franklin: The Autobiography_ is a classic in every sense of the word.

One of the great icons of American history, Benjamin Franklin is a fascinating and timeless individual. Through the pages of his autobiography, he teaches the value of character, the satisfaction of constant improvement and basic financial lessons that are as applicable in today’s world as they were in the eighteenth century.

While he is perhaps best known for his experiments with electricity (most remember the kite) or his involvement in the formation of the United States of America (the only person to sign the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Treaty Alliance with France, and the Treaty of Peace with England), Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography is of a much less grandiose nature than his myriad accomplishments. _Benjamin Franklin: The Autobiography_ is the 171 page musings and recollections of a great man about the specific path and choices he took that ultimately led to his success. While not a single one of the choices made was large enough to make a lasting impact on his life and legacy, Franklin instead imparts a mindset that, when followed, is destined to create nothing short of lasting excellence.
