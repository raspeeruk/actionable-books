  ### The Right Fit


  > "…it may even be time for you to turn your organization upside down. Give up
  central control and embed innovation in every crevice. Innovation is for the
  people and by the people. When you treat your employees as owners of the
  business, you will find that they take the initiative to innovate."- Best
  Practices Are Stupid, page 127


  Hiring the right people is one of the cornerstones to building a successful
  business that will endure and flourish. As even the best hiring managers will
  attest, however, finding the right person to complement a team can be a lot of
  guess work.


  _Will they get along with the existing team?  

  Do they have the skill set necessary to not only competently complete their
  job each day, but also rise above what’s expected of them?  

  Do their beliefs mesh with the business’s philosophy?_


  While these questions can be difficult to answer during a traditional
  interview, Shapiro reminds us of their importance. After all, “Your people
  **are** your culture.” An innovative attitude and spirit begets innovation, so
  it’s crucial to consider how the culture will be affected when looking for
  someone to complement your team. To inspire innovation at every level, Shapiro
  says, “treat your employees as owners of the business.” Make them feel as
  though they have a vested interest in the results of effective innovation, and
  make sure they understand that their opinions count and are required.

  ### Allocate Appropriately


  > "One way to make time is to get your knowledge workers doing knowledge
  work."- Best Practices Are Stupid, page 149


  Years ago, when Stephen Shapiro was working for a computer manufacturer, his
  supervisor was laid off and he had to pick up the slack. He was essentially
  working two jobs, which meant (at first blush) that he would have to go from
  working 50 hours a week to a mind boggling 110. How on earth was he supposed
  to find _additional_ time to innovate? Rather than mindlessly trying to
  complete the obscene workload, Shapiro spent a weekend scrutinizing the tasks
  he would have to complete in these 110 hours. In doing so, he realized that a
  mere “20 percent of my work was high value-add. These were the high-priority
  items I still needed to perform.” Of the other 90 hours, he realized that
  there were certain tasks that he felt weren’t beneficial, and so he just
  stopped doing them. (He didn’t tell his higher ups, and they didn’t seem to
  take any notice.) But more importantly he realized that some of the tasks that
  fell under his umbrella “were really the responsibility of another department
  or individual.” This combined realization – the work that could stop, plus the
  work that was misallocated – allowed him to shaving 90 hours off his workload,
  and made the entire team more efficient as a result. And, as his team was
  assigned new tasks, they became more knowledgeable and focused, and therefore
  more likely to innovate.


  Get your high-value knowledge workers doing high-value knowledge work. For
  instance, sales representatives are often bogged down doing work that could
  easily be someone else’s responsibility. Shapiro estimates that only 25% of
  the average sales persons time is being spent on high-value tasks. This could
  easily be doubled to 50% by reassigning the various tasks that are wasting
  their time. This would leave room for high-value activities (or what Shapiro
  refers to as “knowledge work”), allowing innovation to become a priority _and_
  a reality.

  ### Avoid the Cult


  > "Is your organization a cult? In other words, is your culture so strong that
  it encourages everyone to think the same way? Maybe it’s time to hire people
  who don’t ‘fit the mold.’"- Best Practices Are Stupid, page 127


  In business, as in life, we often surround ourselves with people who think the
  way we do. It makes us feel comfortable, safe. However, in a business context,
  building a team of like-minded individuals can be a hindrance to innovation
  and long-term success. Shapiro likens this to establishing a cult where
  everyone espouses the same beliefs of their nefarious leader. To avoid this,
  we have to let go of the safety net that is like-mindedness and surround
  ourselves with a team of people who challenge why we think the way we do;
  people who aren’t afraid to shoot down an idea if they don’t like it. What’s
  one way to do this? Hire people you don’t like! Shapiro suggests keeping the
  following mantra in mind when hiring: “The person you like the least is the
  person you need the most.”


  When we work in teams that are all on the same wave length, problems can often
  be solved in a short amount of time, especially in what Shapiro calls “low
  difficulty” situations. However, in a study of thirteen teams, the teams
  comprised of people with divergent backgrounds, opinions, etc. innovated more
  effectively in “high difficulty” scenarios.


  “Innovation demands diversity of perspectives, disciplines, and
  personalities,” says Shapiro, “Having a group of people who think the same way
  only gives you more of the same. Having people on your team who get along well
  may seem easier, but it will rarely lead to new and innovative ideas.”


  When you hire someone who sees the world differently, or work with someone who
  has a divergent opinion, you may be annoyed by them when you’re trying to
  innovate. Shapiro would argue that this is a good thing. The contrarian
  thinkers are actually complementing your own skill set, and allowing your team
  to strike a better balance, making innovation possible. Also in that vein,
  when hiring, Shapiro suggests hiring two people with complementary skill sets.
  For example, if you’re hiring someone that is very creative, also hire someone
  who thinks more analytically. With this type of thinking, you’ll have all of
  your bases covered and innovation will be more effective.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Best Practices Are Stupid_ is an important and worthy addition to any manager
  or team leader’s business book library. Despite the fact that Shapiro’s latest
  book doesn’t come packaged with a fun game, the 40 tips, organized into the
  five categories are easy to understand and make actionable. “These tips are
  designed to help you innovate differently,” Shapiro writes in the
  introduction. “Innovate more efficiently. Innovate in a more focused manner.”
  And I, for one, believe they do just that.

**Innovation** and **people** are the air that author Stephen Shapiro breathes. In _Personality Poker_, he ingeniously integrated a card game into his book, creating a practical tool that helps determine how to best utilize the skills of team members to ensure innovation, job aptitude, and workplace happiness. After all, when we’re suited to a job, we usually excel.

In his follow-up book, _Best Practices Are Stupid_, Shapiro wants you and your team to start “innovating the way you innovate.” Shapiro is an advocate for a “less-is-more” approach when it comes to innovating. As he writes, “the key to innovating _successfully_ involves innovating _efficiently_.”

_Best Practices are Stupid_ and its 40 tips are divided into five “components of innovation capability,” which are **process**, **strategy**, **measures**, **technology**, and **people**, the latter of which will be the focus of this summary.
