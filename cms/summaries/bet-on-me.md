  ### Beiber’s not the only Canadian with a Purpose Tour


  > "You make your decisions right by adhering to your values and then executing
  them well."- Bet on Me, page 47


  The author has built a reputation and legacy of kindness, honesty, and
  fairness, through purposeful and consistent results. The core of this stems
  from her upbringing and childhood, but also her unwavering determination to
  not lose sight of her values. Ego in check. The start of the book talks about
  finding your baseline, your core values, your true self, whatever you want to
  call it, that reminds you of who you are and what you want to be. I know this
  sounds soft, but it really is the foundation that allowed the author to take
  risks, ask for what she wanted, believe in herself, say no, say yes, have hard
  conversations, and make even harder decisions. Getting clear on what the
  author refers to as your baseline, and trusting your gut instinct, is the
  first step towards becoming and staying a successful leader. Verschuren speaks
  frequently about not taking the easy path and making the right decision, not
  the easy one. She did this successfully because she didn’t waiver or back down
  from her values and the type of leader she proudly wanted to be (and quite
  frankly is).

  ### Don’t Get in the Way of Yourself


  > "Sometimes the pursuit of the perfect sequencing of events can prevent you
  from taking the actions that will deliver the results you are looking for. One
  way to get around this is to make it about the outcomes you are pursuing."-
  Bet on Me, page 85


  I love this gem because I often feel that business related books focus more
  heavily on how to approach problems through the lens of process, instead of
  emphasizing the importance of producing outcomes. The author suggests that if
  you are in a leadership role (upper management) you should spend at least
  eighty percent executing and twenty percent planning. This isn’t to discount
  thoughtful decision making, but rather placing importance on building strong
  relationships and communication with your team and stakeholders in order to
  ensure you will execute well. Using the three actionable steps from Gem #1
  (involve, delegate, recognize) will set you up for success whether you’re a
  proposing a new idea or rolling out significant change management.

  ### Get the Monkeys Off Your Back


  > "Resist the urge to do other people’s thinking for them – even if it feels
  like the quickest route."- Bet on Me, page 146


  The author gives an example of someone who performs really well individually.
  A doer. The results gets them recognition and ultimately a promotion. They
  become a manager and now are responsible for leading results through a team.
  Issues come up, problems occur, and they find themselves in a situation where,
  for some reason, they have a considerably increased workload, or they can’t
  seem to get enough work consistently out to their team. It is easy for this
  individual to rely on their “doer” skills when the going gets tough (aka ‘I’ll
  do it myself’). What needs to happen, as quoted by business consultant William
  Oncken Jr., is to learn the very important skill of getting the ‘monkeys off
  your back’ and putting them back onto your team where they came from. The
  author gives three specific ways to do this:


  1.  Involve: Your team in decisions making, planning, and feedback to allow
  them to take ownership.

  2.  Delegate: If you’re doing the above correctly, delegating will come more
  naturally. Teams will know the vision and expected outcome.

  3.  Recognize: Praise both results and effort equally.


  Using these three tactics will put the leader back in a position to devote
  their time to leadership development activities. Less time will be spent
  managing individual tasks (or monkeys), as the team will be more engaged and
  involved.

  _“My focus in this book, however, was not on business strategies, but on
  people strategies. And not on many strategies, but one in particular: the
  strategy of being yourself and letting your true humanity shine through.” —

f_quote-2: >-
  “I was reminded that great leaders don’t fixate on being bad or good. They
  focus first on being better. Focusing on being better is the first step in
  effective tangible positive change. And getting results is what ultimately
  gives a leader her power.”

> “I was reminded that great leaders don’t fixate on being bad or good. They focus first on being better. Focusing on being better is the first step in effective tangible positive change. And getting results is what ultimately gives a leader her power.” _\- Bet on Me, page 27_

This summary comes on the eve of arguably one of the most unprecedented and historical American elections, where for the first time a female president could be elected. With that as the backdrop to my nightly reading it is with no surprise that this book has profoundly taken ahold of me. I have to admit rather embarrassingly I had never heard of Annette Verschuren before seeing her book as a suggested top summer read by the WXN Network. This book is a top read for all business leaders, at every level, and particularly for women. Verschuren is a wildly successful business leader in Canada who very candidly lays out the foundation to her success in an incredibly relatable and tangible manner. This is a book of gems: page after page of practical and actionable advice demonstrated through personal story. There is no sugar coating in here, just straight up real talk. I hope the gems below will do it justice!
