  ### Know Yourself (and your Tendency)


  > "We can build our habits only on the foundation of our own nature."- Better
  than Before, page 257


  What works for one person, may not work for the next. We all know this to be
  true, but Gretchen Rubin makes it strikingly obvious that habit formation must
  be highly individualized in order to ensure long-term sustainability. She
  notes that our individual approaches can be linked to the type of
  accountability we require and the sliding scale of value placed on
  expectations of self and others. Rubin has dubbed these The Four Tendencies_:_


  **Upholders:** _“They want to know what’s expected of them, and meet those
  expectations”_ (18). These folks have little trouble forming habits as they
  are highly accountable to their own wants and needs, as well as those around
  them. They are dependable and actionable, and struggle most when expectations
  are unclear.


  **Questioners:** _“Questioners question all expectations and they respond to
  an expectation only if they conclude that it makes sense. They’re motivated by
  reason, logic and fairness” (19)._ When it comes to habit formation,
  Questioners are very keyed into the cause and effect of the desired outcome.
  Does it align with their personal values and the ultimate goal? If so, sign
  them up. If not, they want no part of a foggy promise.


  **Obligers:** _“They’re motivated by external accountability; they wake up and
  think ‘what must I do today?’ Because Obligers excel at meeting external
  demands and deadlines, and go to great lengths to meet their responsibilities”
  (21)._ Obligers excel in habit formation that is directly tied to the
  expectations of others, whether it is the physical presence of meeting a
  running buddy, or the theoretical ‘eyes’ enacted upon announcing a goal and
  owing a outcome, the debt of completion weighs heavy on these folks and can
  serve as strong motivation.


  **Rebels:** _“They choose to act from a sense of choice, of freedom. Rebels
  wake up and think, ‘What do I want to do today?’” (23)._ The very idea of a
  habit is simply too restrictive and rigid for a Rebel, they often lack any
  desire for predictability or forecasted behaviors. Rubin does explain that
  Rebels can adapt to habit-like behavior if we remove the daily requirement and
  add the choice of participation, day after day. From ‘I have to do this
  everyday’, to ‘I can choose to do this today.’


  By knowing your tendency, you can best approach your goals and resolutions in
  a way that plays to your strengths and protects against your inherent
  challenges.

  ### Honing and Demanding Clarity


  > "Two kinds of clarity support habit formation: clarity of values and clarity
  of action. The clearer I am about what I value, and what action I expect from
  myself- not what other people value, or expect from me- the more likely I am
  to stick to my habits."- Better than Before, page 223


  It is strikingly obvious that the key here is being true to yourself, your
  tendencies and your own, very personal desires. When it comes to setting
  goals, shaping habits, and maintaining momentum the more aligned it is with
  your most honest self-actualization, the easier it will be to adhere to. On
  the flip side, if you are looking to kick a habit that is closely aligned with
  your identity, the roadblocks and barriers will be plentiful. Know yourself,
  and proceed accordingly, when we do so we “make it easy to do right, and hard
  to go wrong” (152).

  ### Applying Strategies for Habit Success


  > "I \[We\] should tailor my habits to the fundamentals aspects of my \[our\]
  nature that aren’t going to change."- Better than Before, page 32


  Now that you know your tendency, Rubin explores strategies of habit formation
  and maintenance that can be applied in three distinct ways: getting started,
  building and maintaining.


  **Getting Started**: Rubin identifies three unique strategies that could
  support the initial process of habit formation:


  *   _First Steps:_ Just starting can be harder than continuing, and starting
  small can be the trick. Additionally, starting small can help in building
  momentum—propelling us into a long-standing habit.

  *   _Clean Slate:_ This strategy is all about capitalizing on a fresh start;
  whether it’s a new job, a new city, a new gym or a new romantic partner. Using
  the clean slate as an opportunity to start over, do better and be better than
  before.

  *   _Lightning Bolt:_ While rare, there are occasions that strike with
  invaluable motivation for change or a desire for more. Drawing on this
  lightning bolt of motivation can be just the start you need to work towards
  your new goals.


  **Building:** These Pillars of Habits are invaluable foundational strategies
  to be applied based on your natural tendencies and unique circumstances:


  *   _Monitoring:_ Having a benchmark and tracking success, with real facts can
  be crucial to finding success in your habit formation. Don’t rely on your own,
  qualitative assessment.

  *   _Foundation:_ When starting your habit journey, get back to basics and
  zone in on the key areas that are important to you and where you’d like to see
  improvements. Rubin highlights her journey with habits related to sleeping,
  moving, eating and simplicity.

  *   _Scheduling:_ If it isn’t on the calendar it doesn’t exist… and doesn’t
  get done. Actively inputting key behavior triggers to sparking commitment day
  after day.

  *   _Accountability:_ Just having it on the calendar doesn’t guarantee that
  the tasks will be completed. But for some tendencies, namely Obligers, setting
  up accountability measures can be invaluable.


  **Maintaining:** As momentum builds, forecasting potential pitfalls and
  roadblocks can be the difference between success and failure. Rubin has
  identified eight strategies for managing ongoing desire, ease and excuses:


  *   _Abstaining:_ Are you an all or nothing type of person, or a square of
  chocolate a day kind of person? For some, abstaining from certain behaviors or
  consumption habits can be just what is needed to ensure long term adherence
  and for others moderation works like a charm. Identifying which applies best
  to you can help in maintaining your desired habit.

  *   _Convenience vs. Inconvenience:_ Making adhering to desired habits easy by
  removing barriers and roadblocks or playing to your laziest self can be just
  what you need to overcome the next hurdle. On the flip side, when seeking to
  break a bad habit making the behaviors inconvenient or placing barriers can be
  key to creating space and distance.

  *   _Safeguards:_ Anticipating temptation and creating ‘if-then’ rules can
  protect your most important habits in high-risk situations.

  *   _Loop-hole Spotting:_ Otherwise known as situational excuses, it is best
  to identify and shut down these loop holes to avoid slipping too far away from
  the desired behavior.

  *   _Distraction: “When we distract ourselves, we purposefully redirect our
  thoughts, and by doing so, we change our experience” (184)._

  *   _Rewards vs. Treats:_ While rewards can be dangerous for habit formation,
  treats can be used for every day enhancement, not earned rather enjoyed ‘just
  because’.

  *   _Pairing:_ Combining a less desirable activity with one that you want or
  enjoy can be the trick to reframing the activity and ensuring both get done.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Better than Before_ is an invaluable tool in deepening your understanding of
  the relationship between your natural tendencies and desired habits. Gretchen
  Rubin is thorough in her exploration of habit-forming strategies and has
  conveniently labeled and paired them in a way that makes them highly
  applicable. Where it is dense in content, reprieve can be sought in the
  various case studies and engaging storytelling. Being mindful of the process
  of habit formation can be just what you need to capture success in your next
  set of goals.

> “For good or bad, habits are the invisible architecture of daily life. Research suggests that about 40% of our behavior is repeated almost daily, and mostly in the same context.” _\- Better than Before, page 7_

The art of change is a continual commitment, day after day, to small actions that lead to big developments. When these daily commitments become habits, we free up time, energy and perhaps money as they become entrenched in our everyday. It is making those habits stick by tailoring them to your natural tendencies that is the hot topic of _Better than Before_, by Gretchen Rubin. The inherent challenge Rubin leaves the reader with is simply, to know yourself. The strategies that you will need to apply in times of habit formation will be wholly dependent on your tendency, which you can identify by taking [an online quiz](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3163256/Gretchen-Rubin-s-Quiz-The-Four-Tendencies-Fall2016).
