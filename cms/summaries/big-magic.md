  ### Big Magic


  > "I’m talking about living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity
  than by fear."- Big Magic, page 9


  The key to creative living is opening yourself up to inspiration. Inspiration
  is constantly on the look out for viable options, humans who are ready,
  curious and willing to explore an idea and adopt a new opportunity. This
  adoption is not without fear, but it doesn’t allow for fear to overshadow the
  process. “When people try to kill off their fear,” Gilbert says, “they often
  end up inadvertently murdering their creativity in the process.”


  The _Big Magic_ approach itself could enlist fear in those outside of
  Gilbert’s target audience; the very concept that the creative process requires
  a deep belief in both magic and the magical can be unsettling. Although these
  concepts are often excluded from formal career coaching, with an open mind
  Gilbert’s explanation of our relationship with inspiration can prove to be a
  valuable thought starter:


  “Ideas are a disembodied energetic life-form. They are completely separate
  from us, but capable of interacting with us… Ideas are driven by a single
  impulse, to be made manifest. And the only way an idea can be made manifest in
  our world is through collaboration with a human partner. It is only through a
  human’s efforts than an idea can be escorted out of the ether and into the
  realm of the actual.”


  When an idea has found a suitable human partner, presumably you, it will try
  to wave you down on countless occasions, and if you don’t bite—it will move
  on. The urgency here is to open yourself up to those ideas. Limit your
  distractions, open your mind and prepare yourself for the next big
  inspiration.


  Think you’ve got hold of it? The next step is to persist, create and trust.

  ### Don’t be a Martyr


  > "Interesting outcomes are just awful outcomes with the volume of drama
  turned way down"- Big Magic, page 247


  Creators of all types carry a reputation for martyrdom; the tortured artist,
  the tormented writer, and the perpetually overwhelmed executive. The danger of
  martyrdom is quite simply that it is a dramatic, dark and uninspiring place to
  be in.


  Gilbert introduces an enticing alternative: the Trickster. Tricksters trust
  the universe, they are optimistic, sly, primal, and endlessly shape shifting.
  Embrace the Trickster and you’ll find the burden of success and the ultimate
  need for perfection will fade away, leaving you with the raw inspiration and
  the persistent curiosity to power through to completion. “Fierce trust demands
  that you put forth the work anyhow, because fierce trust knows that the
  outcome does not matter,” Gilbert explains.

  ### Persistent Curiosity


  > "The question is not so much ‘What are you passionate about?’ The question
  is ‘What are you passionate about ENOUGH that you can endure the most
  disagreeable aspects of that work?’"- Big Magic, page 150


  Okay, so inspiration has struck. Now comes the work. Regardless of our level
  of connection with or the strength of our inspiration—there will always be
  challenges and obstacles that make it less desirable as time goes on. Instead
  of resisting or giving up, “a different way is to cooperate fully, humbly, and
  joyfully with inspiration,” Gilbert suggests. Grounding yourself in curiosity
  can be the key to persistence, as “curiosity is what keeps you working
  steadily, while hotter emotions may come and go.”


  As a budding entrepreneur, paperwork and logistics may have you dreading
  kicking off, but stay close to your inspiration and the promise of curiosity
  can allow you to preserve through to fruition. Or, as an ambitious team leader
  looking to shake things up with an innovative project, forecasting the tough
  bits and the end goals can help create a road map that allows for
  sustainability and persistence.


  Sound daunting? Give it a whirl, because “it’s a simple and generous rule of
  life that whatever you practice, you will improve at.”
f_conclusion: >-
  While a fluffy and softer approach to creativity, _Big Magic_ is quite
  frankly, inspiring. As it turns out, taking the rigorous and quantifiable
  nature of goal setting out of the equation leaves room for creative living,
  which can be a very productive place to be. We can all take a page out of
  Gilbert’s expose, trust in the process of inspiration, lighten up our own
  expectations, and loosen our definition of success—because when we do—magical
  things can happen!

> "What do you love doing so much that the words failure and success essentially become irrelevant?" _\- Big Magic, page 259_

Flirting with change brings about feelings of fear and resistance in the best of us, whether you’re an entrepreneur, established in your career or in transition. Change requires action, action requires inspiration and inspiration requires trust. Elizabeth Gilbert in her latest outpouring of creative energy gifted her readers with _Big Magic_, an expose into the world of creative living. This piece has a target audience, those that are creatively bound such as painters, writers, and artists alike; but also speaks to the ambitious, driven and passionate career minded person looking to create change within their career or career path.

As career minded folk, creation could be in the form of a budding business idea, an innovative project, or a career leap. Ultimately Gilbert urges her readers to open themselves up to inspiration, persist through challenges and strive to produce something incredible without the pressure of pending success or the fear of failure.

More reflective than actionable, this piece offers valuable thought starters that could serve as your next biggest catalyst for creation.
