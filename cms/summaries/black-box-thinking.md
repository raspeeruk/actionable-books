  ### Failure is part of learning and growth


  > "At the level of the brain, the individual, the organization and the system,
  failure is a means — sometimes the only means—of learning, progressing, and
  becoming more creative. This is a hallmark of science, where errors point to
  how theories can be reformed; of sports, where practice could be defined as
  the willingness to clock up well-calibrated mistakes; and of aviation where
  every accident is harnessed as a means of driving system safety."- Black Box
  Thinking, page 266


  The difference between people and cultures who learn from their mistakes and
  those who don’t is how they picture their failures. Those with a Fixed Mindset
  believe their primary qualities like intelligence or talent will not change.
  Those with a Growth Mindset believe they can develop their abilities through
  hard work. Mindset predicts how we approach mistakes. Those with a Fixed
  Mindset ignore mistakes because they feel threatened—mistakes are a sign they
  are inferior and always will be, they were born that way. Those with a Growth
  Mindset are interested in their mistakes because they think about errors
  differently. They believe practice drives progress, and failure is an
  inevitable part of learning and an opportunity.


  Cultivating a Growth Mindset ensures we reap the benefits of our mistakes.
  Rather than casting blame and punishing errors, we should openly accept
  mistakes, view them as a challenge and a key to progress.

  ### Blaming increases mistakes and impedes learning and progress


  > "In the worlds of business, politics, aviation, and health care, people
  often make mistakes for subtle, situational reasons. The problem is often not
  a lack of focus, it is a consequence of complexity. Increasing punishment, in
  this context, doesn’t reduce mistakes, it reduces openness. It drives the
  mistakes underground. The more unfair the culture, the greater the punishment
  for honest mistakes and the faster the rush to judgment, the deeper this
  information is buried. This means that lessons are not learned, so the same
  mistakes are made again and again, leading to more punitive punishment, and
  even deeper concealment and back-covering."- Black Box Thinking, page 228


  Power is seductive; it’s tempting to believe we are capable of controlling the
  outcome of every situation to ensure our prosperity and happiness. We also
  like to think others control or should be capable of controlling situational
  issues in their lives. The world is extraordinarily complex, and often errors
  occur because we cannot identify, understand, or control all the elements of a
  situation. Instead of recognizing the complexity and investigating to learn
  more we often simplify the facts. Then we unfairly blame and punish people for
  mistakes. So when someone makes an honest mistake, they panic and bury the
  evidence to avoid retribution. Without the data from the error to learn, it’s
  like practicing golf in the dark—we make the same mistakes, repeatedly.


  Instead of blaming, it’s useful to respect that we all make mistakes and how
  we respond impacts our chances of success in the future. Even though we don’t
  control all the external forces that can sabotage our best-laid plans, instead
  of blaming others for our misfortune, an honest evaluation of the facts can
  guide us to future success. Blaming also closes lines of communication and
  keeps us in the dark. The accused are unlikely to communicate openly and
  disclose information that may be vital to solving problems.


  Albert Einstein said, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately
  curious.” It’s passionate curiosity that allows us to view failure as part of
  learning and growth. When we’re curious, we don’t blame others because that
  would deprive us of learning the facts. Also, in Einstein’s case, his
  curiosity led him to practice and learn from mistakes until he was not only an
  expert but an innovator benefiting the world beyond his field of physics.
  Einstein was arguably unique in many ways but, curiosity isn’t an exceptional
  talent some people are born with, it’s a practice we can all cultivate.
  Curiosity stimulates our desire to deconstruct our mistakes, evaluate and
  learn from the data, and use it to improve our results and create new ideas.

  ### Practice results in expertise when we learn from mistakes


  > "If we wish to improve the judgment of aspiring experts then we shouldn’t
  just focus on conventional issues like motivation and commitment. In many
  cases, the only way to drive improvement is to find a way of ‘turning the
  lights on.’ Without access to the ‘error signal,’ one could spend years in
  training or in a profession without improving at all."- Black Box Thinking,
  page 47


  Practice alone does not improve our performance or result in progress. Syed
  mentions the 10,000-hour rule where 10,000 hours of practice should lead to
  expertise. The problem is it doesn’t unless we couple our practice with
  careful evaluation of errors and calculated improvements. Syed uses golf as an
  example. A golfer gradually improves their game with practice using a process
  of trial and error. If they only practiced in the dark they could practice for
  years, or a lifetime, without improving—they would never know where the ball
  landed. Mistakes precipitate growth only when we see them and use the data to
  enhance performance.


  Fundamental qualities of Growth Mindset are repeatedly practicing with
  awareness, detecting errors, gathering data, and making gradual improvements
  based on experience.

  "This, then, is what we might call ‘black box thinking.’ For organizations
  beyond aviation, it is not about creating a literal black box; rather, it is
  about the willingness and tenacity to investigate the lessons that often exist
  when we fail, but which we rarely exploit. It is about creating systems and
  cultures that enable organizations to learn from errors, rather than being
  threatened by them."

In aviation, the black box records the flight so that in the event of a disaster we can thoroughly examine what went wrong. We then implement changes and take precautionary action against future accidents. In _Black Box Thinking: Why Most People Never Learn From Their Mistakes, But Some Do_, Matthew Syed analyzes the method through which people learn, innovate, and create in business and their personal lives. Across various examples, a familiar pattern emerges that demonstrates that success depends on how we react to failure. Traditionally we punish errors. Punitive actions lead to blaming and covering up valuable information that could be used to learn and generate solutions that would prevent more mistakes. Highly effective organizations, teams, and individuals accept mistakes as normal and as an essential component of growth. As a society to move toward higher performance, we need to redefine our relationship with failure. By redefining failure, we facilitate progress, creativity, and resilience.

To learn from mistakes we need the right kind of system and the right mindset. The system has to track errors and utilize them to spur progress. The cultural or individual mindset must accept mistakes so they are not reframed or suppressed. For this summary, I will focus on the Growth Mindset, which empowers us to reframe mistakes as drivers of improvement and ingenuity instead of flaws to regret.
