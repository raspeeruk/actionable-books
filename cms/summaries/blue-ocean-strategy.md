  ### Create Your Blue Ocean Strategy


  > "Blue oceans, in contrast, are defined by untapped market space, demand
  creation, and the opportunity for highly profitable growth. Although some blue
  oceans are created well beyond existing industry boundaries, most are created
  within red oceans by expanding existing boundaries, as Cirque du Soleil did."-
  Blue Ocean Strategy, page 4


  The blue ocean strategy has been used by companies like Cirque du Soleil to
  completely redefine the industries they entered by turning the conventional
  industry boundaries on its head.


  “Companies need to go beyond competing. To seize new profit and growth
  opportunities, they also need to create blue oceans.”


  There are six fundamental principles to creating a blue ocean strategy, the
  first two of which are explained in the following Insights.

  ### Focus On the Big Picture, Not the Numbers


  > "Here we develop an alternative approach to the existing strategic planning
  process that is based not on preparing a document but on drawing a strategy
  canvas."- Blue Ocean Strategy, page 82


  The second principle in creating a blue ocean strategy is: Focus on the big
  picture, not the numbers. And this is best done using a strategy canvas and
  the 4-Step Visualizing Strategy.


  **The Strategy Canvas:  

  **The strategy canvas is a snapshot that allows you to “clearly see the
  factors that the industry competes on and where the competition currently
  invests.”


  For example, here is Cirque du Soleil’s strategy canvas along with some of its
  competitors.


  ![](/assets/external/65d78bac9c9ad4565a6934a9_cds_strategy_canvas-1.jpeg)


  The horizontal axis captures the factors the industry competes on and invests
  in, while the vertical axis captures the offering level that buyers receive
  across all these key competing factors.


  Based on their strategy canvas, you can see that Cirque du Soleil moved away
  from the conventional circus industry by changing the factors they focused on
  and how much they focused on each factor (i.e. eliminating animal shows,
  adding new factors such as artistic music and dance).


  The most important part of the strategy canvas, however, is the value curve.
  It shows the company’s relative performance across its industry’s factors of
  competition and “a strong value curve has focus, divergence as well as a
  compelling tagline”.


  You can see how Cirque du Soleil’s value curve moved away from the traditional
  and conventional approach of Ringling Bros and Barnum & Bailey. They had a
  clear focus with new factors, and redefined the industry. Based on this, it’s
  not only clear that Cirque du Soleil had a very effective blue ocean strategy,
  but it’s also obvious how important using a strategy canvas is in defining
  Blue Ocean strategies.


  **The 4-Step Visualizing Strategy:  

  **Now that you understand the use of the strategy canvas, you can use it in
  your strategic planning:


  **1\. Visual Awakening2. Visual Exploration3. Visual Strategy Fair4. Visual
  Communication**


  *   Compare your business with your competitors’ by drawing your “as is”
  strategy canvas.


  *   See where your strategy needs to change

  *   Go into the field to explore the six paths to creating blue oceans


  *   Observe the distinctive advantages of alternative products and services


  *   See which factors you should eliminate, create, or change.


  *   Draw your “to be” strategy canvas based on insights from field
  observations.


  *   Get feedback on alternative strategy canvases from customers, competitors’
  customers and noncustomers.


  *   Use feedback to build the best “to be” future strategy


  *   Distribute your before-and-after strategic profiles on one page for easy
  comparison


  *   Support only those projects and operational moves that allow your company
  to close the gaps to actualize the new strategy.

  ### Reconstruct The Market Boundaries


  > "The first principle of blue ocean strategy is to reconstruct market
  boundaries to break from the competition and create blue oceans."- Blue Ocean
  Strategy, page 47


  Based on their research, Kim and Mauborgne found six approaches to
  reconstructing market boundaries which, collectively, are known as the ‘six
  paths framework’. Each ‘path’ challenges “fundamental assumptions underlying
  many company’s strategies”.


  **Blue Ocean Creation**


  **Example**


  **_Key Questions_**


  **Path 1: Look Across Alternative Industries** Often products or services from
  seemingly different industries can be a substitute for what your company
  offers.


  Cinemas and restaurants have few features in common. But despite the
  difference in form or function people go to the restaurant for the same reason
  they go to the movies: to enjoy a night out._What are the alternative
  industries to your industry? Why do customers trade across them?_**Path 2:
  Look Across Strategy Groups Within Industries**Strategic groups are usually
  built on two dimensions: price and performance.Toyota’s Lexus “carved out a
  new blue ocean by offering the quality of the high-end Mercedes, BMW, and
  Jaguar at a price closer to the lower-end Cadillac and Lincoln.” _What are the
  strategic groups in your industry? Why do customers trade up for a higher
  group, and why do they trade down for the lower one?_


  **Path 3: Look Across the Chain of Buyers**There are a chain of buyers who are
  directly or indirectly involved in the buying decision; look across this
  chain.


  Bloomberg shifted focus from IT Managers (which the industry focused on) to
  the actual end users, traders and analysts, when developing their online
  financial systems._What is the chain of buyers in your industry? Which buyer
  group does your industry typically focus on?_


  _If you shifted the buyer group of your industry, how could you unlock new
  value?_


  **Path 4: Look Across Complimentary Product and Service Offerings**Untapped
  value is often hidden in complementary products and services.


  Dyson designs its vacuum cleaners to eliminate the cost and annoyance of
  having to buy and change vacuum cleaner bags._What is the context in which
  your product or service is used? What happens before, during, and after?_


  _Can you identify and eliminate pain points?_


  **Path 5: Look Across Functional or Emotional Appeal to Buyers**Your behaviour
  as a company affects buyers’ expectations in a reinforcing cycle. Over time,
  functionally oriented industries become more functional; emotional industries
  become more emotional. Challenge this notion.


  The Body Shop transformed the emotionally driven cosmetic industry into a
  functional, no-nonsense cosmetics house._Does your industry compete on
  functionality or emotional appeal? If you compete on emotional appeal, what
  elements can you strip out to make it functional?_


  _If you compete on functionality, what elements can be added to make it
  emotional?_


  **Path 6: Look Across Time**All industries are subject to trends that affect
  their businesses over time (i.e. internet, mobile devices)


  Apple recognized the digital music trend with the rise of Napster, Kazaa and
  LimeWire and launched iTunes in response as it adapted to the digital music
  wave._What trends have a high probability of impacting your industry, are
  irreversible, and are evolving in a clear trajectory? How will these trends
  impact your industry?_


  _Given this, how can you open up unprecedented customer utility?_


  As you can see, the key to the six paths framework is asking yourself some
  powerful questions that make you reassess your strategy by looking beyond what
  you may believe are “industry boundaries.” By looking across, as opposed to
  _only within_, industries, strategic groups, buyers, service offerings,
  different types of appeal and time, you get a new perspective on how you can
  not only reconstruct market boundaries, but also drive innovation.
f_conclusion: >-
  These first two principles should give you an idea about the power of not only
  asking specific questions that challenge your industry assumptions, but also
  how using a visual aid like the strategy canvas can significantly enhance your
  strategic planning. _Blue Ocean Strategy_ is one of those books where no
  matter how much you try to summarize, there’s always more you just wish you
  could have included. So just do yourself a favour and read the book.

How are you staying ahead of your competition and providing the most value to your customers?  
What are you doing to not only keep your market share, but also increase it?

If your answer to these questions is grabbing a greater share of existing demand, where you compete with, and benchmark against, competitors based on existing industry factors, you might be stuck in what strategy management experts W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne call a ‘bloody red ocean’.

“In red oceans, industry boundaries are defined and accepted, and the competitive rules of the game are known,” write the authors. “Here, companies try to outperform their rivals to grab a greater share of existing demand. As the market space gets crowded, prospects for profits and growth are reduced. Products become commodities, and cutthroat competition turns the red ocean bloody.”

So how do you get out of this red ocean and swim to fresh waters where you can increase your profits and market share? Well, as you’ll read in _Blue Ocean Strategy_, Kim and Mauborgne suggest your way out is in **_creating a blue ocean_**.

**The Strategy Canvas:  
**The strategy canvas is a snapshot that allows you to “clearly see the factors that the industry competes on and where the competition currently invests.”

For example, here is Cirque du Soleil’s strategy canvas along with some of its competitors.
