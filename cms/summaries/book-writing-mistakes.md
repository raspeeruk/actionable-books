  ### Just do it


  > "The biggest mistake people make when it comes to writing a business book –
  is simply not starting – and then finishing – their book."- Book Writing
  Mistakes, page 2


  Writing a book is the pipe dream of many would-be authors, yet there are many
  pitfalls and obstacles to be overcome, not the least of which is just getting
  down to it and actually writing the book.


  Instead procrastination sets in and we make excuses about not getting down to
  the actual work of writing. Finding a writing “cave” where you can be creative
  can help. You also may have to schedule the time in your calendar otherwise it
  gets all too easy to avoid it.


  Having clarity on what you want to write about, why you want to write it and
  who is your target audience, can make the writing flow more easily. Writing
  daily – even if it is not on your book – is a good practice to adopt.


  Lowering your expectations helps too. Be prepared to fail and fail fast he
  says. If you think you are writing a bestseller and that’s all you want, you
  may be seriously disappointed. In a world where we want everything to be
  perfect, you could find that this drive for perfection will stifle any
  creativity and the book will never see the light of day.


  I believe it all boils down to why you want to write the book in the first
  place. If you have a passion for the topic, are driven to see your words in
  print and want use your book as platform within your business, you are more
  likely to get past the biggest mistake of never actually writing it at all.

  ### Understand your who, why and what


  > "If you try to sell to everyone, you won’t sell to anyone. You’ve got to
  have a specific target audience."- Book Writing Mistakes, page 23


  Before you even start writing your book, you need to be clear on who you are
  writing it for, what their issues are and how your book can help. Too many
  people, he’s observed, rush into writing their book without doing the
  research, and this “ego-driven” approach to book-writing is doomed to fail.


  Instead, Edwards encourages writers to really get under the skin of their
  audience, to understand their challenges, what holds them back and how best to
  provide tools to move them forward.


  But even that is not enough. “In many cases the author mistakenly thinks they
  are giving ‘how to’ information when they’re actually giving ‘what to’
  information” which leaves the reader confused and frustrated.


  As he points out, people don’t have time to think in today’s world. You need
  to “spell it out for them in easy-to-understand terms so they just get the
  point without any extra thought. Also, you need to put it front and centre,
  and make every point obvious and useful for them without thinking.”


  This means you have to be a teacher, and not everyone can do that, he
  observes. It also reinforces the need to know your audience, their skill level
  and ability to follow instructions. Sometimes simple is the best.


  Another trap that authors can fall into is the need to make the book as
  comprehensive as possible. This is understandable, but as Edwards points out,
  from the readers’ perspective that may make the book an overwhelming read.
  Better, he says, to cover the material briefly in 100 pages, than risk it
  never being finished in a 300 page epic size book.

  ### Words matter


  > "Your book’s table of contents is one of the main things people look at
  before buying, along with the title, back cover copy and the ‘About the Author
  page.’"- Book Writing Mistakes, page 46


  So much is involved in selling a book – the cover, the title and as I learned
  through _Book Writing Mistakes_, the chapter titles, too. As the saying goes,
  a book is judged by its cover and getting one professionally designed does not
  have to be the big budget item we would suppose, but can make the difference
  between making the sale or not.


  Edwards busts the myth about short, pithy titles and his explanation makes
  sense when you think about searching for a relevant non-fiction book on the
  Internet. You need key words that will bring your book to your potential
  readers’ attention. If you just have three or four words, your chances are
  much slimmer. He also recommends having a word to describe your target
  audience in the title – in my case, for example – it would be women. All told,
  he suggests that your title have seventeen words, a far cry from the short
  titles we’ve seen on book shelves.


  But it was his advice around chapter titles that really caught my attention,
  as he says authors have “never really given the titles of their chapters much
  thought. In fact, chapter titles for them are often an ‘after thought’ at the
  end of the process.” And yet when you think about it, as we flick through a
  book to see what it is about, it is the titles that give us a clue as to
  whether the book appeals to us and whether we buy it or not.


  “Boring chapter titles mean people won’t buy your book,” he advises. You want
  to create curiosity with your chapter titles to entice the person to believe
  your book will be an interesting read.


  He also encourages the author to forgo the need to sound professional, which
  he equates to boring. And like the title, forget short, three word chapter
  titles. Instead come up with longer ones that give the reader further reason
  to buy. Have some real fun with quirky chapter titles.

  And that is exactly what Edwards has done in this book. At first I was
  skeptical of the depth of information the book would provide, but there’s a
  lot of meat on the bones and he covers information that the would-be writer
  may not have considered when first embarking on a book project.

True confessions. I have to admit my choice of _Book Writing Mistakes: How to Avoid the Top 12 Mistakes New Business Book Authors Make_ by Jim Edwards was somewhat self-serving. You see I am in the midst of writing a new book, not my first, but any tips and advice are always welcome.

Also on its arrival, I was thrilled to see it was a small book and therefore a quick read at 104 pages, and my aging eyes appreciated the large font. All of which made this an easy book to read and to fit into my busy schedule.

Jim Edwards has been self-publishing books for the past twenty years and has been successful at it, with over 100,000 books sold during that period. So clearly he knows what works and what doesn’t. In fact he admits that he’s made many of the mistakes mentioned in the book, but learned his lesson and moved on.

He also speaks to a book being a worthwhile platform for growing other aspects of your business, as it creates a sales funnel and can potentially lead to new clients, new business and a whole new persona for you as the author.

His closing advice is to always have an outline before you start writing. This makes sense, because if you are not clear on your key messages, you could end up all over the map, or worst still, writing nothing of relevance.
