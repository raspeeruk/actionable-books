  ### Joy Money Flow


  > "To find the work you were meant to do, you need to find the right
  combination of joy, money and flow."- Born for This, page 32


  Guillebeau’s solution for career success is the Joy Money Flow model, which is
  a three-part template for figuring out what you want to do.


  *   **Joy** – What makes us happy?

  *   **Money** – Will someone pay us to do it?

  *   **Flow** – Do we lose track of time while doing something we love?


  According to the author, we don’t have to choose between our love of work and
  making a living. We can have both. In addition, our values change throughout
  our lives. We may begin our career focused on finding happiness and flow, but
  gradually transition to jobs providing more financial security as we get older
  and have increasing financial obligations.


  So, where does one start? He suggests making a list of all the possibilities
  you can think of (including your current and past roles). Eliminate any ideas
  that don’t have the opportunity to produce any income, followed by those where
  your skillset is not unique. What’s left is a great starting point to begin
  building your dream career.


  The author also makes a valid point that “our careers are rarely as ordered or
  intentional as we tend to assume.” Industries can change, our interests and
  priorities can shift and personal growth can stagnate. Hence, the importance
  of developing more than one income stream and pursuing self-employment.

  ### What’s your Plan B?


  > "Learn to evaluate risks, make better choices, and create a series of backup
  plans that will allow you to take the right kinds of chances."- Born for This,
  page 57


  Since life doesn’t always work out as planned, we need to have something to
  fall back on. The author lists several risk-mitigating strategies to enhance
  the possibilities of career success.


  The first step is to list all the possible things that can go wrong with a
  particular opportunity. Being fully aware what the risks are going in can
  enhance your confidence. Or it might make you realize that the risks aren’t
  worth it.


  Having more than one source of income and keeping your expenses lower than
  your earnings can “allow you to take on more risks in the search for your
  lottery-winning career.” Guillebeau considers these as career insurance and
  they can provide peace of mind when things don’t go as planned.


  Also, in today’s inter-connected world, relationships are an important asset.
  He strongly encourages us to consider ways to be helpful and friendly to
  colleagues and friends. This shouldn’t be difficult with all the social media
  tools available today. Staying connected to your network pays dividends in the
  long-term.


  Lastly, sharpening your soft skills can be one of the best investments you can
  make in yourself, in addition to boosting your transferable abilities. These
  competencies can be used in any career and increase your value. The four
  skillsets that Guillebeau considers valuable are writing, negotiation,
  conflict management, and follow-up.

  ### Self-employment is the new pension


  > "Sometimes the job you want doesn’t exist-and usually when that happens it’s
  because you don’t actually want a job, you want full control of your income
  and career. Many people who work for themselves believe this is actually the
  safest and most secure career path."- Born for This, page 175


  Most entrepreneurs don’t start out wanting to build their own empire. The
  drive for independence usually stems from dissatisfaction with the status quo
  or having an itch be in control of their destiny. Don’t worry though, you
  don’t have to quit your job to become an entrepreneur full-time. Guillebeau
  suggests starting a side hustle, which he defines as “a means of earning money
  apart from your job.”


  Side hustles are ideal for discovering your passions, with the added benefit
  of bringing in some income. It’s a great way to test the business idea before
  fully committing. He also suggests starting the business with a low level of
  investment, to minimize the financial risks. The key to happiness in your new
  venture is to merge what you enjoy doing with what people are willing to pay.


  So what kind of side hustle can you start? The focus should be on providing
  solutions, whether by selling something, providing a consulting service (such
  as a how-to guide) or just joining the sharing economy as a provider.
  Countless people have started driving their cars part-time for Uber or rented
  out the extra room in their house with Airbnb to supplement their income.

  Chris Guillebeau’s _Born for This_ encourages personal responsibility for our
  own careers and is a valuable take charge manual for finding what you were
  born to do. So figure out what makes you happy and create a side hustle. What
  were you born to do?

  "There’s more than one possible path to career success, but you want to find
  the best one-the thing you were born to do. You want to win the career lottery
  and discover a job or vocation that doesn’t feel like work. Achieving this
  goal will require changes in mindset, strategy and action."

Chris Guillebeau, the best-selling author of _The $100 Start-up_ and _The Happiness of Pursuit_, knows a thing or two about finding your ideal career.
