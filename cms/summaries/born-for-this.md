  ### Joy, Money, Flow


  > ""Maybe it’s not that complicated: for the most part, we all want to find a
  career that meets the same few specific needs.""- Born for This, page 31


  At the very basic level, Guillebeau explains that a perfect career for anyone
  is centered on three basic principles: Joy, Money and Flow.


  **Joy** is something is something that you like to do. It makes you happy to
  do it, and work is enjoyable.


  **Money** is what supports you to pay the bills and provide for your family,
  enabling you to live comfortably.


  **Flow** is what you’re good at. It’s when you lose track of time because you
  are so engrossed in your work and it feels easy. It is your unique skills.


  Managing all three of these is the key to success, or as the author calls your
  “career lottery”, which is not a matter of luck, but is more about trial and
  error. He reminds us throughout the book to constantly evaluate your work
  life.


  To determine your career focus—whether that is a job or self-employment—use
  these principles as a guide. First, identify what is important to you within
  the context of Joy, Money and Flow. List them and then start eliminating,
  beginning with things that don’t give you joy—there is no point in pursuing a
  job that brings no joy. Next eliminate ideas that don’t have a potential to
  create income, and finally eliminate ideas that you not particularly good at,
  where your skills aren’t unique. The trick is to create harmony within this
  framework.


  If your current situation is unbalanced, don’t despair, you can take steps to
  realign the balance. For instance, you could find the time to pursue joy
  outside of work, making it a daily habit. If financially stressed, concentrate
  on getting out of debt as quickly as possible and if you don’t know your flow,
  ask your friends for guidance in identifying things that come easily to you.


  The ideal relationship between these variables isn’t the same for everyone and
  isn’t consistent across your lifespan as your priorities change. Asking
  pertinent questions can help identify where your values lie, such as:


  *   Work is very important to me (Joy).

  *   I want to know I do my work well (Flow).

  *   I’m in a difficult financial situation or need to save a substantial
  amount of money (Money).


  Of equal importance is not only what your job is, but also the working
  conditions, such as flexibility of schedule, reporting and accountability,
  social environment, sense of contribution, security, collaboration, etc. It’s
  important to find the working conditions that suit your personal preferences,
  which are not the same for everybody.


  Guillebeau is the author of [_The $100
  Startup_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-100-startup/),
  so it’s no surprise that a large proportion of the book is devoted to risk
  assessment, developing side hustle businesses, risk, and workshifting (having
  multiple jobs). Actionable insights include:


  *   Look at how you can achieve Joy-Money-Flow by reassessing your talents,
  network and assets.

  *   Try a new venture to generate income, and experiment constantly.

  *   Believe in yourself. Look at your options from a new viewpoint.

  *   Don’t be afraid to quit.

  ### Question your future


  > "Much interview advice is basic and boring, but there's something that all
  career experts agree on: it's important to come prepared with some questions
  of your own."- Born for This, page 216


  You have landed an interview for the perfect job, but how do you ensure that
  the balance is correct and you won’t be disappointed? The questions Guillebeau
  suggests are designed to not only determine if the job is a right fit, it also
  indicates a genuine interest in the job and demonstrates a desire for autonomy
  and independence.


  Questions can include:


  *   What’s the greatest problem you team is currently experiencing?

  *   What’s the most valuable contribution I could bring to this role?

  *   Can you describe a general day in the life of this role? How would the
  successful person divide his time or organize his time or responsibilities to
  do it well?

  *   How will performance be measured?

  *   If I wanted to work on additional areas of responsibility outside the
  official role, how would you feel about that?


  As an employer for the last 20 years, I find that interested employees
  sometimes forget to ask questions in interviews. Keep these and others in your
  memory bank, and you will be more successful in your next interview.

  ### Breaking out of prison


  > "Breaking out of prison – whether a real one or one surrounded by cubicle
  walls – will force you to think differently and use a varied set of tools."-
  Born for This, page 77


  Guillebeau devotes a chapter to successfully escaping from a job that is a
  poor fit. Rather than making a big mistake and jumping ship too early, he
  suggests turning your attention to developing skills that will allow you to
  leave.


  Firstly, write down an inventory of your current skills, then do the opposite
  and identify skills you need to improve or upgrade. The skills that are
  particularly important are what Guillebeau refers to as soft skills and can be
  self-taught in many instances, such as:


  *   Improving your writing skills, learning to be persuasive, interesting,
  confident, and learning ways to get people on your side.

  *   Learning to negotiate, looking for solutions where both sides win.

  *   Improving your follow up and follow through procedures, giving yourself
  deadlines and sticking to them.

  *   Improving your technological skills, which will give you a clear advantage
  in this digital world.


  As an annual exercise designed to reassess your current reality, make the
  following commitments to yourself: on a self-chosen date make the decision to
  break out of prison and do something different unless staying is the best way
  forward. If your job is making you miserable or does not have a good
  Joy-Money-Flow balance, then takes steps to make a break.


  Embracing failure and quitting a job that’s not a good fit allows us to
  reframe everything. This is Guillebeau’s mantra and within the book he cites
  several examples of people hitting the career lottery after quitting.

_Born for This_ addresses the old age problem of finding your perfect career and the work that you were “born to do”. Many of us struggle to find rewarding jobs or careers that make us happy, and a large percentage of people remain in unrewarding jobs because they don’t feel they have any alternatives. Chris Guillebeau enters a complicated arena and simplifies the solutions to finding meaningful work with a wry sense of humour, whilst also promoting and encouraging implementation of change against long term dogma. He gives us a road map to find our dream job, as well as the inspiration to allow us to live with more purpose and meaning, as well as being paid handsomely to do what you love.
