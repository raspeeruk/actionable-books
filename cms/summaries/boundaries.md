  ### Build Boundaries


  > "...boundaries are a way to describe our spheres of responsibility: what we
  are and are not responsible for. While we shouldn’t take on the responsibility
  of others’ feelings, attitudes, and behaviors, we do have certain
  responsibilities to each other."- Boundaries, page 57


  Boundaries are often helpful solutions to solve a problem. Do you have a
  colleague who always calls for a last minute favor? A relative who guilts you
  into agreeing to a family party you would rather eat cough drops than attend?
  A friend you can never tell no, regardless of your availability?


  Clearly communicated, and enforced, boundaries can help in each of these
  situations. Boundaries help communicate who is responsible for what including
  feelings, attitudes, and behaviors. Boundaries are not absolute, just as a
  fence has a gate to allow a flow of things to enter and exit the boundary. It
  is important to note when setting boundaries that you are setting boundaries
  for yourself. You cannot set boundaries for another person. A boundary is a
  decision that you make beforehand of what you will or will not do.


  A boundary could be as simple as the word no, letting that colleague know that
  you will not be available to help last minute so they will need to find
  someone else. Another boundary could be that nothing interrupts family dinner
  time or that you will leave the office every night by 5.

  ### Give Yourself a Time


  > "Work will grow to fill the time you have set aside for it. If a meeting
  does not have an agenda with time limits, discussion could be endless. Allot
  time for certain things, and then keep your limits."- Boundaries, page 200


  Things usually take longer than we anticipate. Furthermore, when no timeframe
  is provided delay is inevitable. This is why “clean out the garage” will sit
  for months on a to-do list with little hope of completion. The nebulous
  someday schedule has no end in sight.


  Setting time boundaries is not intended to turn you into a clock watcher.
  Instead, a boundary with your work is intended to provide focus. If you know
  you have 30 minutes for a meeting and everyone else knows that you will
  physically get up and leave when that time is up, people are more likely to
  stay on task. Cloud believes that setting boundaries and sticking to them,
  with your work, will result in working smarter.

  ### School Your Feelings


  > "If you are angry... it is your responsibility to do something about it."-
  Boundaries, page 152


  Cloud explains that feelings act as a warning system indicating that you need
  to take action. First, you need to accept that you are responsible for your
  feelings. If you believe that your anger is another’s problem you will wait
  some time before they notice; if they do, and once they do, they are unlikely
  to do much to solve the problem. This kind of boundary is empowering because
  if you are in charge of your feelings then you can do something about them—you
  are not held hostage by the whims of another. If you don’t like your feelings,
  since you are responsible for them, you can do something about it. You have
  the opportunity to change.


  Second, if you want others to know your feelings, you need to tell them. While
  this sounds obvious, think about the number of times you have thought someone
  knew what you were feeling from the look on your face and then become upset
  when they somehow got a different message. Boundaries have to be communicated
  to be of any real value. You don’t exist in a vacuum and boundaries are only
  useful as they relate to others. It is important to remember: boundaries you
  set for yourself will impact those around you.
f_conclusion: >-
  I’ve learned that setting boundaries relies heavily on communicating. When
  trying to be more open about my thoughts or feelings I felt like I was over
  communicating with others. However, I learned that it was exactly what was
  needed to help others understand. When I am frustrated it is much more
  efficient to explain “I am frustrated because…” instead of waiting for someone
  to divine “Hey Jake, you are frustrated. Let me guess why.” Writing this
  sounds obvious, but it is amazing how many times such an obvious answer went
  unused.

> "Boundaries are anything that helps to differentiate you from someone else, or shows where you begin and end." _\- Boundaries, page 33_

If you own a parcel of land you know precisely where that property begins and ends. Equipped with that information you know what you are responsible for and act accordingly. Just as important, the person who owns the property on the other side of that line is also aware of their responsibilities. This common understanding provides the basis for good neighbors.

However, in our relationships and interactions with others we often lack such signposts and clearly delineated indications of who is responsible for what. Have you ever been invited out to dinner by a friend and then when the check arrives there is that awkward moment of who is responsible for the check? Also, who’s paying may change what you choose to order. If you’re paying you might order the steak and a drink, if your friend is paying maybe you’ll go with the pasta and water. This is a trivial experience of how uncomfortable a lack of boundaries can be, but unfortunately most situations involving boundaries are much tenser. Henry Cloud, author of _Boundaries_, believes that “Any confusion of responsibility and ownership in our lives is a problem of boundaries.” He believes that through setting “mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual boundaries” we can alleviate the angst that often accompanies relationships and expectations.

I found that setting boundaries can also be uncomfortable; telling that friend no is more difficult than saying yes and grumbling about the results. However, once in place, the boundaries help to make clear expectations and the next time I have to say no the result is less awkward silence and more understanding and more importantly, a much healthier friendship.
