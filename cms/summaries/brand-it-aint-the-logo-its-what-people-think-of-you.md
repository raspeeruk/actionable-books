  ### Limited Brain Space


  > "...while always, always keeping in mind the number one rule of Branding: be
  consistent."- Brand, page 48


  Here’s a fundamental problem for most marketers and business leaders: We’re
  surrounded by our brand every day. We see the logo, brand colors and taglines
  every day, several hours a day. We are informed as to the “big picture” of how
  all the pieces fit together, and the messages we’re trying to share with the
  outside world. The outside world, by comparison, gets our message in pieces
  scattered throughout their day, and interspersed with a million other messages
  from a million other companies and brands. What’s the problem here?


  **The problem is that it’s easy for us to get tired/bored/sick of our branding
  long before our target customers are even aware of it.**


  It doesn’t matter what you think of your logo, colors, messaging, etc. It
  matters what the customer thinks. It matters that we “stay the course” long
  enough to sink into the conscious and subconscious brains of our clients. It
  matters that we repeat ourselves over, and over, and over again in a
  consistent fashion. This isn’t sexy. It isn’t splashy, and it’s not as
  exciting as doing something new. But it works.

  ### Give them Clarity


  > "Give the proper tools to a group of people who like to make a difference,
  and they will."- Brand, page 131


  To hammer this point about consistency home, let’s talk about brand advocates
  in general, and social media, specifically. Now, more than ever, people are
  aligning themselves with brands that share their values; values like
  _quality_, _safety_, _philanthropy_, _innovation_, _family_, _etc._ People are
  proud of the brands they buy from and want to share the message. What message
  are you giving them to share? Have you made it easy for people to talk about
  you? Have you made it easy for a number of different people to share a
  consistent message? Have the discipline to stick to a single message and then
  provide sound bites, links, contests, stories and examples that reinforce the
  point. Make it easy for people to promote you in a unified way. Waves crashing
  into one another may make a short term splash, but tidal waves build by water
  moving consistently in the same direction over long distances. Commit to the
  power of a tidal wave.

  ### "Fresh", not "New"


  > "These creatives may or may not realize that coming up with something fresh
  is actually a lot harder than dreaming up something new."- Brand, page 55


  As Matthews points out in the book, the advertising and marketing worlds are
  particularly fond of award shows; of patting each other on the back and
  glamorizing innovative advertising campaigns. There’s an expectation and
  desire in advertising to “make your mark” by creating something new and
  noteworthy, both for public acclaim and as a resume builder. The challenge, as
  we discussed in the The Big Idea, is that **New** destroys traction and brand
  recognition. New confuses the audience, splintering the coherent understanding
  of what the brand’s about. In a world saturated with marketing messages,
  confusion or fuzziness as to what a brand stands for can mean capitulation or
  even death. Be fresh, by all means – l look for new ways to express the same
  values and/or iconic imagery (Energizer Bunny, anyone?) – but don’t go “new
  for new’s sake”. It’s not about you. It’s about the audience and their
  understanding of what you stand for.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Brand: It Ain’t the Logo_ is an excellent reminder that marketing isn’t about
  your latest ad, but instead is your customers (ideally) deep rooted
  understanding of what your company stands for. Certainly if you work in
  marketing, but **particularly** if you own the company or work on the senior
  leadership team, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy and commit to the
  short read. You’ll be glad you did.

  "Yet it's very scary, because adopting a single position means forgoing all
  others. So most Brands water down their point of difference in an effort to
  avoid alienating anyone. The result, instead, is a Brand that doesn't deeply
  resonate with anyone."

> "Yet it's very scary, because adopting a single position means forgoing all others. So most Brands water down their point of difference in an effort to avoid alienating anyone. The result, instead, is a Brand that doesn't deeply resonate with anyone." _\- Brand, page 35_

I’m paraphrasing Seth Godin in saying that, “to target everyone is to target no one.” Such is one of the core messages from Ted Matthews simple yet poignant book _Brand: It Ain’t the Logo (It’s What People Think of You)._ A _Globe and Mail_ bestseller, _Brand_ is a practical guide to branding and marketing in the 21st century.

Perhaps what I enjoyed most about this book is the parallel Matthews draws between **brand** and **culture**. Matthews believes (as I do) that in today’s world – where the average consumer is savvy, active and hyper-connected – your brand is the culmination of customer experience. Every interaction, therefore, will impact your brand – either to the positive or the negative. As the average consumer gets bombarded by more and more messages in a given day, that window in which to make an impression (hopefully positive!) grows smaller and smaller. We need to be clear, we need to stand for something and, most importantly, we need to be **consistent.**
