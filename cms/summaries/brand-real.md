  ### Making It Stick


  > "How well a brand is retrieved from memory is a critically important factor
  when you play the memory game. We forget about a lot of brands we encounter,
  but that doesn’t mean they don’t get stored in memory. It just means they
  aren’t top of mind. An effective brand is easy for us to store in memory and
  hard to forget."- Brand Real, page 30


  Why do certain brands remain in the forefront of our minds, while other recede
  and are quickly forgotten? If you’re running a book store, how will you ensure
  that a potential consumer who wants a copy of _The Hunger Games_ goes to you
  rather than order it online from Amazon? The answer is simple, if not easy…
  create a brand that won’t be forgotten!


  Our brain can’t possibility remember all of the data it’s exposed to on a
  daily basis. When we fail to connect it with something concrete, it’s easily
  forgotten into the abyss of our minds. So at the outset, Vincent requests that
  you consider the following questions:


  *   _“What is it about my brand that will allow me past the brain filter?_

  *   _What can I do to ensure my brand sticks in a consumer’s long-term
  memory?_

  *   _How do I encourage a consumer’s brain to recall my brand at relevant
  moments in time?”_


  The two following Insights will help you answer those questions and create a
  brand that will be remembered.

  ### Stack Your Brand


  > "When I ask them to clarify the type of brand they want to be, I’m not
  asking them to limit their options. I’m asking them to tell me which type of
  brand will give them the most competitive advantage."- Brand Real, page 45


  Whether they know it or not, consumers unconsciously categorize brands as
  **cultures**, **destinations**, **products**, **services**, and
  **ingredients**.


  **Cultures** are brands that thrive because of their people. Culture brands
  are strongly associated with values, values of the employees, customers,
  partners, communities, and investors.


  **Destinations** are brands offering a place for the consumer to go, and often
  provide an experience.


  **Products** are physical, tangible items.


  **Services** are more difficult to conceptualize. “We can’t really see or
  touch a service brand,” writes Vincent. “A service isn’t a concrete thing;
  it’s a means to an end. A service brand relieves us of the burden of labor,
  often by having other people do it for us” (page 41).


  **Ingredients** are often the most difficult of brands to understand. Vincent
  describes ingredients as “something that a host brand includes to make itself
  more valuable. When the ingredient brand is very powerful, it can claim a
  significant share of the premium a consumer might be willing to pay” (page
  42). For example, the Tazo tea that is used to make my Passion Tea Lemonade
  (my favourite!) at Starbucks.


  Knowing the type of brand you want to be is critical in making your brand
  stick in the consciousness of your consumers. Laurence Vincent writers that
  when he asks which category a client’s brand fits into, “\[t\]hey argue that
  it’s not practical to think of a brand in one narrow dimension. They’re
  surprised when I agree with them” (page 45). Rather he’s trying to maximize
  the category that will offer the biggest competitive advantage. That doesn’t
  mean that your brand has to be pigeonholed into only one of these categories;
  indeed, it can belong to all of them. Starbucks, for example, is a brand that
  could fit into all five categories. But during the planning stages, the
  executives decided that above all Starbucks would be a destination, and used
  that conclusion to make “decisions that might not have made if they had wanted
  Starbucks to be known first and foremost as an ingredient” (i.e. opening
  thousands of Starbucks around the globe). But maximizing your competitive
  advantage means that your brand has the potential to stick and be remembered
  by your customers.

  ### Make It Concrete


  > "Concrete ideas are specific. They connect to concepts we already know and
  understand. They are tangible, not abstract."- Brand Real, page 30


  To ensure that your brand is not forgotten, associate it with a concrete idea.


  Vincent writes about working with a company who described their brand as being
  “all about _wonder_.” What? That’s so vague! Would you purchase a product that
  promised wonder? Laurence Vincent wouldn’t, and neither would I. It doesn’t
  tell us anything about the brand, and leads to even more confusion.


  Many believe that associating a brand with a concrete idea is restrictive.
  This isn’t true. Vincent offers Nike and Amazon as examples. Nike was
  originally all about shoes. But now they sell bags, workout wear, gear for
  skateboarding and snowboarding, and even women’s bras. But people still
  associate them with shoes, and chances are that’s the first thing you thought
  of when I mentioned the Nike brand. The same is true of Amazon. Originally
  they presented themselves to the world as an online book retailer, but since
  then have grown to include the following categories: movies, music and games;
  electronics and computers; home, garden and tools; grocery, health and beauty;
  toys, kids and baby; clothing, shoes and jewelry; sports and outdoors;
  automotive and industrial—and that’s just the beginning! Each category then
  expands further to reveal sub-categories.


  So, don’t be afraid to allow your brand to latch onto something concrete and
  expand from there. You’re not limiting yourself; rather you’re giving your
  brand the potential to expand by allowing it to be identified with something
  tangible in your consumer’s minds.

  With his first book, _Legendary Brands_, and now with _Brand Real_, Laurence
  Vincent has established himself as the go-to guy on the topic of effective
  branding. For anyone looking to brand or re-brand their company, Laurence
  Vincent’s _Brand Real_ is the book for you. This is _the_ branding bible.

We all have our favourite brands, whether it’s Sony BRAVIA flat screen TVs, Louis Vuitton hand bags, or Lexus vehicles. Even people are brands (think Walt Disney, Oprah Winfrey, or Martha Stewart, just to name a few). The term ‘brand’ is one that everyone knows—or at least think they know.

But brands are more than merely a slick logo, a new name, or a sexy advertising campaign. It’s what’s under the flash and all that marketing that truly counts. If you don’t deliver on your promise of what your brand offers, it means nothing, and you’ll find yourself without a customer base. It’s as simple as that, says author Laurence Vincent in his new book, _Brand Real_. Vincent has worked with Coca-Cola, MasterCard, Microsoft, the NFL, Sony Playstation, The Four Seasons, and many more, and currently heads The Brand Studio at United Talent Agency.

After many years of coming to the aid of globally recognized brands, this time he’s here to help _you_!
