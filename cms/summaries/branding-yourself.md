  ### Everyone can benefit from self-promotion


  > "...but if you want to make a name for yourself, establish a good
  reputation, finally get that corner office, or even own your own successful
  business, you need to promote yourself."- Branding Yourself, page 6


  Regardless of who you are, or what you do, social media can be invaluable in
  helping you reach the next level. From Facebook and Twitter, to personal blogs
  and LinkedIn, there are multiple platforms available to help you tell your
  story, and manage your personal brand.


  With so much competition out there, it is imperative to create a personal
  brand that will help you stand out from everyone else. Although it may sound
  difficult, creating a personal brand is really all about creating the type of
  emotional response you want people to have when they hear your name, meet you
  in person, or see your profile online.


  We all have a unique story, and even though we may be uncomfortable with the
  idea of self-promotion, it is important to realize that **self-promotion is
  really just another way of telling our story to the world**, and keeping our
  contacts updated on what is going on in our lives.

  ### Let your personality shine through


  > "Social media has blurred the line between our personal and professional
  lives anyway, so there’s nothing wrong with letting some of your ‘public
  personal’ life bleed over into your professional life."- Branding Yourself,
  page 60


  Much like walking a tight rope, **finding the right blend of personal and
  professional in your brand requires a fine balance**. Though sharing a bit of
  your personal life may not help in building credibility from a professional
  standpoint, it is through the sharing of some of this personal information
  that people come to know, and also trust you. This trust is what will motivate
  individuals to want to become involved in what you are doing.


  The fine balance comes from making sure that if you are writing or sharing
  information on a blog or account that is used strictly for professional
  branding that you don’t become too personal or too controversial. Potential
  employers or business contacts may be turned off by such content, and this can
  have a negative impact on your professional reputation.


  A good rule of thumb to keep in mind when using social media to work on your
  branding campaign is that if you would be embarrassed for your boss, a
  potential employer, or any other business contact to hear you say it, then
  don’t post it. **You need to own your brand, and everything associated with
  it.**

  ### Weaving a fine tapestry


  > "Don’t use only one tool - If you are building a workbench, do you use only
  a hammer? No. It takes a mitre saw, a tape measure, and a drill. The same
  concept applies to launch your campaign. Don’t use only Twitter or only
  Facebook to build your personal brand."- Branding Yourself, page 230


  With so many different social media platforms available, it may seem difficult
  to limit yourself to only one or two tools. The beauty of using social media
  to create your personal brand is that the more tools you implement, the
  stronger your personal brand becomes.


  Much like weaving a tapestry that becomes more interesting and complex
  depending on the amount of colours and textures of fabric used, **your
  personal brand becomes more enticing when you are using the different forms of
  social media in harmony to tell a cohesive story about who you are.**


  From a blog where you can tell longer stories, to Twitter where you are
  constantly updating the world and sharing content that will bring value to
  other people’s lives, it is imperative that you are consistent in the brand
  that you are creating. This means that launching a personal branding campaign
  is not something to be entered into lightly, but rather something that is
  intentional and well thought out. No major brand ever started advertising
  without first having a solid plan, and you neither should you!
