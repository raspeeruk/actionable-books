  ### Knowledge is Power


  > "This now-legendary Axe campaign \[…\] is a fascinating example of just how
  deeply companies and marketers probe the depths of our inner psyches – our
  hopes, dreams, and daydreams."- Brandwashed, page 93


  Most of us are aware of those Axe commercials – an awkward teenage boy uses
  Axe and suddenly becomes an irresistible target for a hoard of scantily clad
  women. It’s a heterosexual male’s fantasy come to life. Literally.


  To pull off this advertising campaign, Unilever conducted an extensive online
  survey of 12,000 boys and men, aged 15 to 50, from around the world. They
  asked deeply personal questions about self-confidence, rejection,
  relationships, and sex. Then, they followed 100 participants of the
  aforementioned demographic and recorded their activities and behaviour while
  they were out at the bar. This data was analyzed and segmented into
  psychological profiles, which were used to determine a target audience and a
  corresponding marketing strategy. Is it any wonder that the campaign was such
  a huge success? To the tune of $71M in 2006 and a whopping $186M in 2007, in
  fact.


  The more companies know about you, the better they can sell you. That’s why
  they spend so much time, money, and effort to conduct such elaborate consumer
  research and glean valuable knowledge. With this information, they’re able to
  sell to you without you realizing that you’ve been sold. That’s pretty
  powerful… and scary!

  ### With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility


  > "Studies have shown that when tweens ask for a pair of Hollister jeans or
  the latest hot Wii game for Christmas, they’re asking for more than the
  latest, hippest product; what they’re really asking for is a dose of
  self-esteem."- Brandwashed, page 133


  Persuasive advertising can have far-reaching and long-lasting effects. They
  can be tremendous for the profiting companies or detrimental for adversely
  affected individuals. These days, children are socialized to believe that
  their peers will like them as long as they wear the latest fashion trends and
  own the newest gadgets. Their self-worth is measured by the brands they are
  associated with.


  So what about the children/tweens/teens who can’t afford to have the trendiest
  stuff? At best, they nag their parents until they give in and buy it for them.
  At worst, they become bullied and ostracized, which can lead to low
  self-esteem, depression, or self-harm. There is a startling and increasing
  trend of teenage suicide due to peer pressure and bullying, so this isn’t
  unfounded; this is the frightening reality.


  As marketers, we need to look beyond the dollar signs. We need to take
  responsibility over the reach and effect of our actions. It took a global
  financial crisis and subsequent recession to tighten controls and develop
  protective legislation for the financial industry. I wonder if and when
  something similar will happen to the advertising industry, and I hate to think
  of what will trigger it.

  ### Caveat Emptor (Let the Buyer Beware)


  > "Our brains are prone to forming mental shortcuts \[…\] known as somatic
  markers, that link cues from our physical world to specific emotional states
  \[…\] Shrewd companies are able to actually plant these somatic markers in our
  minds by creating associations between some positive emotion and their
  product."- Brandwashed, page 199


  Take Lindstrom’s example of the “goji berry” – a magical fruit purported to
  have any number of health-boosting and healing qualities. Magic is certainly
  expensive – a 32oz. bottle of its juice retails anywhere from $30 to $50 at
  American health food and organic stores. Yet there is no concrete scientific
  research to prove that goji berries live up to their hype, and no such health
  claims have been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration.


  This is where we, as consumers, can turn the tide. We have power too, in the
  form of free-flowing information. We currently live in the ultimate
  information age. There’s no such thing as an unanswered question thanks to
  Google and Wikipedia. We can probe, question, detect, reveal, and investigate
  to our heart’s content.


  Unbiased, democratic information is the best shield against manipulative
  marketing. And although not every source is created equally (in terms of
  legitimacy), the fact that we can access information created and disseminated
  by parties other than the one selling us, makes a huge difference. This makes
  it much more difficult to advertisers to hide the ugly truth. After all, it’s
  much easier to defend against manipulation, when we’re aware of the myriad
  ways that we _can_ be manipulated.


  Try it yourself. Google some of your favourite brands, and see if you like
  what you find. Make sure to look past the first few pages, as those companies
  use search engine optimization to hide any unsavoury details. Easier still,
  have a gander at the nutritional label of your favourite health bar. Does it
  have a “healthy” sugar and saturated fat content? Is it loaded with
  unpronounceable chemical ingredients?
f_conclusion: >-
  _Brandwashed_ is a must-read for every consumer, and that’s just about
  everyone on the planet. Lindstrom will help you become a savvy and informed
  consumer who thinks twice about your brand and product choices. After reading
  this book, you will never look at another billboard, commercial, or magazine
  ad the same way again.

_Brandwashed_ airs the advertising industry’s dirty laundry. Written as an exposé, Martin Lindstrom cites example after example of the manipulative ways marketers use to persuade unwitting consumers to buy. He reveals the psychological, emotional, and rational tricks that advertisers employ, such as using sex, fear, peer pressure, and nostalgia. Interestingly, both consumers and marketers can gain significant value from the book’s lessons.
