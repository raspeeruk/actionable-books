  ### Creat(ive) Distance


  > "First and foremost, I get up and walk away."- Breakthrough!, page 20


  You’re stuck. You’ve made a few false starts then trashed what you’ve created.
  You keep coming back to ideas that haven’t worked in the past. You’re still
  stuck.


  The thought occurs to you to take a break. How will that help, when you have
  so much work to do?


  Many of the 90 creative types shared that walking away from the work helps
  them to move past the creative block. Tim Navis, a photographer, will pack his
  car, point to a spot on the map and drive there. While this might be
  impractical, there are other ways to get distance from our block:


  *   Find a more inspiring place to think or work

  *   Take a walk

  *   Stop actively working on the project – do something else

  *   Listen to airport traffic information


  I’m not an artist, but I recently realized the value of allowing myself my own
  creative process for my work. For example, I’m working on designing a course
  and what I find works well is to read the documents, make some notes and then
  go for a walk. _Taking a walk is not my break – it’s part of my working
  process._

  ### Fight It!


  > "Creative block is closely connected to fear: fear of my ideas not being
  good enough."- Breakthrough!, page 80


  Kim Holm, Motion Designer and Digital Artist, puts forth the idea that
  creative block is a result of losing confidence in the idea. Kim believes that
  when the fear kicks in, it’s a sign that the idea really has merit and it’s
  time to push through.


  How can we push through?


  Tom Balchin, Graphic Designer, says “I asked a copywriter once how he overcame
  writer’s block. His advice was to just keep writing, even if it was gibberish.
  If you can keep pace with your production of ideas, then you can go back and
  edit it down to something more meaningful.”


  Many creatives expressed the same idea in different ways. Forcing yourself to
  keep producing will ultimately break down the barrier created by your mind.  

  We all have the possibility to find our creative flow when we’re stuck. Next
  time you find yourself staring at a blank computer screen, try stepping away,
  redefining the problem or trying something new. Give yourself the freedom to
  do what works to move from block to blockbuster!

  ### Reframe the Problem


  > "Take the problem that’s handed to you and redefine it in a way you find
  compelling, intriguing or exciting."- Breakthrough!, page 22


  Paul Madonna, illustrator and cartoonist, says that the creative process has
  two parts: generating ideas and choosing tools to express those ideas.


  If you’re stuck on a task and need to generate ideas, try addressing it in a
  different way, using one of the tips proposed by the creative types in
  _Breakthrough!_:


  *   Ask yourself questions that provoke a different way of thinking about the
  problem, such as, “how would \[insert famous idol\] approach this question?”
  “How would I write this if I were writing for children?”

  *   Talk with someone about it. Just describing the issue out loud might give
  you a new perspective, or the thoughts of another may spark your brilliant
  solution.

  *   Open a book. Any book. Stare at a random sentence and consider how it
  relates to the issue you’re trying to resolve.


  The key here is to realize the need to generate ideas and find an engaging way
  to explore your topic.

  Take solace in knowing that you are not alone: it happens to everyone and is
  an unavoidable part of the creative process."

Have you ever sat in front of a blank computer screen, wondering where to start? That wondering means you have a choice – the freedom of how to approach the task at hand. Many of us have aspects of our jobs that require us to be creative. Whether we are writing a report, creating a presentation or planning an event, creative blocks can happen to anyone.

_Breakthrough!,_ edited by Alex Cornell, offers 90 different perspectives for overcoming creative blocks. Though the entries have been provided by people with jobs classified as “creative”, such as graphic designers and artists, the ideas within this book can be applied to a range of professions, including marketing, sales, business owners and more.

The book is light reading and beautiful. It’s a resource that I can see myself dipping into when I need inspiration. By opening to a random page, I’ll land on an insight from someone in a creative profession, such as Ji Lee, Creative Director of Facebook.

Insights range from a deeper look at creative blocks (is your creative block simply your fear of your ideas not being good enough?) through crazy ways to stimulate thought (coffee right before bed) to straightforward tips (such as clearly identifying a deliverable).
