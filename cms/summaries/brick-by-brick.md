  ### Act Authentically


  > "By restoring the company’s fundamental values, he laid the foundation for
  an innovation culture that put the retailer first; that focused designers as
  well as managers on creating only those toys that stood an odds-on chance of
  generating substantial profits; that revived the enduring LEGO product lines
  that appealed to kids who loved to build; that championed inside-the-box
  creativity; that challenged people to do more with less; and that pushed
  people to act authentically by showing instead of telling."- Brick By Brick,
  page 120


  LEGO is well-known for the interlocking blocks with nearly infinite
  possibilities. The brick is a creativity catalyst inspiring a wide range of
  creations. The blocks are useful at all skill levels from preschool to
  Mensa-level hiring tests at Google. LEGO’s primary focus was 5-9 year-old boys
  who have made up their core consumers since the 1970’s. Market research showed
  that two-thirds of that group don’t play with construction toys. To capture
  more of the target market, LEGO developed toys that were not brick-based or
  recognizably LEGO. Unfortunately, customers buying LEGO products expected
  construction toys and the new products alienated them and failed to attract
  the new customers they targeted.


  Within the company, designers decided that “LEGO is an idea, not a category”
  which freed them to develop innovative products but took away their focus.
  While breaking from its traditional product, it also broke with its
  fundamental values and became ineffective. LEGO had to act authentically to
  reconnect with its identity and reconnect with core customers. They focused
  their goal on creating products that were “recognizably LEGO, but have never
  been seen before.” Acting authentically builds credibility that drives
  customer support and fosters an impactful, innovative company culture.

  ### Shared Vision Binds the Organization


  > "And that meant reconnecting with one of the LEGO Group’s most animating
  values, Ole Kirk’s dictum that ‘only the best is good enough.’ In recent
  years, LEGO staffers had grown to disparage the motto, believing it had
  significantly slowed the development process by encouraging designers to
  dither over products, overcomplicating and overdesigning them. Perfecting had
  gotten in the way of acting. But Knudstorp revived the motto and gave it more
  of a direct translation from the Danish: ‘even the best is not good enough."-
  Brick By Brick, page 147


  Having a “Shared Vision” unified LEGO’s business practices. LEGO was slow to
  release new products; the development process took about 3 years because there
  were too many approvals required in the design process. Management had no
  tolerance for failure or dissent, and LEGO’s motto had become linked to the
  perfectionistic process. Their autocratic management style hobbled creativity.
  LEGO needed to realign the business vision to foster creativity in product
  development.


  A simple motto is an easy way to connect everyone. By saying, “only the best
  is good enough,” LEGO implied everything must be perfect, which is a standard
  that is arguably never achievable and stifles creativity. But the revised
  motto, “even the best is not good enough” implies that they are always growing
  and developing better products. This small shift changes expectations across
  all areas of the business.

  ### Connect to Core Customers


  > "LEGO had launched so many new initiatives that Knudstorp believed it had
  forsaken a ‘crisp sense of identity’; the end result was a ‘loss of
  confidence’ in the company’s direction and its capacity to execute. It was one
  thing to get back to the brick and reconnect with 5-9 year-old boys. It was
  quite another to dig deeper and try to discover the company’s unshakable,
  inviolable core"- Brick By Brick, page 130


  While pursuing new initiatives, LEGO refused outside ideas and isolated itself
  from its core customers. LEGO reconnected with customers by directly
  interacting with them. Designers tested new toys by carefully observing
  children playing with them. They allowed the children to become co-creators
  and guide their development. Ideas that didn’t work went to “lost ideas”
  binders for inspiration at another time.


  LEGO had previously ignored adult enthusiasts, considering them a fringe
  group. However, they discovered a substantial number of adult customers
  primarily interested in more complex sets. LEGO partnered with enthusiasts to
  foster open innovation. Hackers broke the code on LEGO’s robotics software for
  Mindstorms. Instead of treating the fans like criminals, LEGO encouraged them
  to reinvent by providing a free downloadable software development kit. They
  also partnered with teams and individual enthusiasts which not only
  strengthened their fan base but also led to inventions LEGO would never have
  imagined.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Brick by Brick_ is a remarkably detailed account of LEGO’s business practices
  illustrating both how bad practices devastate a successful organization and
  how LEGO successfully remade itself into a thriving, innovative company.
  Although this is not a blueprint for any group that wants to become more
  creative, it does offer many widely applicable and helpful ideas. A good first
  step is to act authentically, create a shared vision and build credibility
  within the company. Once you’ve connected to fundamental values, then focus on
  a core product and core customers. Authenticity is a firm basis to develop
  innovative initiatives that work.

LEGO produced its first blocks in 1949, and it has grown to become an iconic building block toy. From 1998 to 2003 the company released diverse product lines and explored other lines of business, and amid accolades for innovation, it nearly collapsed. In _Brick by Brick: How LEGO Rewrote the Rules of Innovation and Conquered the Global Toy Industry_, David C. Robertson and Bill Breen explore the reasons LEGO declined, their process of recovery, and how they built a flourishing, innovative, and resilient company.

LEGO founded its business on simple principles that connected it to its product and customer. However, LEGO lost connection with its values. Management was disconnected and controlling, they lost track of profits and losses, they lost focus pursuing many initiatives, designers worked independently without constraints, they hired people with the wrong skills, they devalued core products and lost brand recognition, and lost touch with retailers and customers. It took radical changes and the “seven truths of innovation” to set the company on the right track.

Regaining authenticity was pivotal to LEGO’s recovery. _Brick by Brick_ provides an in-depth look at LEGO’s foundation, what led to a crisis and near financial ruin, and the innovative process that led to re-creating a thriving company. For this summary, I’ll focus on authenticity.
