  ### Treat your audience with respect


  > "Being brief is not just about time. What's more important is how long it
  feels to the audience."- Brief, page 9


  Ultimately, McCormack maintains that brevity is a practical application of the
  Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. He argues that
  brevity will make your speaking, your selling and your leadership more
  effective. But, more than that it is a way of treating your audience well.


  After all, that is what makes a brief person more effective, her audience
  appreciates the respect she shows for their time. She has done the hard work
  to synthesize the details into exactly what the audience would deem most
  relevant.


  One of the key insights I’ve noticed multiple times in conversations has to do
  with the level of detail. McCormack maintains there are three levels of detail
  to any story. First level details represent those things central to your
  communication. Second level details add color and perhaps some clarity. Third
  level details are true, but add little to your case. Focus, he says, on level
  one details. Use level two sparingly and avoid level three details altogether.
  For instance, I used only level one details when I told my wife about the
  spider. Only when I added some second level details did she relax.

  ### Start by listening


  > "What you're talking about matters to the person you're talking to, and your
  active listening tells you what matters to that person. You have the other
  person's interest and assent."- Brief, page 81


  Listening to other people is the simplest way to craft your message to give
  them just what they need. He goes so far as to recommend appointing someone as
  the “active listener” at meetings. This person’s responsibility is to make
  sure concerns are heard and questions are answered. The active listener
  prevents conversations from swirling around the room, taking bunny trails and
  never landing on the most important topics.


  He recommends two tactics for active listening: Ask open-ended questions
  connected to what you’ve heard. A well-crafted question will generate more
  information to help you focus your message. And, tap into the parts of the
  topic you’re genuinely interested in. Your own interest will keep you active
  as you listen.


  Most people, though they’d never admit it, don’t listen – they wait to talk.
  He suggests that if someone interrupts you, let them. They weren’t listening
  anyway.

  ### Long story short


  > "The secret of a good sermon is to have a good beginning and a good ending,
  and to have the two as close together as possible."- George Burns, as quoted
  in Brief, page 133


  McCormack used (not only taught) several techniques for achieving brevity that
  I will commend here. “Long story short” served as a way of summarizing each
  section. If I only had time to skim I could get the most important parts by
  finding that key phrase. He used pictures. In each section he had pictures of
  an army man with some relevant quote or saying. Beside each picture was a
  quick summary of the key idea he was trying to communicate. If a picture is
  worth a thousand words, one should expect visuals to enhance brevity. He chose
  acronyms and headlines to summarize and make reading easy.


  I am a pastor, I preach a sermon almost every week. And, I admit the George
  Burns quote above stings. Yet, I’ve been doing it for over 20 years and have
  never received a complaint for being too short! McCormack does recommend one
  thing preachers have done for centuries — the rule of three’s: He says,
  “Organize information in groups of three to keep order, attention, and
  balance.” \[Carmine Gallo recommends the same technique. See the [_Talk Like
  Ted_ summary](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/talk-like-ted/).\]


  Other important times to keep a long story short include performance reviews,
  saying “no”, selling and, of course, the “elevator pitch.”

  Though I am tempted to go on and on, the book is about being BRIEF! Say more
  by saying less.

> "If you want to make a bigger impact, decide to give your audience less." _\- Brief, page 216_

Actionable Books is built on the premise that one must use what one reads. Take action. Don’t let an idea just sit there. So I did. I put Joseph McCormack’s _Brief: Making a Bigger Impact by Saying Less_ into action. I kept it brief. I said more with less.

The other morning, I rolled over to my wife and said, “I killed a spider on my pillow last night.” Then I got up and walked away.

Knowing my audience, I got the desired effect. Let me say, my wife was very interested in everything I had to say the rest of that morning! I might as well have announced the house was on fire! There is power in brevity.

Though I am tempted to go on and on, the book is about being BRIEF! Say more by saying less.

Ultimately you have to make a choice, a choice to respect your audience, not to hear yourself talk. The primary contention of the book is that people will thank you. You will be more effective because of the good will and clarity gained by brevity.

Think of your next talk or meeting. What can you cut out or trim to be more effective?
