  ### Your customer’s story must be central to your marketing


  > "n every line of copy we write, we’re either serving the customer’s story or
  descending into confusion; we’re either making music or making noise."-
  Building a StoryBrand, page 24


  Many, if not most, companies spend their marketing energy and dollars
  conveying an excess of information about their products and their company.
  This is often confusing to the customer and boring. What the consumer really
  needs to know, in simple terms, is how the company can make a positive
  difference in their own lives.


  How many websites, and other marketing pieces, have you seen where the company
  goes on and on, page after page, telling you about their products? How many
  products they produce, how they produce them, where they produce them, the
  processes they use, what ingredients/components are used, why their products
  are superior to those produced by other companies, etc.


  How many times have you seen a beautiful website where the company provides
  numerous links, pictures, diagrams, videos in an effort to educate the
  consumer? Quite often this results in too much information for the potential
  customer to absorb so they exit the website and never return.


  During his first stint at Apple, Steve Jobs led the company in the launch of
  the “Lisa” computer. They ran a nine-page ad in the New York Times explaining
  all the technical details of the computer. The ad campaign failed and the
  computer sold poorly. A couple years later, after being forced out of Apple,
  Jobs invested in and helped create “the genius storytelling factory that is
  Pixar”. His years at Pixar transformed his marketing approach as he learned
  how important the art of storytelling is to capture the attention of the
  customer.


  When he returned to Apple, Jobs lead the company in their efforts to study and
  identify who their customers were and what they needed. This customer-centric
  focus resulted in their very successful, two-word campaign, _“Think
  Different”_ which appeared on billboards everywhere. Today, Apple continues to
  excel in creating marketing stories that engage the imagination of customers
  everywhere.

  ### Ask for the sale, repeatedly


  > "The reality is when we try to sell passively, we communicate a lack of
  belief in our product. When we don’t ask clearly for the sale, the customer
  senses weakness."- Building a StoryBrand, page 98


  Many companies seem almost apologetic when asking for the sale. They end up
  underselling because they fear overselling. This results in a marketing
  message where the company appears unsure of their value. But customers want to
  do business with a company that is confident in the value of their products
  and services and knows the positive changes it can make in the lives of its
  customers. This company asks for the sale and they ask multiple times. On
  their webpage, they’ll feature multiple “Buy Now” buttons, giving the
  potential customer multiple opportunities to buy.

  ### Focus on one thing


  > "The most important challenge for business leaders is to define something
  simple and relevant their customers want and to become known for delivering on
  that promise."- Building a StoryBrand, page 49


  It’s critical for a business to identify the gap between where the customer is
  and where they want to be, or what they don’t have but want to have. In what
  way can they best help that customer? Many businesses offer multiple products
  or multiple solutions, but the best strategy is to focus on one need and
  become known for delivering a solution for that one need before adding a
  second and third set of solutions.


  Potential customers should be able to tell you exactly how a company’s
  products or services will help them. If they can’t, it’s probably because the
  company provides a lot of random information and no clear message about how
  they can help them. And, a confused consumer won’t buy.

  Author Donald Miller lays out guidelines any company can use to create their
  own “storybrand”. Using his roadmap, companies can create a new marketing
  story where their potential customer becomes the hero (vs. the company) and
  the company becomes the guide who can help them win.

> “Story is the greatest weapon we have to combat noise, because it organizes information in such a way that people are compelled to listen.” _\- Building a StoryBrand, page 16_

Today’s consumer is bombarded with thousands of pieces of information every single day. Information overload is the new “normal”. This constant stream of noise coming at us is too much for us to deal with and so, more and more, we are tuning out, not listening, not watching. We’re constantly filtering all of this information and we only pay attention when we perceive something will help us, or our loved ones, survive and/or thrive.

Donald Miller’s _Building a StoryBrand_ is a formula that any business, large or small, can use to reach out to and engage the consumer, no matter how much information overload they are suffering from. He will teach you how to market your brand by telling stories that your ideal client will want to listen to.
