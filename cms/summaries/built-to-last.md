  ### Start With Why


  > "Visionary companies do not ask, 'What should we value?' They ask, “What do
  we actually value deep down to our toes?"- Built to Last, page 8


  Visionary companies live and breathe their ideology – a set of core values and
  a sense of purpose. By clearly defining their “why,” visionary companies are
  then able to produce the right “what” (products and services), attract the
  right “who” (employees and leaders), and develop the right “how” (policies and
  processes) to create an environment that breeds the kind of success that
  outlasts and outperforms their competition.


  What’s interesting to note is that the visionary companies explored in _Built
  to Last_ each had a different “why” and yet they all achieved resounding
  success. Collins and Porras discovered that the key commonality was their
  relentless commitment to their ideologies. Ideology spans decades, endures
  through leadership changes, provides direction when faced with difficult
  decisions, and prevails despite being unpopular or unprofitable at the time.


  In short, ideology is king. “What,” “who,” and “how” lack purpose, direction,
  and clarity without “why.” Careful articulation and consistent application of
  “why” form the foundation of visionary companies.

  ### Walk the Talk


  > "The very act of stating a core ideology (which the visionary companies have
  done to a far greater degree than the comparison companies) influences
  behaviour toward consistency with that ideology."- Built to Last, page 71


  Now it’s time to put it to the test. What good is your personal manifesto if
  it’s not put into action? This is not an easy feat. You’ll find that there may
  be a mismatch between your ideal state and your current state. For example, if
  you value “honesty,” do you believe there are instances when it is best to
  lie? Are you honest even if it hurts someone you care about? Have you ever
  stretched the truth for your own gain?


  The disconnect can be resolved in two ways:


  *   You understand and accept that you don’t value “honesty” as highly as you
  think you do, so you rank it lower on your list in order to focus more of your
  time and energy on your most important values.

  *   If you really do value “honesty” that highly, then you need to modify your
  actions to align with that belief.


  In either case, resolving the disconnect increases consistency, which is
  critical when it comes to ideologies and personal manifestos. Visionary
  companies display unrelenting commitment to their ideology. Values-driven
  individuals such as Martin Luther King, Mahatma Ghandi, or Mother Teresa
  displayed similar dedication to their beliefs, despite strongly opposing
  forces. In a world of constant change and moral gray areas, individuals who
  publicly and consistently live out their values will stand out in a
  significant way and – in a world of limitless choice and increased competition
  – that makes all the difference in achieving personal and professional
  success.

  ### What's On Your Banner?


  > "If we’re not going to live by it, let’s tear it off the wall… We either
  ought to commit to it or get rid of it."- Former CEO Jim Burke, on Merck’s
  ideology, quoted in Built to Last, page 72


  A visionary company’s relentless commitment to its ideology can be applied to
  a more personal level – to an individual and her personal manifesto. Why is
  having a personal manifesto important? It acts as a filter through the noise.
  Making decisions is made easier because it automatically eliminates any
  possibilities that aren’t aligned with your core values. We all have limited
  time, energy, and resources, which makes a high level of self-awareness
  important for determining which activities and goals to pursue in order to
  maximize happiness and fulfillment.


  Your personal manifesto says, “This is who I am, and this is what I stand for.
  Take it or leave it.” It goes beyond simply a list of things that you think
  are important. It embodies your _core_ values and beliefs ­– things that you
  feel so strongly about that you would fly them on a banner above your head.
  These values and beliefs help define you as a person and play a significant
  role in what makes you unique.


  I challenge you to create your personal manifesto. Start by writing down a
  list of 20 values. Remember that not all values are created equally, so you
  should review the list and rank them from 1 through 20. Then run the list by a
  close friend or family member who knows you well and is not afraid to be
  bluntly honest with you, as we all suffer from varying levels of
  self-awareness. The top 3 to 6 values will form your personal manifesto. This
  exercise in self-reflection is key to finding happiness and fulfillment –in
  your personal and professional life.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Built to Last_ proves to be a compelling read for entrepreneurs seeking to
  build their own visionary companies and for business professionals seeking to
  be a part of, (and contribute to), visionary companies. At the very least, it
  provides the reader with valuable insights and anecdotal stories about
  companies that have changed our world and touch our lives every day.

In Jim Collins’ **prequel** to his blockbuster [_Good to Great_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/good-to-great/), he and Porras explore the characteristics of visionary companies – companies that not only made the leap from good to great, but also sustained remarkable success over a significant period of time. Founded in rigorous research and analysis (6 years’ worth, to be exact), _Built to Last_ stands out from other general business books that comprise of mostly jargon and platitudes.

By matching each “visionary” company (e.g. General Electric) with a “comparison” company (e.g. Westinghouse) – companies that were founded around the same time, in a similar industry, with access to similar resources and opportunities – Collins and Porras discovered the fundamental principles that make “visionary” companies so unique. Furthermore, they demonstrate how these elite companies shattered 12 common, widely held business myths to achieve and sustain their “visionary” status.
