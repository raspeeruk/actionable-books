  ### Don't generalize, specialize


  > "If you focus on doing one thing well and hire specialists in that area, the
  quality of your work will improve and you will stand out among your
  competitors."- Built to Sell, page 17


  There’s nothing wrong with being a consultant. Or a freelancer for that
  matter. Both of them can make a decent living listening intently to the needs
  of their clients and then creating custom solutions to address those needs.
  They make customers very happy that way. **But they’re not building
  businesses**.


  _Built to Sell_ is a story – a story about a fictional business owner named
  Alex Stapleton who runs a small design agency (The Stapleton Agency). The
  agency does everything their clients want, from websites and Search Engine
  Optimization to posters and radio commercials. As a small shop, they have a
  small staff, and as the small staff is required to know how to do everything,
  Alex Stapleton leads a team of generalists.


  20 years ago this would have been less of a problem. Hemmed in by geography,
  most clients in need of a design agency would go to the one in town. And it
  was good, in those days, if you could address their varied needs. That’s
  changed.


  As we’ve discussed so many times before, we’re now competing on a global
  landscape, no matter how large or small we are. As such, we need to be the
  very best in order to stand out. If we’re not the best, we’re competing on
  price (and we’re going to get killed). How do you get to be the best,
  especially when you’re the little guy? You go niche. Specific. Absolutely
  brilliant at one thing. For Alex Stapleton and his team, that one thing was
  designing logos. It really doesn’t matter what it is you choose to specialize
  in, so long as there’s a demand for it and you can work towards doing it with
  excellence, consistently. Which leads us to our first GEM…

  ### Stay specialized


  > "Clients will test your resolve every day. They're used to bossing their
  service providers around and, if given the choice, would always prefer you
  customize your solution just for them. If you want to sell your business, you
  can't give in. ... You can't be 'kind of' a specialist."- Built to Sell, page
  30


  This was the hard part for me – learning to say **no**. Of course clients want
  customization; they assume the rules don’t apply to them. You need to stay
  strong. As Warrillow says in the quote above, “you can’t be “kind of” a
  specialist.” Heart surgeons don’t occasionally do knee surgery. Could they?
  Maybe. But that’s not their gig. And they’re not getting any better – any more
  credible – as a heart surgeon if they’re messing around with other procedures.
  You’re not a heart surgeon (I’m assuming), but you can build a reputation as
  an expert. You just need to stay strong, and stay away from projects that
  dilute your business offering.

  ### Develop your process


  > "Ted's Tip #3: Owning a process makes it easier to pitch and puts you in
  control. Be clear about what you're selling, and potential customers will be
  more likely to buy your product."- Built to Sell, page 23


  I like the fact that Warrillow used a design agency as the business example in
  his story. Can you think of a more “creative”, unstructured, un-process-driven
  environment than a creative agency? And yet, create a process is exactly what
  Alex does. (FYI, the “Ted” in “Ted’s Tip #3” refers to the Yoda-like mentor in
  _Built to Sell_; the gentleman who guides Alex through the process of
  structuring the business to sell)


  When you develop a process, you gain significantly in two crucial areas:


  1.  **You can scale.** It’s a heck of a lot easier to teach employees how to
  _do what you do_ when it’s detailed and documented. You can also teach
  employees how to _sell like you do_ when you have a process.

  2.  **You can manage cashflow more effectively**. Having a process is like
  having a product. People are used to paying for products up front (or at least
  in instalments), meaning you can charge and _then_ do the work. Also, when you
  have a process, you have a standard price for it. Knowing that price makes it
  clearer how many sales you need to bring in each month.

  So what’s the benefit here? We’re saying no to clients, we’re limiting the
  scope of our offering, and we’re documenting (in excruciating detail)
  everything that we do in our “process”. **We’re also building a business**.
  Whether you choose to sell, choose to scale back your personal involvement, or
  simply choose to use the process to streamline and grow your business, these
  “tips” really aren’t optional for entrepreneurs. Like I said earlier, there’s
  nothing wrong with being a consultant or a freelancer. But you’re not an
  entrepreneur unless you’re building a business that can thrive without you.
  And that takes discipline.

I almost didn’t read _Built to Sell_. Sure, I’d heard great things, but since I have no intention of selling my business anytime soon, I thought, “There’s definitely more relevant books for me to read out there, right?”

I was mistaken. I don’t care if you’re actively trying to sell your business, or simply have a dream of one day starting your own business; if you’re ever planning on being an entrepreneur, I **highly** recommend you read John Warrillow’s _Built to Sell_. Because here’s the logic –

_Certain over-priced dot-coms and fire-sales aside, people typically want to buy healthy companies. Cash flow positive companies. Companies that can run without their founder. Companies that can be scaled and grown. And, if you’re an entrepreneur, isn’t that exactly the type of company you’d like to be running?_ **_Even if you have no intention to sell?_** _Yup, me too._

So, since we’re on the same page – wanting to build scalable, cash generating businesses that can survive without our involvement on every little thing – you’re going to want to pay attention here. Warrillow says some stuff that goes against the very fibre of my “customer-centric” being… but he’s right.
