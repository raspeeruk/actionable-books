  ### Failure's a Part of the Game


  > "The notion that you can get rich from one brilliant idea is a commonly held
  dream that whenever someone actually seems to have done it, the media eagerly
  embraces the story. Unfortunately, media coverage offers an extremely
  distorted view of reality."- Business Brilliant, page 68


  When polled for the book, 7 out of 10 middle class respondents agreed that
  perseverance was important to long-term success, but only **2** out of 10
  believed that failure was also important.


  As Schiff comments in _Business Brilliant,_ “the trouble with this line of
  thinking is that perseverance can’t exist without failure. Who perseveres in
  the face of success?”


  Think about how broken this logic is. Most of us agree that perseverance is
  important; a virtue worthy of praise and recognition, but at the same time
  aren’t willing to embrace the very experience – failure – that allows us to
  persevere. Perseverance **requires** failure, yet we’ve demonized the idea of
  failure, turning it into a four letter word; something ugly, shameful and to
  avoid at all costs.


  If we truly are in the pursuit of greatness – financially or otherwise – we
  need to reframe our beliefs and views around failure… so let’s explore how to
  do that.

  ### Talk it out


  > "Discussions about failure are almost always more productive than
  discussions about successes."- Business Brilliant, page 170


  No one likes failure. Millionaire or middle class, we’re all human, and we
  like the wins. That’s normal. But when failure does occur (and it should, from
  time to time, if you’re involved in work worth doing) the **worst** thing we
  can do is brush it under the rug and forget it ever happened. As painful as it
  might be, we need to learn from the experience so we can do better next time.
  Failing once at something is healthy. Making the same mistake over and over is
  foolish. The best way to ensure failure is profitable? Talk it out. Gather the
  people involved in the project into a room together with enough time to really
  get into it. Have a clear objective of pulling as much value from the
  experience as possible (and an equally clear mandate that this is **not**
  about placing blame).


  I’ve found this exercise so valuable in our own business here at Actionable
  that we’ve integrated a conversation guide into our ongoing quarterly
  retreats. I also appreciate that discussing failure is _not_ something we’re
  naturally inclined to do. Which is maybe why it’s so valuable? What I do know
  is that it gets easier each time you do it. I know your team grows stronger,
  more aligned and more open to exploring the unknown together. I know we’re
  better – personally and professionally – when we can openly discuss our
  failures and grow through them. I believe the self-made millionaires
  referenced in _Business Brilliant_ would agree.

  ### Expect Multiples


  > "…for most middle-class people, failure is something they have experienced
  either never or just once."- Business Brilliant, page 152


  Another fascinating insight from the _Business Brilliant_ research was that
  while most self-made millionaires fail an average of **three times** in their
  professional careers, the rest of us are failing **once or not at all**.


  Seth Godin told a story once about marching a hot-shot Director of his company
  up in front of the rest of the team and publically asking when that employee
  had last failed at something professionally. When the individual couldn’t
  think of anything, Seth challenged him to fail in a big way within the next 6
  months… or he could find another job.


  Sounds counterintuitive, right? I mean, what person _wants_ to fail? What
  company or company owner wants their employee to fail at something? Failure is
  bad, right? Wrong.


  Failure borne of ineptitude or laziness is bad. Failure in something we’ve
  been doing for years is bad. We should know better. But failure in the face of
  unknown circumstances – failure when we’re trying something new – is almost
  inevitable. Activities and projects that have a higher degree of risk come
  with higher rewards. This is basic supply and demand economics: the less
  people that make it through the gauntlet of challenge, the bigger the reward
  is on the other side.


  If the project you’re considering has little-to-no chance of failure, you
  really have to ask yourself, “_Is this worth doing in the first place?_” **Is
  it going to have an impact?**


  Give yourself permission to fail. Say at the outset, “This might not work.”
  You remove the pressure to be perfect in the face of unknowns, and it allows
  you to get down to the matter of creating something exceptional.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are a number of differences in beliefs, behaviours and attitudes between
  self-made millionaires and the rest of us, but the line is finer than you may
  imagine. At the end of the day it seems to me that the most successful among
  us are willing to take intelligent risks, push through when the going gets
  tough, and be willing to admit failures and learn from them. And **that**
  sounds like something we can all get better at, if we’re willing to step up
  and live at a bigger level.

> "The belief that failure is necessary for success, a belief shared among self-made millionaires but not among the middle class, could be the most important finding our survey has uncovered." _\- Business Brilliant, page 167_

Lewis Schiff’s _Business Brilliant_ is a study of the behaviour and psychological differences between self-made millionaires and the middle class. It could be a fluffy book about tenacity and creativity. It’s not. Instead, _Business Brilliant_ offers powerful – and often surprising – insights and best practices that we can **all** benefit from applying to our lives, whether our goals are financial or otherwise. Schiff dives deep into a number of topics that most of us could brush up on – negotiation skills, delegation, focusing on high-leverage tasks, and goal setting (to name a few) – but perhaps most interesting (and most applicable), was the insights shared on the self-made millionaires beliefs around failure.
