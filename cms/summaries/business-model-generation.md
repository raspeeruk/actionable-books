  ### Business Models as a Tool for Evaluating Possible Change


  > "Mapping an existing business model is one thing; designing a new and
  innovative business model is another. What’s needed is a creative process for
  generating a large number of business model ideas and successfully isolating
  the best ones."- Business Model Generation, page 136


  It is hard to find an expert that is stating, these days, that the pace of
  change of business is slowing. It is generally accepted that the pace of
  change is accelerating and many experts expect that this will continue to be
  the case for the foreseeable future. Things like advancements in technology,
  communications, and transport logistics are all key contributors. The
  Internet, including various social media sites, have allowed for collaboration
  and advancement of ideas at a pace never seen before. All of this places
  greater and greater pressure on businesses to advance to meet the new needs,
  demands and pressures of the changing economy. Strategic planning becomes
  hugely challenging at times like this.


  Traditional strategic planning cycles, which take a great deal of time and
  documentation provided by planning members who are also busy with the regular
  day-to-day aspects of their jobs, are becoming less and less relevant in this
  fast-moving environment. What is needed is a tool to quickly capture
  sufficient relevant information about a business change to evaluate the impact
  to the business that would be implied. The Business Plan Canvas template
  (below; click to enlarge) is an excellent example of a tool that gives a quick
  but holistic overview of a proposed change, along with predicted outcomes. By
  using this template, the business management team can quickly look at one or
  more change alternatives to effectively evaluate the best course of action to
  take. The patterns can be used for looking at ‘out of the box’ alternatives
  when looking at how to successfully evolve a business. Great business models
  explaining these examples help see when and how they can be effectively
  applied. Business can quickly build plans for effecting the required change,
  based on the Business Model Canvas.

  While these tools can be used reactively in order to determine what best to do
  in reaction to something that has happened in the business environment, more
  importantly, the book suggests that the same tools and techniques can be used
  proactively to create strategic plans with sufficient flexibility to be
  resilient to most change through consistent re-evaluation.

  ### Business Model Generation as an Ongoing Process


  > "In today’s climate, it’s best to assume that most business models, even
  successful ones, will have a short lifespan."- Business Model Generation, page
  248


  Imagine a business environment where tools were in place to easily discuss
  business models in a holistic manner without an onerous amount of effort to
  create the model. Suddenly you are looking at an environment where it is
  easier to talk strategy. That ease with which strategy can be discussed
  creates an environment where it simply makes sense to discuss strategy and
  strategic changes routinely. It quickly and organically becomes part of the
  process of doing business. It becomes hard to imagine a world where there
  isn’t a process in place to evolve strategy on a regular basis. A business
  operating in this manner is well poised to deal with the increasing change of
  pace we are all dealing with.


  The book takes the reader through the process of making business model
  generation a regular management activity. The proposed process consists of:


  *   Mobilizing the team appropriate to generate the appropriate business model

  *   Understand the business opportunity to be modelled

  *   Design an appropriate business model

  *   Implement the changes to the business that the model dictates

  *   Manage the business based on the new model, complete with feedback
  measurements to evaluate the success of the model.


  Once this process is embraced, it becomes easy for the business to do
  strategic analysis of their potentials to land on an optimized strategic plan
  which they can realistically execute.

  ### Using Business Models to Evaluate Alternate Strategies


  > "A competitive business that makes sense in today’s environment might be
  outdated or obsolete tomorrow… Of course we can’t be certain of the future… We
  can, however, develop a number of hypotheses about the future to serve as
  guidelines for designing tomorrow’s business models."- Business Model
  Generation, page 210


  There may be two, three, or four (or even more) possible future paths for a
  given business at a given point in time. When a simple yet relevant business
  model is created for each possible path, each can be compared for relative
  value and likelihood of success. Of course, traditional long-cycle business
  model documents make this an onerous task, not likely to be pursued.


  This allows the business to strategically evaluate options and choose the path
  that is best suited to their future success. Options can include status quo
  type answers to the change required, or it can also include more ‘out of the
  box’ type solutions based on patterns (see insight #2) or by the thinking of
  members of the planning team. Continuous use of models to evaluate future
  business paths result in a strategic plan for the business that is based on
  business model generation. This is the process of going from reactive planning
  to truly strategic thinking, to begin anticipating appropriate change before
  external forces demand change of you. This allows for a more nimble planning
  cycle which gives more time to be spent on the creative process part of
  strategic planning, rather than on the administrative and documentation side
  of the process.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Business Model Generation_ provides insight and motivation to not just
  embrace creating a business model but, by using their tools and techniques,
  use business models to design strategies for business. Once the business
  embraces the concept of business modeling, the book takes the reader through
  the rationalization for embracing business modeling as a continuous process.
  This book provides valuable material for making business modeling a practical
  part of managing business for success.

For many executives, business model generation is a difficult but necessary activity, to be endured on rare occasions. Typically the only times business models would be generated would be when the business started, when significant change is anticipated (i.e. the sale of some subset of the business), or when refinancing is required. These models were created using massive spreadsheets with several poorly documented assumptions. They often did not provide a holistic view of the business and focussed primarily on the numbers specific to one aspect of the business.

_Business Model Generation_, written and collaborated on by a team of over 470 practitioners, takes a fresh approach to the activity of business modeling. The book proposes the use of a “Business Model Canvas” which provides a simple but holistic view of a business and its value chain. This business model canvas template asks the reader to consider all aspects of all of the following areas:

*   Key Activities (KA)
*   Key Partners (KP)
*   Key Resources (KR)
*   Cost Structure (CS)
*   Customer Relationships (CR)
*   Customer Segments (CS)
*   Value Propositions (VP)
*   Channels (CH)
*   Revenue Streams (RS)

The book then covers common patterns and techniques for quickly producing useful business case canvases; canvases that contain sufficient information to be useful by management. Finally, the book looks at the use of these canvases in making strategic decisions and using them as a process for ongoing strategic planning. This idea of a process for continually evaluating strategy is one that is becoming more and more important as the pace of business change becomes faster and faster.
