  ### Uncontrollable Environments


  > "Because they can't change the environment they operate in, companies must
  change their business models (and sometimes create new ones) in order to
  remain competitive."- Business Model You, page 21


  Tim revives the classic example of Blockbuster declaring bankruptcy to prove a
  point. Redbox and Netflix had outmoded the old business model, proving that
  movies and games could be delivered better via the internet, postal mail, and
  vending kiosks than through the traditional retail environment.


  Even with a rough economic climate, technological trends and societal mores
  still shift fast beneath our feet. Whether for-profit, non-profit, or
  government entity, every organization has a business model. The striking
  parallel between companies and people is that they cannot control their
  environment. Just as organizations must evaluate and change their business
  models during unpredictable times, people must change theirs as well.


  You are your most important business model. Only those with strong
  self-knowledge and flexibility can truly grow personally and professionally.


  If you’re already part of a great company or organization, can you spot how it
  has changed and innovated over time? Did it require you to change, too?


  _“Employees who care about the success of the enterprise as a whole (and know
  how to achieve it) are the most valuable workers — and candidates for better
  positions.”_

  ### Transcend Your Mental Model


  > "Everything you perceive about your career, your love life, and your family
  and friends, is not necessarily reality, it's merely your perception of
  reality."- Business Model You, page 166


  Sometimes change is hard because there doesn’t seem to be any other way out.
  Overcome this by altering your perspective and transcending old mental models.
  Our perception of reality is just one angle. Pivot your view a little, and the
  real opportunities begin to appear.


  To demonstrate, Tim presents a clever exercise which just might catch you
  off-guard:


  Imagine a 3×3 dot pattern. The goal of the puzzle is to connect all nine dots
  in four (or less) straight lines… without lifting the pencil. The lines may be
  drawn at any angle, but you cannot exceed more than four straight lines.


  Adhering to limiting beliefs, our minds default to the assumption that you
  _must_ stay within the frame of the nine dots. But do you have to stay
  _within_ the grid? If you break out of that grid, what happens?


  This is a brilliant lesson on _unspoken assumptions_ which radiates into our
  professional lives. Tim brings up a point that the frame — or confines of a
  situation — was invented by someone else. We’re so constantly exposed to it
  that we’ve just silently adopted them as the way things are. This draws upon a
  point in the book _The Art of Possibility_ by Benjamin and Rosamund Zanders:
  that the dilemmas and dead ends we face only _appear_ unsolvable. But enlarge
  the box or change the frame of the situation, and then suddenly the problems
  fall away. A new perspective appears and we discover a new set of
  opportunities.


  There is always more than one way to accomplish something. Do you really know
  all your opportunities? Be brave enough to expand the box and see a new
  hypothesis emerge. Once that happens, the last question rests on you: Will you
  act on it?


  Every time an exercise or experiment from the book is completed (and there’s
  plenty of them), you discover things about your personality and environment
  which you may have overlooked in the past. Your first prototype canvas becomes
  closer to completion. You start to realize that finding a “dream job” takes
  more than confidence and courage; it also requires a different way of thinking
  about your talents and strengths.


  After working through the “canvas” process, you will no doubt want to manifest
  your new business model. Section 4 is titled _Act_ and it is devoted to
  testing and executing, and is full of valuable insights as well.

  ### Knowing the Real You


  > "One problem with others' expectations, though, is that we might adopt them
  as our own; a desire for social acceptance can easily overwhelm our internal
  compasses."- Business Model You, page 88


  Do we remember who we really are?


  Tim suggests we ask ourselves this question before our 20s. This was the time
  when our passions were at their most potent before being smothered by
  passivity, peer pressure and the expectations of others.


  He quotes Marcus Buckingham of _Go Put Your Strengths to Work_ in order to
  illuminate the point: “Your childish clarity faded, and you started listening
  to the world around you more closely than you did to yourself. The world was
  persuasive and loud, and so you resigned yourself to conforming to its
  demands.”


  Sometimes, it’s the ongoing burnout or crises in our lives which make us
  contemplate our true purpose. This deep self-reflection returns us to the
  distant past.


  There are some questions which can kick off this re-discovery. What did we
  love? What invigorated us back then? These may be the games, hobbies, or
  little abilities and fascinations we picked up along the way, but never
  nourished. The trick now is to concoct all these early interests, desires, and
  events from the past, and to see what the _combined significance_ may be in
  the present. This is the _sweet spot._


  _“Reflecting deeply on who you are before crisis strikes rewards both you and
  your customers because it helps prevent burnout and disillusionment. When
  you’re personally satisfied, you’re more able to help others.”_
f_conclusion: >-
  _Business Model You_ is visual and surgical, but it certainly leads to one
  thing: Clarity. It’s truly an architect’s workbook. Reinvent the ways your
  organization serves its stakeholders, or simply prepare yourself to do
  something new. Great organizations can be designed, and so can people’s
  careers. That’s the power of business model thinking and _Business Model You._

People drifting from job to job may soon realize that they’ve visited the same crossroads too many times. Changing careers is tough, but some job seekers may be tired of compromises which would only lead to the same suboptimal choices they’ve experienced in the past. While others may seek to become just employable, these rare and brave souls seek to be remarkable and relevant.

The truth is that they already are. We all are, in fact. And now, there’s a way to tap into that greatness and bring it into the present.

In the spirit of Alexander Osterwalder’s successful book _Business Model Generation (BMG),_ Tim Clark (who was also BMG’s editor) has written _Business Model You: A One Page Method for Reinventing Your Career._ Clark shows that you can use the same business model thinking from BMG to unearth **your** greatest strengths, talents, and interests, and then paint them onto a powerful blueprint.

_Business Model You_ was co-created between 328 entrepreneurial minds spread out over 43 countries. The book is a beautiful designed and succinctly written journey replete with each contributor’s diverse experiences and insight. The common theme is that everyone involved in producing the book struggled, but ultimately succeeded, in reinventing themselves. Their stories will help you paint your personal business model.

What’s a business model? In short, it’s “_the logic by which any organization sustains itself financially.”_ Likewise, the Business Model _“canvas”_ is a structured but simple visual technique which shows how the nine most important components of any business model fit and flow together. First, the original canvas is introduced for enterprises before being translated to the world of the individual.

_Business Model You_ is also an itinerary of thought experiments, anecdotes, and exercises to help align work with purpose. Some of the many experiments include the _Lifeline Discovery_ and _Holland’s Six Tendencies._ This journey of self-knowledge really counts, because aside from financial sustainability and survival, this is a book about thriving and doing the kind of work that resonates at your core.

So why is business model thinking the best way to sharpen yourself in an ever-changing world? What’s really required to develop our _personal_ business model to the fullest?
