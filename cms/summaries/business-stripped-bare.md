  ### Small is the New Big


  > "The common thread running through these ideas is that they're simple -
  simple enough for an individual to take forward and make happen. We all need
  to be aware that small, lean, entrepreneurial businesses are now the future of
  business as a whole."- Business Stripped Bare, page xviii


  I found this point fascinating. Here’s a guy with over 50,000 employees
  worldwide, preaching the value of “staying small”. But he means it. As often
  as is prudent, Branson works to split companies once they reach a certain size
  (100-150 employees, typically). He believes, as I do, that there is incredible
  value that comes from everyone in a company knowing each others’ names, and in
  feeling that their work makes a tangible difference. Of course, the “risk” to
  keeping companies small is a lack of redundancy; everyone needs to pull their
  weight, and truly work towards to the greater good of the company.


  Branson says the risk is worth it. Not only can he operate leaner, more cost
  effective businesses, but employees have an opportunity to rise above their
  job descriptions, and really jump into the entrepreneurial fun of running a
  business. Everyone counts.


  “…_the more you free your people to think for themselves, the more they can
  help you. You don’t have to do this all on your own.”_


  In _Business Stripped Bare_, Branson’s latest in a long string of books
  including _Losing My Virginity_ and _Screw It, Let’s Do It_, the rebel
  entrepreneur dives deep into the inner details of some of his most high
  profile ventures. Rich with anecdotes of taking on British Airways with the
  launch of Virgin Atlantic, challenging physics with Virgin Galactic and dozens
  of other examples, Branson shares what he believes to be the biggest lessons
  he’s learned through his varied and expansive experience.

  ### Blame Small


  > "Failure usually occurs when leaders avoid the reality of business. You have
  to trust the people around you to learn from their mistakes. Blame and
  recriminations are pointless."- Business Stripped Bare, page 170


  If you want your staff to “own” their roles – to passionately and
  enthusiastically strive to do more with it, and create a bigger impact – you
  need to be ok with them making mistakes. I’ve often said that there are two
  kinds of mistakes: those that come from carelessness or lack of attention
  (bad), and those that come from experimentation and taking risks with the best
  interest of the company in mind (good. No, **great.**)


  If something doesn’t go as planned, take a step back and look at the intention
  of the individual(s) involved. What were they _trying_ to do? Chances are, if
  you have the right people on board, they’re going to beat themselves up enough
  over the mistake; they don’t need your help in doing that. What they do need
  (likely) is a supportive word; someone to help them identify the learning in
  the experience, and brainstorm another way to accomplish that which they’d set
  out to do the first place. You don’t ever want them to lose that
  entrepreneurial spirit.


  Like its author, _Business Stripped Bare_ covers a wide range of topics and
  industries, but the flow through message is this: People are the root of every
  business and, ultimately, they’re what will make or break a company. Trust
  your people and embrace the entrepreneurial spirit, and perhaps you too can
  have even a taste of the life Sir Richard Branson has created for himself.

  ### Allow for Passion


  > "After all, we only live once, and most of our time is spent at work, so
  it's vital that we are allowed to feel good about what we do. Throwing
  yourself into a job you enjoy is one of life's greatest pleasures - but it's
  one that some leaders of industry seem determined to stamp out at all costs."-
  Business Stripped Bare, page 25


  Having a small team means relying more heavily on each individual on the team.
  Which means you need to trust that they’re going to show up on time, be
  engaged in their work, and truly strive to maximize the impact of the hours
  they put in. Some may look at this as a leap of faith, but you can hedge your
  bets by creating an environment, and set of responsibilities that really ties
  into each person’s sense of purpose, and sense of passion. So how do you
  understand their passions?


  Couple things – hire the right people, ask them what they want, watch and
  listen, and get out of their way. It’s as simple (but not necessarily as easy)
  as this.


  If you know what you stand for (Virgin is about making the experience fun for
  the customer), and share that purpose during your interviews, you’ll attract
  the right kind of people. Once they’re in, get a sense of what motivates them
  – what makes them tick -by asking questions, watching their behaviour, and
  listening to the feedback you get. Then, stay out of their way and let them
  **own** their role. Let them take full credit, and full responsibility.
  Ownership = pride, and pride = dedication.

If there’s one word that has **_never_** been associated with famed serial entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson, it’s **boring**. As owner and founder of the Virgin brand – which now spans 450 companies and dozens of industries, from music to space travel (and virtually everything in between) – Branson’s secret to success is passionately creating customer-centric businesses in industries he’s personally fascinated with.
