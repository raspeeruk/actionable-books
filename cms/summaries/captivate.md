  ### Show your vulnerability


  > "Having above average people skills is not about being perfect. It’s not
  about never making a social blunder again. Rather, people who have great
  interpersonal intelligence leverage their vulnerability."- Captivate, page 233


  You can leverage your vulnerability in interactions simply by diverting from
  expected scripts. Say how you really feel to see if you can start more
  meaningful conversations. By being open with others and sharing your
  uniqueness with them, you invite others to be open with you. And if you react
  to someone’s openness with curiosity, understanding, and appreciation, that’s
  when you build real connection.


  Being genuine and attentive is increasingly an asset as the working world
  becomes more human-centered. This is encouraging for those who pride
  themselves on these qualities, including many introverts. While much of the
  advice on people skills suggests you try to come across as more extroverted,
  Van Edwards shows that the most valuable connections come from when you reveal
  your true self.

  ### Ask people about their personality


  > "Knowing someone’s personality gives a tremendous boost to your persuasive
  powers."- Captivate, page 149


  Use introduction periods with new friends, new employees, and new colleagues
  as a chance to ask people directly about their personality traits. It gives a
  purpose to your conversational spark questions, which can lead to a positive
  rapport.


  Rate yourself first, then rate other people as high or low based on the Big
  Five:


  *   **Openness** – How they approach new ideas. Suggesting many projects at
  once might overwhelm someone with low openness.

  *   **Conscientiousness** – How they get things done. Long, detailed emails
  might intimidate someone who has low conscientiousness.

  *   **Extroversion** – Their approach to interacting with people. Someone with
  low extraversion may find working in a team overwhelming.

  *   **Agreeableness** – How they cooperate with others. Someone with high
  agreeableness may accept all suggested projects, but might not know where to
  start.

  *   **Neuroticism** – How stable their mood is. Frequent check-ins from a
  colleague may be frustrating to someone with medium to low neuroticism.


  When deciphering someone’s personality, also focus on their primary value. We
  all have a need that’s stronger than others during professional, social, and
  romantic interactions. My (and Van Edwards’) primary professional value is
  information. We’re always reading as much as we can and then looking to share
  what we learn. Knowing someone’s primary value is the key to pleasing them.


  *   **Love** – Needs to feel accepted, liked by others. Make them feel liked
  by including them.

  *   **Service** – Needs to feel supported and cared for. Do a favor for them.

  *   **Status** – Needs to be praised and respected by others. Give them
  credit.

  *   **Money** – Needs to feel financially secure. Give them bonuses.

  *   **Goods** – Needs to collect things. Make sure their workspace is
  comfortable.

  *   **Information** – Needs to be in the know and give advice. Keep them in
  the loop and ask for their opinion.


  Add to these characteristics to someone’s appreciation language and you have
  an even more complete picture of how to interact successfully with them. To
  figure out how someone likes to be appreciated, watch how they treat you and
  others. They may like hanging out in your office, hugging instead of shaking
  hands, or bringing back little gifts for you from their trips. You can also
  bring up questions in conversation like, “What’s the nicest thing someone has
  ever done for you?”, or more directly, “How do you celebrate your successes?”


  *   **Words of affirmation** – Express care through the written word. Write
  check-in emails.

  *   **Gifts** – Express care through small gifts. Thank you gifts, birthday
  gifts, etc.

  *   **Physical touch** – Express care through touch. Handshakes, arm pats,
  high fives.

  *   **Acts of service** – Express care by doing things for others. Help with
  task completion.

  *   **Quality time** – Express care by being in the presence of the other.
  Lunches or drinks, coming in early or staying late.


  Eventually, you may learn to speed-read new acquaintances. This involves
  watching for “microexpressions”, brief, involuntary facial expressions from
  immediate emotional reaction. For example, asking an introvert “Do you know
  anyone else here?” at an event may result in a flash of fear. Or you may
  notice flashes of frustration when delivering a highly detailed presentation
  to a client who has low conscientiousness.

  ### Let your uniqueness shine


  > "Unique questions, unexpected stories, and uncommon occurrences keep us
  alert in conversation… being different wakes people up."- Captivate, page 64


  Let your uniqueness shine through the words you use, the questions you ask,
  and the stories you tell. Since we get a dopamine spike from novel
  experiences, this will make you more memorable. The more unique details you
  communicate about yourself, the more chance you have of finding a meaningful
  common thread with someone. And the more common threads, the more you and the
  other person become attuned.


  Pick some favorite conversational sparks to move beyond small talk. A question
  like “What’s your story?” or asking for advice gets people talking about their
  values, hopes, and fascinations, and are more likely to reveal aspects that
  are important to both of you.


  Try to insert novelty wherever you can in your interactions with others:


  *   **Spice up your job title.** Even if just for networking, give yourself a
  fun title like “Professional People Watcher” (Van Edwards’ tagline).

  *   **Put an offbeat quotation in your email signature.** Make it one you’ve
  written, maybe a favorite tweet.

  *   **Serve people unique food and drinks.** Like lemonade and cake pops
  instead of the traditional coffee and donuts.

  The belief that it’s your responsibility to create engaging interactions and
  relationships is the first step in connecting more. When bogged down by the
  complexity of social situations, remember that you can control whether you’re
  captivating or not. Concentrate on celebrating yours and others’ unique
  personalities and watch as many of your relationships improve and deepen.

> "Learning people skills will change your life…you will have more confidence, control, and charisma in all of your interactions." _\- Captivate, page 4_

_Captivate_ is a collection of people skills you never learned in school. It outlines straightforward, but persuasive tricks you can adopt to solve people problems. Use these tricks to improve your career, your relationships, and even increase your income (people with great people skills make an average of $29,000 more per year). Coaches and managers will find the more advanced techniques especially helpful for reading and motivating clients and employees.

As an awkward kid growing up, author Vanessa Van Edwards started obsessively studying the science of human behavior to see if she could win friends. Now she leads projects like analyzing TED Talks for number of hand gestures in her research lab. They found that the more hand gestures you use, the more trust you build with others—Temple Grandin, Simon Sinek, and Jane McGonigal used over 600 gestures in only 18 minutes. _Captivate_ is sprinkled with fun facts like this and quirky anecdotes Van Edwards has collected through years of purposely practicing how to best engage others.
