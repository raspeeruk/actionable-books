  ### Experiment and get your hands dirty


  > "The bewildering variety at work in a healthy ecosystem is nothing but an
  exercise in sustained experimentation – try something new, and see what
  sticks"- Change by Design, page 61


  Innovation cannot begin without getting your hands dirty. Whether it’s
  company-wide, a department or your team that is looking to change and develop
  something new, an attitude to foster experimentation needs to happen. Despite
  not having defined steps that can be positioned within a company, Tim Brown
  does present guidelines to help encourage leaders to foster an environment to
  lead their teams towards the attitude of experimentation. These rules are:


  1.  The best ideas are created when the entire organization has room to
  experiment

  2.  The more exposed you are to technology, the more adaptable you are to
  respond and shift towards new opportunities

  3.  Just because an idea is said, doesn’t mean it’s the right one

  4.  An idea that generates buzz should take the lead

  5.  “Gardening” skills by management should be utilized to grow ideas

  6.  Purposes and outcomes should be properly articulated so that the involved
  organization has direction


  These rules can be applied to simple team-based problems that managers are
  looking to resolve immediately. Within a safe environment, taking advantage of
  everyone’s perspective and experiences can result in a team coming together –
  addressing and potentially opening up new opportunities that weren’t feasible.

  ### Be optimistic


  > "Try to be alert to the nodes where it all comes together, because that is
  where new ideas originate"- Change by Design, page 65


  Experimenting and shifting a team to embrace this new culture of “design
  thinking” can be daunting. Experimenting can have an effect that may take an
  unexpected turn; there’s always the potential that it might fail. However,
  Brown encourages failure to be a chance to layer on what worked, what didn’t
  and help steer the ideas towards something greater.


  Teams have to be optimistic and not fearful of the potential content that will
  be generated. If optimism isn’t present, it doesn’t encourage people to be
  open minded and comfortable to explore new ideas. Sometimes the best ideas are
  the ones that aren’t spoken out loud – how can there be a shift to present a
  solution, if the environment doesn’t encourage people to take risks, make
  mistakes and grow from them in a positive way?


  Leaders therefore should enforce optimism, encouraging the thoughts to not
  stop and use a failed experiment as an accomplishment instead of viewing it as
  a negative. Not only does this increase the productivity of generating new
  ideas but it also brings teams closer together, allowing them to feel
  comfortable adapting and shifting together.

  ### We’re all in this together

  Consumerism has shifted past being “passive buyers” and whether it’s the
  organization that provides the product or the buyer who purchases it, it is a
  cycle that must be nurtured so that organizations can innovate and provide
  tools that not will only satisfy the needs of a consumer but help them reach
  more potential. With this type of colonialism, it’s important to see both
  sides of the coin: what is your team trying to accomplish and what do the
  people affected by your actions need?


  Design thinking therefore is not a one-time solution; it’s more a shift in
  mindset so that when teams start to inspire, create and implement, it adds
  layers. As these layers get developed new problems, new opportunities and
  solutions can be added.

> "Design thinking taps into capacities we all have but that are overlooked by more conventional problem-solving practices" _\- Change by Design, page 4_

Whether it be a computer, pair of glasses or a brand new bicycle beach cruiser, there’s an element of design that is tailored. Tailored specifically to fit the functionalities of executing the right amount of technology, aesthetics and practicality that it can deliver. Consumers purchase products based on a series of want and need: what can solve their problems, what they are looking for on a satisfactory basis.

While most of the design technology is done through a specific team full of architects and engineers, author Tim Brown, the CEO and president of IDEO, an idea and consulting firm, has pioneered and tailored his company to provide and practice with his clients which he calls “Design Thinking”. This notion has resulted in challenging companies to consider Design Thinking to help with the development of innovating and solving more problems with the products that the company is looking to create.

Design Thinking, as Tim Brown outlines, is not a linear nor step-by-step process to take but merely ideas and starting points that are brought into few. Instead of following a series of “Step 1, Step 2, etc.”, Tim proposes this simple guideline:

*   **Inspiration** – problems or opportunities posed within a company
*   **Ideation** – crafting and tailoring ideas to test and practice
*   **Implementation** – taking the project into the marketspace

In conjunction with this approach, the type of people involved has another play. Not limiting one specific department to do all the heavy lifting, Brown emphasizes the importance of opening the floor to include colleagues from different departments who have different skillsets and experience. This approach provides a greater scope and a chance to holistically approach an idea to foster new concepts, opportunities and solutions.

While we may not have the luxury of hosting multi-department wide brainstorming sessions, we can utilize this “design thinking” within our own teams. Honouring the different opinions, skillsets and experiences every one of our colleagues can contribute, design thinking can help foster opportunities to fine tune and create new solutions on how to make an organization stronger.
