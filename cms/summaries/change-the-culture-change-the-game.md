  ### Attention to your Organizational Culture is Critical


  > "Optimizing the culture should command your attention every bit as much as
  your effort to achieve performance improvements in manufacturing, R&D, sales,
  and every other organizational discipline…Neglect it at your peril."- Change
  the Culture Change the Game, Kindle Edition, location 215


  This is absolutely key, and Connors and Smith take the reader through some
  real-life case studies which demonstrate the importance of organizational
  culture as it relates to performance. Their key focus is the Results Pyramid
  which incorporates Results, Actions, Beliefs, and Experiences, with Results in
  at the apex and Experiences at the base. This is a key model which the authors
  frequently return to as a foundation for more complex concepts and tools.
  Essentially this model (pyramid) highlights that the results a company
  delivers is a direct result of its culture. The process requires team leaders
  and the organization’s senior management teams to identify the results they
  want, and then break this down into what they need to do to create the right
  actions, beliefs and experiences.


  Effectively, the outputs and/or outcomes of an organization’s efforts reflect
  its culture, and if outputs need improving, Connors and Smith suggest that the
  first step requires changing the organization’s culture. What is refreshing
  about this book is that it sets out what individual managers/leaders must do
  to turn the culture around, and enable the organization to achieve the desired
  results. The authors also note that a shift in culture is not necessarily a
  once and once only activity, but that continuous efforts and adjustments may
  be needed to ensure the organization is successful in the long term. It was
  great to read the view that the current culture isn’t necessarily a bad or
  poor culture, it is simply not the culture to help the organization achieve
  its desired results.

  ### Confusion Equals Chaos


  > "Confusion licenses people to maintain the status quo and to dismiss their
  accountability to internalize the need for change. Confusion kills the
  momentum of any culture change effort because no one feels confident about
  which direction to move."- Change the Culture Change the Game, Kindle Edition,
  location 575


  This highlights the need for clear, concise, consistent, and constant
  communication about the results the organization needs to deliver. The authors
  note that 90% of management teams cannot identify with complete alignment the
  results their company wants to deliver. I can think of many organizations
  where the leaders state the results they want, but their actions and day to
  day decisions do not support these high-level goals. The result is confusion
  among middle managers. The authors provide several case studies where this has
  happened, with staff failing to deliver the appropriate results because they
  are uncertain of where to place their focus.


  The authors also note that it is important for managers to be clear about
  results, as this assists them in communicating objectives so that all
  employees share the same understanding.


  It’s important to note that clarifying objectives will help to identify
  whether cultural change is required. If the identified results will take more
  effort to achieve than past results, the organization probably requires
  significant shifts in some (if not all) aspects of the culture.

  ### Managers Make the Culture


  > "Whether managers realise it or not, they are creating experiences every day
  that help shape their organisational culture... these experiences foster
  beliefs about ‘how we do things around here’, and those beliefs, in turn drive
  the actions people take."- Change the Culture Change the Game, Kindle Edition,
  location 290


  The message here is that, an organization’s culture is influenced by its
  managers and leaders. A takeaway for me is that unsatisfactory cultures (in
  relation to the organizational outputs) are largely attributable to the
  organization’s managers. Connors and Smith provide this model and other
  actions to support managers in reviewing their practices to shift the culture
  to achieve the desired results. The authors also note that a key component in
  shifting culture is to encourage individuals to think and act differently. The
  leadership team must take the responsibility for creating the cultural change,
  and it must involve all leaders.


  I loved the Steps to Accountability: these identify above and below the line
  activities. Those above the line build on the previous one and involve best
  practices, they are:


  *   See it – obtain others’ perspectives, communicate openly and honestly,
  seek and provide feedback, hear the hard things that help outline reality.

  *   Own it – align with the organization’s mission and priorities, and adopt
  them as your own.

  *   Solve it – consistently ask ‘what else can I do?’ to help overcome
  obstacles and achieve progress.

  *   Do it – walk the talk, maintain a trusting environment, focus on top
  priorities and not blaming others.


  Below the line involves blaming others or taking the perspective of a victim.
  The authors note that this isn’t wrong as everyone occasionally benefits from
  sharing their frustrations about events or obstacles. They emphasize that if
  we get stuck below the line, we lose our opportunity to focus on what we can
  do to get past the obstacles and achieve the outcomes we want. Changing how
  people think helps obtain their commitment for the desired results, and can
  dramatically accelerate culture change. This doesn’t mean brainwashing them:
  it is still important that individuals understand the ‘why’ behind the changes
  It just means that managers need to change their own behavior to help shift
  employees beliefs: about them, the organization, and the results it wants to
  achieve.
f_conclusion: >-
  The best parts of the book for me were: Part 1, which worked through the
  pyramid in detail and provided lots of practical takeaways to implement in my
  workplace; and Part 2, which was very informative, and provided guidance for
  managers to integrate these practices at an individual level, including
  seeking feedback, storytelling, and recognition of good efforts towards
  achieving the change. It is definitely a must-read for managers interested in
  understanding how to improve their organization’s results and their own role
  in creating organizational culture.

> "When you build a Culture of Accountability, you create an organisation filled with people who can and will get game-changing results." _\- Change the Culture, Change the Game, Kindle Edition, location 176_

Roger Connors and Tom Smith, authors of [_The Oz Principle_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-oz-principle/), have written a book all about organizational culture and how to achieve successful culture change. To do this they emphasize the importance of accountability in achieving the desired changes, as a means to achieve a sustainable competitive advantage. I think they have made a sometimes complex and intangible topic quite simple and extremely results focused. I will be trying out some of their checklists and suggestions in the workplace in the very near future.
