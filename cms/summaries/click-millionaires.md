  ### Lifestyle Matters the Most


  > "The money is not the point. Your lifestyle as the owner is."- Click
  Millionaires, page 13


  All too often work becomes the epicenter of our lives. Whether you’re an
  entrepreneur or an employee of a company, work can become all consuming. But
  the danger in doing this is that you can lose perspective of the bigger
  picture that is your life. I’ve certainly experienced seasons like this in my
  own business – work becomes too intense, hobbies go by the wayside,
  friendships start to gather dust. It becomes a sad state of affairs. To combat
  this common problem, Fox suggests making your lifestyle the foundation of the
  business.


  Fox says that it’s important to prioritize lifestyle benefits over growth and
  profits. “Change your thinking to focus first on your goal of living better,
  however you define that personally”. He suggests reflecting on these three
  questions as a starting point:


  *   How do you want to spend your days?

  *   What do you most like to do?

  *   What kind of contribution do you want to make to the world?

  ### A New USP


  > "Instead of worrying about what you can sell, I’d like you to find your
  Unique Service and Purpose."- Click Millionaire, page 209


  Traditionally USP stands for “unique selling proposition”, whereby you
  differentiate your business and its offerings from the rest of the
  competition. Fox reframes this to encourage readers to think about USP as
  “unique service and purpose.”


  “How can you provide a service that others really need? What unique purpose
  are you here to serve? What it is about you that it’s time to maximize and
  share with the world?” These are great questions that Fox poses to readers to
  reflect on what makes their business truly unique and how they can leverage
  the uniqueness.


  This message particularly resonated with me as I’m constantly asking, “How can
  I be of service to our customers?” Anytime I create blog content, develop a
  new product or offer a new service, the brainstorm always begins with that
  question and usually leads to some interesting and valuable ideas.


  Fox is a seasoned online entrepreneur and the simple ideas that he shares lay
  out a great road map for anyone building an online business. But what really
  makes this book great is Fox’s desire for people to be their authentic selves
  in business and to build a business that truly reflects who they are.

  ### Find Your Audience, Not the Product


  > "Your first challenge is not to find or create the perfect product – it’s to
  collect attention."- Click Millionaire, page 190


  This was easily the most useful piece of advice around the brass tacks of
  building an online business in this book. At the end of the day you have to
  sell your products and in order to do that, there needs to be people who want
  to purchase them. It is far more profitable to focus on the people and the
  problems that they may have rather than a dream product that you want to
  create. Ultimately understanding that audience and having a clear picture of
  who they are will allow you to find and build a loyal audience in need, which
  translates into customers. When you focus on building this audience, you will
  not only be able to create better products but you’ll also bake viability into
  your business model.

> "The only person who cares about your personal fulfillment and financial independence is you." _\- Click Millionaires, page 10_

Creating an online business is something that more and more people are doing. The barrier to entry to opening your virtual doors is lower than ever, which means that more people can pursue their dreams and freedom through entrepreneurship. Scott Fox wrote _Click Millionaires_ as a case study and how-to for people interested in creating an online business.

_Click Millionaires_ could be considered one of hundreds of books that broach the subject of online business and entrepreneurship, but what’s interesting about Fox’s approach is that he really encourages people to use lifestyle design and their passions as the base of their business. Fox suggests that by focusing on these core principles, you are more likely to truly enjoy your work and your life. Furthermore, he reframes a couple of classic business ideas to offer a new perspective that is both insightful and innovate.
