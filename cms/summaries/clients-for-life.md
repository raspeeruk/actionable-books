  ### Change or Perish


  > "…expertise sold by professionals is becoming easily replicable, more widely
  available, and increasingly cheaper in our internet-speed, technology-driven
  economy."- Clients for Life, page 27


  It was my expectation when I started this book that I would learn more about
  what makes a great consultant, what clients expect, and how to get there, all
  of which _Clients for Life_ profiles in spades. Examining the 7 key areas that
  advisers excel is a worthwhile endeavor. What I didn’t expect was to
  experience a near panic attack when I read the above on a flight to Chicago!
  This book is about 12 years old and although time has shown that some of the
  “successes” may not have endured (AOL!), the flattening of the world and time
  passed has only confirmed Sheth and Sobel’s caution in this regard.


  I am not naive and I understand that if you are not innovating you die.
  Consultants are often focused on solving problems for others and sometimes do
  not pick their head up long enough to understand what the threats are to our
  own businesses. (Ironically, focusing on the big picture is a key
  differentiator between the “good” and the “great” in the professional services
  world.) **The threats to our professional services businesses are real,
  present, and need to be often considered.**

  ### On Your Honor


  > "In hindsight, bad judgments always seem particularly egregious and good
  judgments appear especially brilliant; but in fact the quality of judgment is
  extraordinarily difficult to evaluate."- Clients for Life, page 145


  **At my firm we say clients pay us for our judgment.** This requires one to
  evaluate a variety of incomplete facts, synthesize disparate information,
  consider culture, understand the personalities, and get it right! Clients will
  continue to pay us for great judgment. Sheth and Sobel give practical advice
  relative to the pitfalls that cause us to make bad judgments and provide a
  framework to make good ones. For me this means not falling into the trap of
  over simplification of an issue and to endeavor to dive deeper with clients
  instead of assuming that I know the answer. Overconfidence is one of the 5
  traps of bad judgment that the authors highlight. Others such as starting out
  on the wrong foot, confirming what you want to see, making new inappropriate
  commitments based on previous commitments, and believing it is us versus them
  might apply to you. To help sharpen your judgment, know what are your most
  likely traps and work to avoid them.

  ### Know More


  > "I once asked Sir Hugh Rigby, surgeon to King George V, ‘What makes a great
  surgeon?’ Sir Hugh responded. ‘There isn’t much to choose between surgeons in
  manual dexterity. What distinguishes the great surgeon is that he knows more
  than other surgeons.’ It’s the same with advertising agents. The good ones
  know more."- David Ogilvy, quoted in Clients for Life, page 87


  Experts are valued in knowledge-based businesses. However, Sheth and Sobel
  report that **the world’s best advisers know more.** They are not mere
  experts, but acquire broad knowledge and become “deep generalists”. This
  journey from expert to something more is a trip that is rarely taken. Experts
  are usually recognized as such, but how quickly things can change. What
  _Clients for Life_ shows us is that **the expert may be unaware that expertise
  is quickly commoditizing** (see my The Big Idea!) or worse – becoming
  irrelevant. **Building that broader knowledge base in order to engage clients
  across a spectrum of issues is an imperative that enduring consultants must
  develop.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Providing advice and counsel to those who need it is a worthwhile and
  rewarding career. To truly thrive one has to extend beyond expertise to
  creating long lasting relationships with clients. The ultimate arbiter of
  these relationships will be the client themselves. _Clients for Life_ is a
  solid roadmap for this journey.

Sometimes it seems that our world is full of consultants, advisers, and experts. In their early 2000 collaboration _Clients for Life_, Jagdish Sheth and Andrew Sobel take on what separates the consulting masses from those who are able to deliver value and drive their client relationships to the highest level. Those special consultants are not concerned about when their next engagement comes from; they have developed _Clients of Life._

Together the business school professor (Sheth) and the expert practitioner (Sobel) look at the world’s best lawyers, management consultants, recruiters, accountants, and political advisers to determine what separates these “all stars” from the pack. The duo does an effective job of drawing correlations from history’s iconic advisors such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Marshall, Drucker, and Kissinger and to amplify their conclusions on what makes today’s truly effective and in-demand advisors indispensable. _Clients for Life_ examines 7 key areas that great advisers excel including _independence, empathy, broad expertise, seeing the big picture, judgment, conviction_ and _integrity_. Packed with solid definitions and plenty of examples, each one of these areas is extensively discussed and helps the reader create actionable steps to improve in each.
