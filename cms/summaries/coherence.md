  ### Your A-Game is just a Breath Away


  > "... align and synchronize our physiology, emotions, feelings, thoughts,
  behaviour and relationships, \[and\] we will massively elevate our results and
  our performance without expending more effort, sweat or tears."- Coherence,
  page 33


  We have all become increasingly aware of the harm that silo thinking, working
  and managing can do to an organization. Many companies have embraced
  intermingling the way different groups work and think about problems to keep
  their companies at the forefront of innovation. But think about what great
  strides we could make as individuals if we stopped dividing our lives up into
  silos.


  What does the word coherence mean? According to Dictionary.com:


  1) The quality or state of cohering, especially a logical, orderly, and
  aesthetically consistent relationship of parts  

  2) The property of being coherent, as of waves.


  Dr. Watkins maintains that once we gain the ability to know ourselves at our
  deepest and most basic levels, biologically and physiologically, and can
  manage ourselves at each of these levels, we can become “Enlightened Leaders”
  of almost limitless potential.


  What is an Enlightened Leader? Enlightened leaders possess a long list of
  abilities and intelligences, which they are able to tap into, and use to serve
  themselves, other people and their corporations to greater benefit. A few of
  the intelligences important in these leaders are: physical management,
  emotional intelligence, emotional resilience, self-motivation, and social
  intelligence.


  How we act and react in and to the world, how we do business, how we view
  ourselves begins inside us. The world is volatile, uncertain, complex and
  often ambiguous (V.U.C.A., to use Dr. Watkins’ term), and **we can learn to
  perform our best at all times.**


  The consistency of performance is within our scope of control. The linchpin of
  our physiological control rests in having power over our breathing and heart
  rates. By learning to breathe properly, and to control our emotions, we can
  enter into any situation with a clear and logical mind.

  ### Learning to Listen is the Key to Relationships


  > "When we embrace the power of relationships and build cohesive
  high-performing teams or executive fellowship, we won't need to work so
  hard."- Coherence, page 317


  As more and more people make the mental shift from getting to being, doing and
  getting stuff done, the new target then is relationships and influence. For
  many individuals, especially in the business world, this will require learning
  and teaching new skills.


  The basic component of real relationships is trust. Trust, especially in a
  work environment, is created in an atmosphere of personal connection,
  understanding each other’s true motives, consistent delivery and work style.


  The first building block of trust is personal connection. This develops
  through communication. Communication implies a two-way conversation, a give
  and take of information, listening and responding. Listening is unfortunately
  something that precious few people are able to do. Most people remain quiet,
  giving the appearance of listening, not with the intention of receiving any
  information, but waiting to speak, to interject, to correct, to persuade.


  Here is another acronym that Dr. Watkins uses to help us improve our ability
  to listen: MAP


  **M**ove your attention away from your own thinking and drop into the body and
  BREATHE  

  **A**ppreciate the speaker  

  **P**lay back the underlying meaning

  ### A New Finish Line


  > "I believe the new finishing line is influence and the ability to foster
  powerful influential relationships inside and outside the workplace."-
  Coherence, page 243


  Most of us have discovered that the key to a happy, and possibly enlightened
  life is not in getting or having more stuff. It is about doing and being.


  Dr. Watkins tells us that each of the coherences, or areas of our existence,
  build upon each other in a stepwise fashion. What does that mean?
  Understanding and mastering our own physiology, by controlling breathing,
  heart rate, etc is called physiological coherence. The ability to properly
  control of our physiological coherence then opens the path to dealing with our
  emotional coherence. Emotional coherence aids our cognitive coherence,
  behavioral and relational coherence, and so on.


  Mastering each of these areas, and bending them to our desired outcomes, all
  through the way we breathe leads us to the limitless potential of the
  Enlightened Leader.


  Let us take a look at a few of these more closely.


  **Physiologic Coherence  

  **Physiologic coherence helps us manage our energy reserves. Breathing
  properly helps protect our energy stores and aids us in more rapid
  recuperation. This gets us back in the game sooner. Physiologic coherence then
  becomes a platform on which health and happiness are built.


  **Emotional coherence  

  **Emotional coherence is made possible by understanding and improving our
  emotional intelligence, self-awareness, self-regulation, internal motivation,
  empathy, our social skills, our emotional literacy and finally by good
  emotional self-management.


  Managing our emotional health, and the health of those we lead, is the path to
  alleviating a great deal of disease and distress in the workplace. We all know
  that our emotions can take a toll on our mental and physical health. But, we
  do not often encourage people to take an active part in their watching over
  their emotional well-being. We focus instead on things like diet and exercise.
  But it is our thinking that has the greater impact on health and fitness.


  Becoming masters of our emotions, is an important key to emotional resiliency,
  expanded awareness, and clear-headed thinking.


  One of the examples given by Dr. Watkins is in emergency situations. During a
  crisis, real or perceived, he says that we give ourselves a “_DIY lobotomy_.”
  During emergencies, our higher order thinking brain switches off, and we go
  running about fueled by random emotions and adrenaline. This is usually
  accompanied by rapid heart rate and shallow breathing.


  His contention is that the way to keep our brains turned “on” is to be
  consciously aware of what is happening and proactively manage our physiologic
  coherence. **We keep our brain turned on by stopping and breathing.**


  He calls it “SHIFT”-ing:


  **S**top everything, shift your attention  

  **H**eart, breath through this area of your chest to,  

  **I**nduce a positive (rather than negative) emotion  

  **F**eel it in your body; for at least 40 seconds  

  **T**urn your brain on; notice insights, write them down

Whether we do work that we love, or do not love, all of our lives run pretty much the same way. We press through the day to get to the end. We press through the weekdays to get to Friday; through weeks and months, to get to vacation, all for relaxation. And it is in these times of relaxation that we feel renewed, refreshed, ready to face the world with all engines firing and cylinders cranking. We feel unstoppable. **What if we could bring that sense of renewal to our everyday lives and to every situation?** This is the premise that fuels, Dr. Alan Watkins new book, _Coherence_.

By getting to know ourselves better, managing ourselves better, we have the opportunity to perform at our best. We can become Enlightened Leaders.

This new Enlightened Leader will reap the benefits of being able to perform well at all times, be healthier, happier, smarter, more successful and influential.

This enlightened form of leadership can serve to change individuals (leader and follower), organizations, the nature of business, and ultimately the world.

We live in extraordinary times, and we all strive to serve some purpose greater than ourselves. The only way to do that effectively and consistently is to change the way we think about ourselves, our relationships, and the ways in which we do business.

If relationship and influence are the new currency, then we are obliged to learn to use that currency to greater benefit.

Dr. Watkins offers easy steps, and many acronyms to help us remember the steps. **Enlightenment is only a breath away.**
