  ### Unleash and harness


  > "The unavoidable paradox at the heart of innovation is the need to unleash
  the talents of individuals and, in the end, to harness those talents in the
  form of a collective innovation that is useful to the organization."-
  Collective Genius, page 26


  _Paradox: a statement or proposition that seems self-contradictory or absurd
  but in reality expresses a possible truth._


  This is why leadership of innovation is so difficult. It requires thriving in
  the paradox of unleashing and harnessing. Absurd, but true.


  You need a place that unleashes ideas and options, a creative free-for-all
  where anything goes and everything is possible. But, you also need a place
  that produces a final solution—just one answer that solves a specific problem.


  This is the fundamental paradox at the core of leading innovation. Ultimately,
  innovation is the result of effective collaboration of diverse people. But
  collaboration requires give and take, discussion, and even heated contention.
  Based on their study, the authors identified six paradoxes related to the core
  unleash/harness paradox.


  ![unleash-harness](/assets/external/65d78b191f18f176f60a5232_unleah-harness.png)


  The implications of these paradoxes explain why innovation is inherently
  difficult. Managing and balancing each of these paradoxes in context and at
  the right time is the tough work of the leader and everyone involved. It’s not
  easy. But in their extensive research of innovative companies, the authors
  found these common themes consistently exhibited.


  I’ll admit, I’m more of an ‘unleash’ type of person, but I realize that the
  ‘harness’ is necessary to actually get things done. So my task is to do more
  harnessing in my life, but also realize its importance in my organization.

  ### Create the ability to innovate


  > "A decade of observing innovative organizations has convinced us that the
  best leaders of innovation don’t see themselves as people with all the answers
  who set a direction for others to follow."- Collective Genius, page 117


  Innovation requires certain organizational skills that can be encouraged by
  the leader. There are three capabilities that correspond to three key aspects
  of the innovation process: collaboration, discovery-based learning, and
  integrative decision making.


  *   **Creative abrasion** is the ability to create a marketplace of ideas and
  evolve them through discourse, debate, and even conflict. Collaboration
  doesn’t mean that everyone necessarily agrees, it just means that they work
  together to create the best possible outcome.

  *   **Creative agility** is the ability to test and refine ideas through quick
  experiments, reflection, and adjustment. It aligns with discovery-driven
  learning and emerges from consistent trial and error, often from efforts that
  don’t initially succeed.

  *   **Creative resolution** is the ability to make integrative decisions.
  Instead of settling by compromise, innovative organizations are able to
  integrate disparate and even opposing ideas into a single superior solution.
  It’s not easy, but the authors show how two teams at Google came up with a
  unique solution for storing massive amounts of data.


  I’ll be working on creating these abilities for myself. And letting them
  infiltrate more significant projects that I have at work.

  ### Create the willingness to innovate


  > "The wise leader knows that innovation is voluntary."- Collective Genius,
  page 70


  You can’t compel someone to care. But unless they do, you won’t have an
  innovative environment.


  How do you create caring creative employees? People need to be heard.


  When people feel heard, it’s like a breath of fresh air. And once they feel
  that freedom, they’re ready to offer their best ideas to solve whatever
  problems emerge. People united by a common purpose and willing to help each
  other is called a community. Rather than a place where “that’s not my job”,
  creating a community is one of the best strategies for developing a
  ‘willingness to innovate.’ It seems simple in concept, but is difficult to
  execute. It takes pulling down the silos and organizational structure that
  creates false barriers between people, and creating a unifying purpose that is
  greater than any individual’s goals.


  “Purpose – not the leader, authority, or power – is what creates and animates
  a community.” In order to work through the hard tasks of innovation, such as
  conflict and tension, or navigate through the other paradoxes, the community
  needs a strong purpose – the reason it exists, the ‘why’.


  I plan to articulate and frequently communicate a more meaningful purpose to
  those around me that I work with on various projects. I will also create a
  better sense of community by being helpful to others even when it’s not part
  of my job.

  "'When it comes to innovation, leadership matters, and it’s not leadership as
  commonly conceived today.' Every person in your group, whether that’s a small
  team or a large corporation, contains a slice of genius. Your task as leader
  is to create a place where all those slices can be elicited, combined, and
  converted into collective genius."

You can find a lot of books about innovation. And you can find even more books about leadership. But you won’t find many about what it takes to lead innovation, a task that may seem easy enough on the surface, but in reality, requires a completely different mindset and strategy.

_Collective Genius – The Art and Practice of Leading Innovation_ articulates these new requirements of a leader. It provides the insights, guidance, and real life examples you need to create an environment where innovation happens.

Using in-depth research, study, and interviews, the authors, Linda A. Hill, Greg Brandeau, Emily Truelove, and Kent Lineback, uncover what really happens in some of the most innovative companies. Each of the main points discussed by the authors is backed up by a case study in every chapter of the book (except one). Fascinating stories from Volkswagen, Pixar, Google, eBay and others will demonstrate how a leader’s role in innovation significantly differs from the traditional approach.
