  ### Recognize and Categorize


  > "The key to motivating people is to figure out what their WIIFM is. Once you
  know that, you can use that understanding to get them to do what needs to be
  done."- Confessions of a Reformed Control Freak, page 17


  We’ve all been told not to categorize people; that putting people in a box can
  be detrimental. Well, B.R. Smith tells us in _Confessions of a Reformed
  Control Freak_ that it can have its benefits when it comes to management.
  Smith uses the old acronym **WIIFM**, which stands for “What’s In It For Me?”
  to help with the categorization.


  Let’s face it, we all have different motivations for showing up to work each
  day. A job fulfills some need in all of us, or why else would we have one?
  While the common denominator is most certainly a pay cheque, motivation
  differs in an inestimable number of ways from there. Smith asks that you be
  vigilant in regards to the motivations of your team. It’s a good idea to sit
  down with each employee and ask them what they want out of their job, but it’s
  equally as important to be mindful and pay attention to their behaviour, which
  as we know speaks louder than words.


  The following two Insights will help you to both recognize and categorize the
  members of your team; to ensure productivity and understanding across your
  team. Because when you know more about your team, it’s easier to harness their
  strengths—and avoid their weaknesses.

  ### Achievers vs Sustainers


  > "It’s important for managers to find out who their Sustainers and Achievers
  are so that when it comes time to delegate additional responsibilities or
  spend valuable training dollars – they’ll know who to invest in."- Confessions
  of a Reformed Control Freak, page 59


  **Sustainers** are content with the responsibility they currently have
  (special projects are not their thing). They show up when they’re supposed to
  and leave when they’re supposed to, and rarely work overtime or on the
  weekends—unless, perhaps, they’ll be compensated with overtime. For
  sustainers, work is a job and not a career.


  On the other hand, **achievers** are upwardly mobile. They enjoy learning and
  are eager to add to their responsibilities, the catalyst of which is often a
  promotion. (It’s important to recognize that if you don’t give achievers more
  responsibility, they will become easily bored and will look for fulfillment
  elsewhere.) Their work is a career, not a mere job.


  It’s important to recognize that having both on your team is very important. I
  have been both a sustainer and an achiever at different points in my life.
  During high school and university, my retail job (working in a cash office)
  was just that: a job, a pay cheque. I arrived on time, was a supportive member
  of the team, completed my responsibilities well and in the time allotted, and
  went home. For me it was the perfect balance between my studies and a social
  life. It’s important to remember that sustainers are not lazy (they do their
  job well, of course), it’s just that their job is a smaller aspect of their
  lives than it is for achievers. But being able to distinguish your sustainers
  from your achievers—and delegating work accordingly—is crucial as a manager to
  ensuring the success of your organization.

  ### Employ the Disc Theory


  > "Each of the four styles has their own strengths; and there really isn’t one
  style that is better than any other. It is clear, however, that some styles
  are better suited for some roles, tasks, or careers."- Confessions of a
  Reformed Control Freak, page 52


  The DISC Theory isn’t anything new, but thinking about it from a management
  position is interesting because it allows you to have a greater understanding
  of behaviour, and the related team member’s performance. (All quotes below are
  from page 51.)


  **Dominant** “Direct and Decisive: These types of people make quick decisions
  when others cannot; they will confront tough issues or situations, accept
  change as a personal challenge, and will keep the team focused and on task.”
  i.e. ‘Your Type A’ personality.


  **Interpersonal/Interactive** “Optimistic and Outgoing: These people like to
  make themselves available to others; they spread their enthusiasm and positive
  attitude to others and will give positive feedback to their colleagues and
  teammates. They are great communicators and have an innate ability to build
  collaborative teams.”


  **Steadiness** “Sympathetic and Cooperative: These types are team players;
  they are sensitive to others’ needs, approach meeting agendas methodically,
  and are great listeners. They are very loyal, show up to work on time, and
  will maintain the status quo. They prefer to be non-confrontational.”


  **Conscientious** “Concerned and Correct: These types of people like things
  done ‘the right way’ as they see it. They are very thorough and will maintain
  standards; they emphasize accuracy and will try to use some diplomacy to get
  their way. C’s are your best planners.”


  Did you notice anything when reading the definitions of each of the four
  behaviours? Yes, they all outline the “pros” of each behaviour type. But as we
  all know, when there’s a pro there _has_ to be a con. The “cons” are outlined
  as follows:


  **Dominant**: Can appear to be unapproachable, insensitive, impatient


  **Interactive/Interpersonal**: Can be disorganized, appear to be superficial
  when dealing with others, avoids follow-through, has difficulty working alone


  **Steadiness**: indecisive (don’t want your decision to “make waves”),
  indirect, dislikes change (anxiety of failure)


  **Conscientious** – perfectionist, preference of working alone, creativity
  killer


  The DISC Theory is useful in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of
  your direct reports, or even your fellow team members if you aren’t in a
  management position. Use the theory to delegate work, and to anticipate the
  challenges that may lie ahead for specific people in specific roles. But don’t
  live and die by this theory. In the end we’re all unique individuals and our
  motives cannot be completely understood or foretold by any theory.
f_conclusion: >-
  B.R. Smith’s _Confessions of a Reformed Control Freak_ is an interesting book
  which combines thoughtful research with his own years of experience in
  management. It’s a book worth learning from – for those new to management and
  for veterans, alike. After all, there’s always something new to be learned, no
  matter where you find yourself in your career.

> "The real impediment to producing a higher quality product more efficiently aren’t the workers, union or nonunion, it’s management." _\- Kenneth Iverson, quoted in Confessions of a Reformed Control Freak, back cover_

B.R. Smith started in management many years ago, and his mantra was to “fake it until you make it”. Well, make it he did, and he’s here to share the tips he learned (often the hard way!) over the years in one volume, _Confessions of a Reformed Control Freak: The Top Ten Sins Most Managers Make & How to Avoid Them_.

As Smith points out in his introduction, there are now four generations working in the workforce, each with differing needs and expectations. This can prove challenging to a manager but, with the insight from this book on what to do (and what not to do!), we can reduce the anxiety some people feel in managing their team.
