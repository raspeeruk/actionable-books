  ### Bottom Line Benefits of ConnectAbility


  > "…there seems to be a movement…in which the status-loving, jet-setting,
  deal-making celebrities of the 1990’s are being replaced by
  awareness-sensitive leaders who are more performance oriented and less
  egocentric."- ConnectAbility, page 33


  For over a decade, studies at organizations that adopted an awareness culture
  noticed an impact on results through:


  *   Increased sales

  *   Less turnover

  *   Greater merit increases and job satisfaction

  *   More effective leadership and management skills

  *   Higher overall job success and team performance


  Overall there seems to be a shift in the corporate mind-set from
  status-oriented, hard-driven, personality-cult, top-down leadership to more
  relationship-oriented, collaborative, communication-based types. The
  hierarchy-based Status Factor with its domineering leaders is giving way to
  the hierarchy-independent Awareness Factor with consensus building and a
  priority for grassroots sensibility.


  Executive management mindsets and behaviors set the pace of whether it will be
  an awareness or status driven organization.


  In the absence of _ConnectAbility_, the only apparent release for such
  frustration may be for those higher on the organizational chart to lord it
  over those in the lower ranks, creating the delusion that power is the
  ultimate reward rather than real contribution to the common goal. Such an
  organization promotes status as the manifestation of power, stifling each
  level of the hierarchy in turn, from top to bottom. Contribution to the common
  goal becomes a low priority, since each individual is now busier protecting
  his or her turf than being meaningfully productive.


  **There are many benefits to focusing on contribution.** Most importantly it
  changes the way you see things and that in turn affects your choices and
  actions. During times of uncertainty, knowing the difference you are making
  helps you to sleep at night. Energy is invested in doing what is right for the
  business instead of pleasing certain leaders.

  ### Overcome Failure through Acceptance


  > "Accept when a situation or interaction has gone wrong and reframe it to
  discover the ‘silver lining.’ Instead of becoming overwhelmed by anxiety,
  permit yourself to experience the emotion in the moment by focusing on it and
  labeling it accurately, allowing yourself to return to a state of inner calm
  (or mindfulness). Only then will you regain your self-confidence, integrity,
  and ability to be more persuasive and generally effective with
  others–colleagues or customers–at work."- ConnectAbility, page 125


  Three ways of reframing bad outcomes are:


  1.  Finding the “silver lining”

  2.  Focusing on solving the problem

  3.  Appreciating the moment, with what it has to teach us—even when bad things
  happen move ahead, creatively garnering support from your helpful associates


  **Mindfulness, or the ability to stay calm in the light of extreme challenge,
  is one aspect of agility skills.** To use it you must focus intently on the
  present moment, particularly on the emotions you feel, but from a calm,
  detached perspective. We can control our emotions, but only if we learn to be
  highly aware of them and choose to adapt to changing circumstances quickly and
  decisively.


  This is a process that can be used as a self coaching technique. It is easy to
  incorporate the authors’ three steps into a written reflection to quickly
  restore your clear thinking and know with certainty what your appropriate
  course of action needs to be.

  ### Increasing Your Team's Sense of Fulfillment at Work


  > "\[Question:\] How does a boss encourage his or her team to overcome what
  initially seems like a paradox: assuring good output while at the same time
  maintaining personal meaning and satisfaction on everyone’s part? \[Answer:\]
  By staying aware of what’s under the surface: others’ feelings. Just as a
  ships’ use of radar avoids low-lying icebergs, your awareness can be used to
  pick out and avoid emotional turmoil."- ConnectAbility, page 76-77


  **We’ve all heard stories of the doctor with or without a bedside manner.**
  The authors’ point out that ConnectAbility is just as important in
  professional private practice as it is in corporate environments. Those
  medical doctors with ConnectAbility, for example, have much better
  relationships with their patients. Among medical specialists in the United
  States, the Awareness Factor benefits not only patients but doctors as well.


  According to one study, medical doctors who lack the Awareness Factor are much
  more likely to get sued for malpractice. To determine what the difference was
  between surgeons who were sued for malpractice at least twice by those who
  hadn’t been sued at all, Wendy Levinson and her colleagues conducted a study.
  They found a small but remarkable difference. Those who weren’t sued, it
  turned out, spent somewhat more time with their patients and, even more
  important, were much more likely to be experienced as empathetic and
  understanding. They engaged in active listening and were more likely to share
  something humorous.


  There was no indication of any difference between the two groups in terms of
  experience or skill in surgical practice, merely the difference in the skills
  of awareness-based listening.
f_conclusion: >-
  I believe the authors have drilled deeply into what employees and leaders need
  to put into practice in today’s rapidly evolving work environments. Their
  advice is relevant in a world where employees are becoming managers much
  earlier in their careers and executives find themselves having to unlearn
  outdated behaviors and mindsets.

  There is a new generation in the workplace – one more focused on process over
  endgame, on people over paycheck, on personal development over company
  loyalty. The values of what we might refer to as the 'status generation' have
  yielded to those of the ‘awareness generation.'

Drawing from the powerful lessons of emotional awareness and relationship dynamics, _ConnectAbility_ promotes a sophisticated yet simple method for developing superior partnerships guaranteed to create quality results on a consistent basis. Even the best intentioned team players too often focus more on communicating their own ideas than hearing and understanding what others have to say. _ConnectAbility_ changes all this using eight steps to foster optimum communication.

David Ryback Ph.D., along with Jim Cathcart and David Nour, share practical ways people and organizations are using to adapt to this workplace cultural shift.
