  ### Work is Love Made Visible


  > "The seven qualities that support an extraordinary business organization and
  an extraordinary life: unconditional responsibility, essential integrity,
  ontological humility, authentic communication, constructive negotiation,
  impeccable coordination and emotional mastery"- Conscious Business, page 296


  To develop these skills it is necessary to see work as love made visible.


  So we start with what matters most to us. We then commit to achieving a vision
  that exceeds any individual capacities and unites us with our fellow workers
  in a common effort with genuine meaning.


  Once this collective consciousness has been developed, it fosters peace and
  happiness in individuals, respect and solidarity in the community, and mission
  accomplishment in the organization.


  Developing a conscious culture is a business imperative. It enables the
  execution of the organization’s strategy, the achievement of its goals and the
  fulfilment of its mission.


  The only way to generate a competitive advantage and long term profitability
  is to attract, develop and retain talented employees.


  A team that is well managed, and thus well led, operates in alignment, because
  each of the team members takes the team goal as his own.

  ### How to Have ‘Difficult’ Conversations


  > "A ‘difficult conversation’ is difficult because we feel threatened in the
  three aspects of task, relationship and self’"- Conscious Business, page 137


  To maximize effectiveness, deepen relationships, and live authentically, you
  must ‘refine’ these toxic opinions and extract the truth at their core. Even
  the most unconscious and impulsive opinions contain very important
  information.


  Exchanging valid information is the first step in any cooperative effort. It
  is impossible to create a shared understanding of a situation without an
  honest disclosure of all sorts of information, from basic facts to opinions,
  feelings, interests and desires.


  We need to address everybody’s feelings with equanimity and compassion before
  getting to problem solving.


  The goal is to act in alignment with our essential values, focusing on
  integrity as the only way to experience true self-esteem. We need to stop all
  the ‘controller’ attempts to achieve self-worth through proving that we are
  right and the other is wrong.


  In a productive conversation, the goal is to let others know what impact their
  actions had on us and inquire as to what led them to act the way they did.
  Conversely, we need to inquire to learn what impact our actions had on them,
  and to reveal the reasoning behind them.


  The first step to processing toxic thoughts is awareness.


  The second step is assuming unconditional responsibility.


  As a player, you ask yourself, ‘How am I contributing to this ineffective
  conversation? How can I invite the other’s truth and offer mine in a
  respectful and honest way?’


  Your player voice also asks ‘What mistakes have I made? What mixed intentions
  have I enacted? How have I contributed to the problem?’


  The third step is to strive for mutual learning.


  Mutual purpose is the entry condition of dialogue. With a shared goal, you
  have both a good reason and a healthy climate for talking. Without mutual
  purpose, the conversation degenerates into an unproductive argument.


  In a difficult conversation:


  1.  Learn their story.

  2.  Express your views and feelings with clarity, honesty and respect.

  3.  Address the situation together. How can you satisfy both of your needs?
  Where your needs conflict, can you use equitable standards to ensure a fair
  and workable way to resolve the conflict?

  4.  Create a respectful context for the conversation. Respect is like air. If
  you take it away, it’s all people can think about. The conversation then
  degenerates into defending dignity.

  5.  Ensure you have a proper setting for the conversation. Is it the right
  environment? Is there enough time? Is everyone ready to have a frank
  discussion? Have potential distractions been eliminated?

  ### Integrity Comes Before Success


  > "If you want to live a good life, you must subordinate success to integrity,
  not vice versa"- Conscious Business, page 75


  Integrity encourages full commitment to the task at hand and to winning. Full
  focus is placed on the task. Integrity also provides a wider interpretation
  than just success.


  True success is not just accomplishing your goals, but feeling happy and at
  peace.


  We are encouraged to be ‘players’ rather than ‘victims’. The victim uses the
  language of ‘should’ indicating obligation and judgment. The player uses the
  language of ‘could’ indicating possibility and learning.


  You must take unconditional responsibility; you need to see yourself as a
  ‘player’, as a central character who has contributed to shape the current
  situation – and who can thus affect its future.


  Authentic communication is built upon productive expression and inquiry.


  Productive expression is a way to present your viewpoint to others as
  effectively as you can. You are not trying to convince anyone that you are
  right; you are helping others to understand why you think the way you do. Try
  this:


  1.  Describe the problem in a way that feels true for both sides.

  2.  Communicate the facts that support your reasoning. Provide concrete
  examples and illustrations.

  3.  Own your opinions; they are what you think not the objective truth. Take
  100% responsibility for your emotional experience.

  4.  Connect recommendations for action with your interests and concerns.

  5.  Ensure comprehension – invite responses and feedback.

  6.  Accept challenges – For example, you could say ‘I may be totally mistaken.
  It sounds to me like you have a different perspective’.

  In conclusion, Fred Kofman invites us to take these newly learnt skills and
  seek to serve rather than be served. As the Zen masters advise, ‘Before
  enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood and
  carry water.’

> "The main task of a conscious business is to help people succeed (accomplish their mission) while they develop healthy relationships (belong to a community) and experience an unconditional sense of peace, happiness, and growth (actualize and transcend the self)." _\- Conscious Business, page 293_

In _Conscious Business: How to Build Value Through Values_, Fred Kofman brings us to a new understanding of what it actually means to be ‘conscious’ in a business setting and how this can transform average or even failing businesses into outstanding businesses that have enormous competitive advantage.

This inside-out approach encompasses body, mind, spirit, culture and nature.

Mastery of self at an emotional, mental-ethical and spiritual level is where it all begins.

“I hope that with a higher level of consciousness we will enter the marketplace together to support the liberation of all sentient beings,” writes Kofman. “We might then realize then that our business organizations and our work are nothing other than an aspect of Plato’s visible sensible God.”
