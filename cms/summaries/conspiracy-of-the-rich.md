  ### The Third Education


  > "In today's world, you can be an academic genius but still be a financial
  imbecile."- Conspiracy of the Rich, page 13


  80% of all lottery winners are bankrupt within five years. Why is that?
  Kiyosaki believes that it has to do with the type of education we’re receiving
  (and not receiving) in our public education system. Today there are three
  crucial types of education:


  1.  **Academic education** – reading, writing and basic math

  2.  **Professional education** – the skills to work for money

  3.  **Financial education** – the skills to have money work for you


  Which of the three were you taught during your formal education? Here’s the
  real danger of our education system: we believe in it to a fault. So many of
  us are filled with the false belief that what we’re taught is valuable, and
  that most of what is omitted from the curriculum is not terribly important…
  otherwise, why wouldn’t they teach it to us in school?


  In _Conspiracy of the Rich_, Kiyosaki argues that the education system
  deliberately avoids teaching financial education because the system is
  designed by the wealthy to create skilled employees, not entrepreneurs or
  business owners. It’s a fascinating case he presents, and well worth the read.


  Whether you believe in the “conspiracy” or not, the fact is that while the
  traditional education system does a reasonably good job of teaching the first
  two types of education, it completely leaves off the third. Which leaves it up
  to us to educate ourselves.

  ### SELL is Not a Four Letter Word


  > "The secret to my success has been the word sell. In 1974, I went against my
  poor dad's values and became a student of the word sell. In the world of
  money, it is a very important word."- Conspiracy of the Rich, page 14


  The simple truth of the financial mess in which we now find ourselves is that
  North America has reached a point where it can no longer sell as much as it
  buys. The same can easily be true with your own life.


  What are you selling (i.e., what puts money in your pocket) and what are you
  buying (what takes money out of your pocket)? While many financial “experts”
  focus almost exclusively on reducing your “buying”, Kiyosaki suggests that
  life’s too short to live below your means. Not that he endorses reckless
  spending. Rather, he reminds us not to forget the importance of what we’re
  selling, and how we’re selling it.


  What do you offer to the world, and how are you selling it? Are there ways to
  leverage or maximize what you’re capable of contributing? Ways that aren’t
  currently being explored? Perhaps more importantly, is what you’re selling
  generating capital gains, or cashflow? In other words, are you trading hours
  for dollars, or are you trading knowledge for dollars?


  Understanding the difference between capital gains and cashflow could be the
  single greatest insight into the financial world that you can gain. And,
  thankfully, Kiyosaki has made it easy (and inexpensive) to learn the
  difference. This is a unique book and, as he says, “If I had taken this book
  through the traditional channels, the final copy wouldn’t even be worth
  reading.”

  ### Learn the Language


  > "Words are the most powerful tools created by humans."- Dr. Buckminster
  Fuller, as quoted in Conspiracy of the Rich, page 12


  I joined a football league this summer, just for fun. Even in a recreational,
  Sunday morning pickup league, I still needed to learn some of the jargon;
  slant, post, button hook and fly are all now part of my vocabulary. If I
  didn’t understand the basic language of the sport, I’d be totally ineffective
  in playing the game.


  I opted in to football; it was something I chose to be a part of. Money is not
  something we have a choice in. Whether we like it or not, “finance”,
  particularly our own, personal finances is a game we’re all playing.


  There’s a power to words. The power to empower, or the power to alienate and
  confuse. Kiyosaki would argue that there has been a conspiracy for years to
  keep the “non-elite” confused and in the dark about most of the financial
  world. Terms like bailout, ponzi scheme, inflation, recession, and depression
  are all over the news. We hear them so often, and yet how many among us can
  explain even one of those terms clearly? I mean really clearly. Do you know
  what a bailout is? Who gets the money? Why? Where does the money come from? Is
  a bailout a solution to the problem? What is the real problem?


  Learning the language of money is the first step to playing the game of
  wealth.


  Commit to reading one or two books on finance this year, and get yourself in
  the game. (For some starting points, you can try [**_Rich Dad, Poor
  Dad_**,](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/) or [**_The
  Automatic
  Millionaire_**.](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-automatic-millionaire/))

  Possibly one of the greatest insights into the current economic climate,
  _Conspiracy of the Rich_ is a must read for anyone interested in controlling
  their own financial future. It’s time to get the third type of education.

Fact: the vast majority of us have been trained to follow a very specific road map to our lives; go to school and get good grades so you can get a good job, buy a house, get married and have kids. Work hard at that good job so you can earn a promotion, buy a bigger house and send your kids to university so that they can get a good job, get married, have kids… and so on, as the cycle repeats itself. We do it almost on autopilot, going through the motions and pursuing that vague ideal of “happiness”. Has anyone ever bothered to stop and ask “WHY”? Who created this cycle, this rat race? And for what purpose?

Based on the belief that there is a class of “super-wealthy” who run our banking system, government structure, education platform and the Federal Reserve, Robert T. Kiyosaki has created _Conspiracy of the Rich_ as an eye opener; a pulling back of the curtain, with the belief that with a proper education on how the financial world works, we can take better control of our own financial destiny.
