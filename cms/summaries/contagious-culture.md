  ### Intentional Energetic Presence (IEP)


  > "The more leaders take care of themselves and are responsible for the energy
  they bring to the table, the easier it is for them to have the energy and
  stamina to show up powerfully and keep leading."- Contagious Culture, page 48


  This book centers around the idea that by being intentional about how we show
  up allows us to create a positive impact around us while, at the same time,
  feeling good and energized.


  If you’re like most of us, you’ve probably been led to believe that it’s your
  capabilities that create your most significant impact.


  But what if it’s not?


  What if a much larger part of your impact lies in your presence? It’s what the
  author calls Intentional Energetic Presence (IEP).


  Your IEP is about how you show up in the world and to others. It’s about being
  intentional with the energetic presence you project, and setting yourself up
  to show up well through intention, healthy positive energy, and solid
  presence.


  Having impact is about being intentional with the energy you put out into the
  world and the second is about setting yourself up well so that energy is
  helpful to others.


  The more intentional we are about the impact we want to create, the easier it
  is to have that impact. #Winning.


  So how do we do that? How do we show up every day, as leaders, and create
  positive impact? The author makes a powerful statement in that it’s not enough
  to just have great impact or take great care of your people; it’s essential
  that you take care of yourself as well so that you can sustain and optimize
  that leadership and care. You can’t effectively lead others if you’re not
  doing what you need to be doing to lead yourself.


  **Taking care of yourself is a foundational part of the IEP model—it allows
  for greater access to all aspects of strong leadership: personal energy,
  creativity, wisdom, and intuition.**


  Having IEP is choosing, with awareness, how you want to show up, what impact
  you want to have, how you want people to experience you, and what you want to
  create. **It’s about deciding—consciously—how you want to create space for
  yourself and honour your own needs so you have the strongest foundation to
  lead from.**


  What you need to know about your IEP:


  **How you show up matters –** Regardless of everything else, your presence and
  intention with people can undermine everything else.


  **You are the common denominator –** If you don’t like something, look at how
  you’re contributing to it. Of all the common denominators, you are the fastest
  path to creating contagious impact in the rest of your life.


  **External motivation is exhausting –** Check your motivation and be honest
  about it. Want impact and the “why” even more than you want money or the
  promotion—those things will follow as a result.


  **It’s a choice we make every day –** Showing up. Having positive presence.
  It’s the choice that makes the difference.

  ### The Leadership Trifecta


  > "There is a disconnect of purpose, presence and intention in our daily lives
  as business moves fast and demands for attention hit hard."- Contagious
  Culture, page 39


  With more of us seemingly willing to compromise our health and relationships
  and more of us burning out, the implications of not taking care of ourselves
  are detrimental.


  The challenge is often not just about taking better care of ourselves, but how
  we create the right balance of impact, self-care, and people-care. How do we
  get results, thrive personally, and grow our teams in intentional ways?


  It’s not easy. The author provides us with examples of the three main kinds of
  challenges we can face:


  1.  **Impact but no self-care.** This is one of the greatest challenges we
  have as leaders doing awesome stuff: To push the company, the team, the
  product—to rock it. _And_ balance it all with quality time with our spouses
  and kids and friends. Approaching our lives this way has a cost. And it can be
  done better. Through presence, intention, and choice**. It doesn’t have to be
  hard, but it does have to be intentional.**

  2.  **Self-care but no impact.** If you’re reading this, you’re not the kind
  of person who wants to show up each day taking great care of themselves but
  having little to no impact on those around you. This also has a cost. It
  requires the same solution as the first challenge does: Presence, intention,
  and choice.

  3.  **Impact through leaving dead bodies behind.** If you want to create
  sustainable, positive impact you’ve got to bring your people along with you.
  You can push them, pull them, inspire them, challenge them, call them out…but
  it has to be done with presence, care, and intention.


  **So how do we do it?**


  First, to handle everything you’re doing, you need to eat really well. You
  have to eat with intention. It becomes about making everything about quality
  over quantity.


  Second, you have to consider others. Period. You have to see your people for
  what they really are: human beings. When that happens, people will want to
  give you their best, daily.


  Third, try making agreements with your team to do what’s needed when it’s
  needed (e.g. stay late when you’re all working on a big project and to leave
  on time when you’re not).

  ### You are Contagious


  > "We pass our energy onto each other without even thinking about it."-
  Contagious Culture, page 22


  Whether you’re aware of it or not, you are contagious. Hopefully it’s in a
  good way, but, if we’re unaware and unintentional, it’s often not.


  Even if you’re not the leader, you’re not off the hook. Just because someone
  walks into a meeting with low energy doesn’t mean that we’re helpless and not
  responsible for what happens next. **We’re all responsible for how we let
  other people’s energy influence and impact us**.


  What Cavanaugh helps us to understand is that the more aware you are of your
  presence, and the stronger your energetic field, the easier it will be to
  decide intentionally who and what gets in and stays out. It’s totally your
  call.


  Your energy is contagious and it compounds – meaning your energetic field
  becomes stronger or weaker depending on how you nurture and hold your own
  space and IEP.


  All of this contributes to creating a positive culture.

  _Contagious Culture_ opens up a whole new world when it comes to creating
  strong, positive and intentional cultures. If you’re looking for a book to
  support the development of your culture, you won’t be disappointed.

I’ll admit, when I chose Anese Cavanaugh’s _Contagious Culture_ I thought was choosing a book that would help me learn how to contribute to creating a strong positive culture within my organization; a culture that was, like its name suggests, contagious.

Little did I realize I was picking up a book that was not only about how to create strong, intentional and impactful cultures in our workplace, our communities or our homes, but, perhaps more importantly, about how we must focus on ourselves in order to be the ones that show up each and every day to drive that culture.
