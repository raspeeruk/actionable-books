  ### Word of mouth is persuasive


  > "Contagious products and ideas are like forest fires. They can’t happen
  without hundreds, if not thousands, of regular Joes and Janes passing the
  product or message along."- Contagious, page 206


  Word of mouth is more effective than traditional advertising for two key
  reasons:


  1) **It is more trustworthy.** Ads are not credible. We expect them to tell us
  how great the product is. Our friends, however, will tell us straight what
  they think about a product and so they are more believable.


  2) **It is more targeted.** Companies create ads for a wide audience. Take an
  ad on the evening news for example. Only a portion of the viewers may need or
  be interested in the product. Word of mouth on the other hand is directed to
  an interested audience. I won’t share, for example, my enthusiasm about this
  book with everyone I meet. I will share it, however, with people who are
  either interested in growing their business or selling their product.

  ### Top of mind means tip of tongue


  > "Triggers and cues lead people to talk, choose and use."- Contagious, page
  92


  There are great examples of each of the six principles above. As an example,
  let’s look at triggers. We think about and remember things that we are
  triggered to remember. You may forget to sign your daughter up for tennis
  lessons until you see some kids playing tennis in the park. Triggers impact
  your thinking all day long. If they are not there then they’re out of sight,
  out of mind. When I first started taking Omega 3 supplements I constantly
  forgot them, until I connected it with my placemat. When I sat down for
  dinner, my placemat wasn’t complete until it had an Omega 3 pill on it. The
  placemat acted as a trigger.


  A study on this was done by Berger. His goal was to encourage students on
  campus to eat more fruits and vegetables. You might agree that most students
  know they should eat more fruits and vegetables and may even intend to eat
  more each day if reminded. But somehow, the fries and hamburgers make it onto
  the cafeteria tray instead. After measuring the baseline of actual consumption
  of fruits and vegetables, Berger exposed two groups to different slogans. The
  first group saw “Live the healthy way, eat five fruits and vegetables a day”.
  The second group saw “Each and every dining hall tray needs five fruits and
  vegetables a day.”


  The slogans were similar except for one aspect. The second referred to the
  dining hall tray. Interestingly, the students rated that slogan as “corny” and
  scored it less than half as attractive as the first one. In fact, when asked
  if they thought the slogans would impact their behaviour they were more likely
  to say ‘no’ to the dining hall tray slogan. The results however of the study
  were striking. Students exposed to the first slogan did not change their
  behaviour whereas students exposed to the second, “tray” slogan markedly
  changed their behavior. Why? The trays triggered them to remember the slogan
  and they ate 25 percent more fruits and vegetables as a result. The trigger
  worked.


  Berger suggests that products and ideas need “habitats” or places in which
  they live that have sets of triggers that cause people to think of them. **How
  do you create triggers for the behaviour or product you want them to
  remember?** For example, pairing Kit Kat and coffee in ads increased sales by
  a third! The ad made people think of Kit Kat when having their coffee.
  Remember Rebecca Black’s whiny song “Friday”? Were you as shocked as I was
  that such a poorly done song received such rapt attention? One of the factors
  may be that the title served as a trigger. When you analyze the search history
  for “Rebecca Black” on YouTube for March 2011, soon after it was released you
  will see a pattern of peaks on, you guessed it, every Friday! The trigger
  reminded people. **Triggers are powerful.**


  What triggers can you associate with the behaviour you are trying to
  influence?

  ### A checklist of 6 principals that drive things to catch on


  > "…certain characteristics make products more likely to be talked about and
  shared."- Contagious, page 207


  Berger says that any product, idea, or behaviour can be contagious. Just build
  in some of the following principles (which he calls the six key STEPPS) by
  asking yourself the accompanying questions:


  1\. **Social currency** – There are three ways to leverage social currency:


  1.  **Find inner remarkability**. **S**haring extraordinary, novel or
  entertaining stories which make it more fun for people to talk about and also
  make them look good.

  2.  **Leverage game mechanics**. The competition encourages social comparison.
  People care about hierarchy and will participate in things that help to show
  their status. Help them publicize their achievements to leverage this.

  3.  **Make people feel like insiders**. If something is difficult to obtain,
  people assume it must be worth the effort. People will value it more and tell
  others to capitalize on the social currency of knowing or having it.


  2\. **Triggers** – What cues make people think about your product or idea? How
  can you connect it with something so it comes to mind more often? For example
  in 1997 the candy company Mars noticed an unexpected increase in sales of its
  Mars bar. Why? The well-publicized mission of NASA’s Pathfinder was to Mars!
  It triggered people to think of the Mars bar! What triggers people to think of
  your idea or product?


  3\. **Emotion** – Focus on feelings. What is the emotion connected to your
  product or idea? Ask yourself “why” three times, each time digging deeper.


  4\. **Public** – Can people see when others are using your product? How can
  you make the private public?


  5\. **Practical Value** – Does talking about your product or idea help others?
  How can you highlight value and package it into something others will want to
  disseminate so they can help the other person?


  6\. **Stories** – Is your product or idea embedded in a narrative that people
  will want to share? Is the story valuable?
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s encouraging to know that any product or idea can be contagious. Like a
  forest fire however, that spreads from one tree to the next, contagious
  products or ideas can’t happen without hundreds or thousands of users or
  believers who pass the product or idea along. Why do they pass them along?
  Certain characteristics make products and ideas more likely to be spread.
  Berger’s six principles help us increase that likelihood. **How many can you
  include in your next product or idea you want to spread like wildfire?** If
  you have a product or idea that was contagious, why was that? What principle
  had you used?

> "This book provides cutting-edge science about how word of mouth and social transmission work. And how you can leverage them to make your products and ideas succeed." _\- Contagious, page 27_

Do you want to make your product catch on; be contagious? Do you need to cut through the clutter and help people see the uniqueness of your message, product or service or brand? **Wharton marketing professor Jonah Berger, author of _Contagious_, is said to know more about what makes information go ‘viral’ than anyone in the world.** He has spent the last decade answering questions like:

*   _What makes things popular?_
*   _Why do people talk about certain products and ideas more than others?_
*   _Why are some stories infectious?_
*   _What makes online content go viral?_

People often answer the question “what makes things popular” with the simple solution “advertising”. Berger turns that thinking around by illustrating that **people don’t listen to advertisements, they listen to their peers.**

Using the examples of viral videos and stories we all know (think of the Susan Boyle YouTube sensation or Jared’s story of his weight loss from eating Subway food) Berger helps us see the secrets behind the success. From his extensive analysis he reveals six principles that drive word-of-mouth and social transmission. Simply put, this book talks about what makes your product, idea, or behaviour talked about more.

### Word of mouth is persuasive

Word of mouth is more effective than traditional advertising for two key reasons:

1) **It is more trustworthy.** Ads are not credible. We expect them to tell us how great the product is. Our friends, however, will tell us straight what they think about a product and so they are more believable.

2) **It is more targeted.** Companies create ads for a wide audience. Take an ad on the evening news for example. Only a portion of the viewers may need or be interested in the product. Word of mouth on the other hand is directed to an interested audience. I won’t share, for example, my enthusiasm about this book with everyone I meet. I will share it, however, with people who are either interested in growing their business or selling their product.
