  ### Cast your net far and wide


  > "The more you can get the people in your audience to engage in your content
  in different ways, the more likely they will be to buy from you."- Content
  Inc., page 212


  While focusing on a specific niche, a business can repurpose a piece of useful
  content in many ways to reach out to a wider audience.


  For example, Jay Baer of ‘Convince and Convert’ publishes a three-minute video
  show called ‘Jay Today’ which is very well received. After each episode, the
  content is transcribed and edited, and posted to various channels, including
  YouTube, iTunes, his website, Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+ and others.


  Repurposing of content requires advanced planning and has the advantages of
  cutting production time and serving a wider range of audience.


  In order to diversify and grow a business, Joe Pulizzi observed that
  successful Content Inc. entrepreneurs use the ‘three and three model’ as an
  effective framework.


  There are two parts to the model:


  Personal:


  1.  A blog

  2.  A book

  3.  Speaking


  Business:


  1.  Digital

  2.  Print

  3.  In-Person


  Joe Pulizzi walks the talk. He blogs at the Content Marketing Institute
  website and has written a number of books, including this one. The blog and
  books positioned him as a thought leader and he was invited to speak at
  events.


  As a business, CMI is active in major digital channels like podcasts, YouTube,
  Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google+ and Slideshare. CMI’s print magazine
  ‘Chief Content Officer (CCO)’ has a readership of 20,000 marketers as of
  September 2015. The print and blog content are fully integrated and this is
  critical to the overall strategy. CMI runs several major events like Content
  Marketing World every year where it can meet its audience in person.

  ### Be Patient

  revenue model for your Content Inc. business."- Content Inc., page 279


  As with all ventures, there are road blocks on the path to success. Joe
  Pulizzi listed the six principles of good content for anyone planning to
  embark on the Content Inc. journey:


  *   Fill a need

  *   Be consistent

  *   Be human

  *   Have a point of view

  *   Avoid ‘sales speak’

  *   Be best of breed


  Beyond content, there are considerations of appropriate calls to action,
  distribution channels, teams, processes, and quality control.


  What does the journey of successful Content Inc. models look like?


  **Case study 1: Digital Photography School**


  Darren Rowse’s initial blog was a camera review site. He found that his
  readers would visit his site to research a certain camera and then disappear
  and never come back. Darren felt the dissatisfaction that he was not building
  a community. He then changed his ‘content tilt’ to one that teaches
  photography skills to beginners. He stayed with this focus for two years till
  his audience began to grow into the next level of content. Digital Photography
  School now has over a million subscribers.


  **Case Study 2: Content Marketing Institute**


  In Joe’s own words, “I launched the business in April 2007. It wasn’t until
  the end of 2010 that I felt we were on to something. The next three years we
  made the Inc. 500 list of the fastest growing private companies in the United
  States. Today we have a $10 million business.”


  However, being patient does not mean postponing revenue generating
  opportunities. After all, the bills need to be paid.


  CMI generated revenue through the benefactor (exclusive sponsorship) model.
  Digital Photography School did it through affiliate sales. Other methods
  include YouTube advertising and consulting.

  Marcus Sheridan of River Pools & Spas found that: “The ultimate content
  strategy is listening.”

  majority of the world believes he is the expert.


  Marcus listened to customers, to employees, to podcasts, to learn as much as
  he could. Then he brainstormed for content ideas that his audience wished to
  know about. Marcus believed there should be at least 50 questions. Answering
  these questions provided immediate and relevant help to homeowners planning to
  purchase a pool.

Joe Pulizzi provides a refreshingly encouraging model of how anyone can use content marketing strategies to build a loyal audience and gain the best understanding of what products ultimately make the most sense to sell. This is the least risky business launch model, and would not have been possible 25 years ago.

“Before 1990,” Pulizzi explains, “large media companies had the most power because they controlled the information channels … they controlled the audience. Now the power has almost completely shifted to the consumer. Anyone, anywhere, can be a publisher and build an audience.”

The window of opportunity is wide open because of several key developments:

*   Internet and mobile technologies have allowed anyone to publish and receive content.
*   As online publishing becomes mainstream, more content providers are willing and able to create content. People are more open to receiving any content that will help them live better lives, get better jobs or accomplish particular tasks.
*   Social media and Google help in the sharing and searching of useful content.

Content Inc. is a comprehensive, proven model based on Joe Pulizzi’s research.

“In our experience working with hundreds of businesses, and the dozens of interviews associated with this book, we’ve found that there are six distinct steps to the Content Inc. model.” They are:

1.  **The Sweet Spot** – the intersection of your knowledge or skill area and your passion.
2.  **Content Tilt** – telling the story from a different point of view.
3.  **Building the Base** – where the rubber meets the road. Select the platform, work on content creation and repurposing, plan the publishing calendar, organise staff and collaboration partners.
4.  **Harvesting the Audience** – get found and be connected with an audience to build a subscriber list.
5.  **Diversification** – expand for growth.
6.  **Monetization** – revenue models.

Filled with case studies, tools and strategies, _Content Inc._ provides a blueprint for businesses to follow.

It works best when one has a passion for the topic, as it becomes more enjoyable to research and create the content.

You probably have some special knowledge that people would be keen to acquire. What is the special tilt that no one else is addressing which will set you apart?
