  ### Conversations are not linear and we fill in the gaps ourselves


  > "The things we say, the things we hear, the things we mean and the way we
  feel after we say it may all be separate, emerging at different times... When
  what we say, what we hear, and what we mean are not in agreement, we retreat
  into our heads and make up stories that help us reconcile the discrepancies."-
  Conversational Intelligence, page 6


  Trust is a key factor for helping people connect with each other through
  conversation. Each of us has neurochemical reactions to others: we can feed
  off another person’s energy and they feed off ours. This means that we often
  make snap decisions and assessments about the person we are talking with and
  involves identifying whether we think we can trust them. Our assumptions about
  the other person can be influenced by our old memories about the individual,
  ideas, beliefs or other things we make up, while trying to identify whether we
  can connect with each other and create shared additional value and benefit
  from the conversation. This can happen within 0.07 seconds, and this decision
  can heavily influence the nature of the conversation. If we trust the person
  we feel safe and so able to share our views more candidly. Where distrust is
  involved, we can shut down and operate based on our assumptions.


  At the heart of Glaser’s book is the ‘Conversational Dashboard:’ identifying
  three levels of conversation with level 3 being the optimum for creating a
  trusting environment:


  Level 1: Transactional – people are exchanging information, updates and facts
  that help us confirm if we are on the same page. There is not a lot of trust
  and people are focused on what they need to get from each other to confirm and
  validate their own perspectives.


  Level 2: Positional – here individuals are advocating for what they want and
  are seeking to ascertain whether they can influence the other individual to
  share their perspective. Trust is conditional which can raise the levels of
  uncertainty thus triggering the fear neurochemical networks.


  Level 3: Transformational – individuals conversing at this level seek to share
  their views and learn more about the perspectives of the others they are
  talking to; this leads to individuals working together to co-create and
  achieve greater shared success.

  ### Lack of trust can be the undoing of successfully managing change


  > "Change brings with it uncertainty, and uncertainty triggers fear. As
  leaders learn to reduce fear and increase trust within their organizations,
  they lay the foundation for higher level conversations, where opportunities
  for greater innovation, collaboration, and success are revealed."-
  Conversational Intelligence, page 154


  Change is a constant and vital for organizations seeking to maintain their
  sustainability now and into the future. It makes sense that successful leaders
  are those who can bring their people with them and who can encourage their
  people to help them create the brave new world that might be required.
  Encouraging your organization’s leaders to lead with level III conversations
  is Glaser’s answer for how you can achieve successful and effective leadership
  in times of change. Too often, leaders take a telling and selling approach
  rather than working with their teams to co-create the future. Without trust,
  teams become fractured, and leaders have to work much harder for buy-in an
  alignment. When trust has been established, teams are unified and working
  together, and are much better equipped to handle change.

  ### You can be the architect of conversations for success


  > "Conversations are ‘rituals’ we embed into our culture and our
  relationships, and which give us a way to successfully structure our
  engagements with others… each ritual has a place and each enhances or impedes
  communication and engagement… Conversational rituals are what we do when we
  talk."- Conversational Intelligence, page 61


  Glaser identifies that our conversations can be structured in ways that
  support the development of shared trust and enabling success and introduces
  the concept of changing existing rituals for new ones that can facilitate
  better conversations. These conversations are ones where individuals respect
  and care about the other person’s perspective to lead to co-creating
  conversations where ‘_both people are transforming each other’s thoughts,
  ideas and belief systems_’ (63). Individuals are creating a shared sense of
  reality rather than trying to persuade the other person to see and agree with
  their point of view.


  Alternatively, ineffective conversations occur when individuals are intent on
  getting their message across, and talk past the other person—resulting in
  shared monologues as opposed to dialogue. Glaser highlights that this can
  occur due to conversational blind spots that individuals may have which means
  they are seeing the situation from their own individual perspective rather
  than seeking to understand the other person’s point of view. Five examples
  are:


  1.  Assuming others see, feel and think about the situation exactly as we do,
  preventing us from trying to understand it from their perspective.

  2.  Failing to realize that fear, trust and distrust changes how we see and
  interpret reality.

  3.  Being unable to see something from someone else’s point of view if we are
  fearful or upset about a situation.

  4.  Assuming we remember what others say, we actually remember what we think
  about what others say.

  5.  Assuming that meaning resides in the speaker, when it resides in the
  listener.
f_conclusion: >-
  Glasers’s book provides the framework for creating trust in conversations,
  along with the scientific evidence which supports the need for level III
  conversations. This book is a must read for anyone seeking to create a
  positive and productive environment, both at work and at home.

> “To get to the next level of greatness depends on the quality of our culture, which depends on the quality of our relationships, which depends on the quality of our conversations. Everything happens through conversations!” _\- Conversational Intelligence, page xv_

In _Conversational Intelligence_, Judith Glaser has written an impressive book which identifies the power of conversation in creating positive organizational climates. What makes this book so impressive is the provision of unequivocal science to support the importance of having productive conversations in the workplace. Judith has structured the book to take the reader from understanding why conversational intelligence is required to build an environment of trust, through learning how we can bring the right conversations to life, and concludes by identifying how to maintain this new level of conversation amongst teams. The amount of information and Judith’s pragmatic and practical ideas on how to implement constructive processes to support the right type of conversation is incredible.
