  ### The Culprit versus the Courageous Warrior


  > "We need the backbone of a warrior if we are to be willing to go
  face-to-face with that which has made us feel weak, impotent and unable to
  change."- COURAGE: Igniting Self-Confidence, page 4


  As Ford remarks, fear can be highly persuasive, arriving as it often does
  disguised via the Voice of Uncertainty. Over time, we become filled with
  worry, doubt and even dread. And, if we don’t take up the battle to conquer
  these culprits, they only get louder with every year.


  When we avoid, deny or attempt to muscle through, we unwittingly fall into the
  trap, “What you resist persists.” Instead, we need to befriend our fears and
  use them as fuel to propel us into a world of courage plus confidence. As an
  ally, fear urges us to move forward precisely in those areas of life where we
  feel most unfulfilled or emotionally challenged.


  For Ford, the greatest act of courage is to be and own all of who you are –
  without apology, excuses or masks. She invites us to think about how audacious
  it is to really believe in ourselves. To reach this potent place, we’re
  offered seven Codes of the Courageous Warrior:


  1.  Divine Confidence

  2.  Surrender

  3.  Emotional Freedom

  4.  Heartfelt Compassion

  5.  Loving Heart

  6.  Inspired Vision

  7.  Supreme Beauty

  ### Courage Activators & Confidence Boosters


  > "The way to allow that warrior to have a voice is to become unrecognizable
  to yourself, to move outside your comfort zone…to release that self-image
  you’ve kept trying to live up to over and over again."- COURAGE: Igniting
  Self-Confidence, pages 195-196


  In light of the subtitle, each of Code’s exercises conclude with a Courage
  Activator, Confidence Builder and Courage/Confidence Bonus. What follows are
  selected supplementary reflections to further embrace our greatness:


  *   Make a list of seven times in your life when you’ve been courageous.

  *   Make a list of five risks you have taken. Let yourself feel proud of your
  courage and confidence.

  *   Make a list of seven situations in which you told the truth even though
  you didn’t want to.

  *   List five times in your life when you admitted you were wrong.

  *   Find three people you need to make amends with. With a heart-opening call
  or email, say you’re sorry and offer them your love.

  *   Make a list of why the world needs you as a courageous warrior plus how
  you will use your strength and power in the future. Share your list with five
  people you feel safe and comfortable with.

  ### The Code of Inspired Vision


  > "You must allow yourself to be intuitively pulled toward something other
  than what you know right now or what you can see."- COURAGE: Igniting
  Self-Confidence, page 166


  Each Code is rich unto itself and worthy of careful contemplation if we are to
  move from the head into the heart. Though this Code falls later in the book,
  it’s vital for awakening from the trance induced by repetitively thinking
  about old hurts and regrets. Here are some extracted ideas to ignite visionary
  self-confidence:


  *   **Calling on the power of your imagination**. Allow yourself to see a
  vision of your future in which you’re passionately living your purpose.

  *   **Acknowledging your fear.** Make a list of your fears about living your
  vision. Give voice to the fear but then send love to that scared part of
  yourself.

  *   **Your resources.** Make a list of the actions you would take, the people
  you would surround yourself with, and the resources you would need to move
  forward with your vision.

  *   **Being in the presence of your vision.** Put in place a simple practice
  or activity that keeps you in the presence of your vision every day.
f_conclusion: >-
  When we do the work called forth by _COURAGE: Igniting Self-Confidence_, we
  leave behind the voices of hopelessness, helplessness, insecurity and
  powerlessness. By contrast, we heed the voices of Acceptance, Power,
  Confidence, Courage and Strength. It’s up to each of us which set we choose to
  listen to.

> "Fear knocked at the door, love answered and no one was there." _\- COURAGE: Igniting Self-Confidence, page xviii_

When author/coach Debbie Ford passed away at an untimely 57 following a long battle with cancer, the world lost a true great. In her Commemorative Note, Cheryl Richardson acknowledges how confrontational, emotionally cathartic and fearless Debbie’s work is. Wayne Dyer recognizes how significantly her legacy continues to heal the world. As each of us reads, we will notice how intensely personal yet widely-practical is her best-selling book, _COURAGE: Igniting Self-Confidence_. Indeed, this powerful volume offers multiple processes for overcoming insecurity plus fear, thus unlocking the courage within.
