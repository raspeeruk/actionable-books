  ### Better technology = more work


  > "Labor-saving devices thus create more labor. By shortening the time and
  energy it takes to do any one thing, these devices free up time and energy to
  do more things."- CrazyBusy, page 61


  Let’s start by looking at the situation. We have tools and technology that
  make it faster and easier to do things. So we do more things! Have you joined
  Facebook? If so you’re probably now staying in touch with more people. But are
  these relationships truly satisfying?


  Written communication used to be sent by mail. A letter would take a week.
  Now, if you don’t reply to an email right away, you might get another email
  asking “Did you get my email?”


  We receive messages on LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, email, voicemail and text.
  When a question comes up in conversation and we don’t know the answer, we’ll
  whip out our iPhones and Google it. If we’re bored for a moment, we’ll grab a
  tablet and start reading, surfing, or playing.


  This technology allows us to get more work done. According to research by
  Juliet Schor published in 1991, **the average American was working an
  additional 160 hours per year than in 1960**. That’s an extra _month_ of
  forty-hour work weeks.


  What’s the impact of all this connectedness and busyness? One impact is
  “culturally induced ADD”. Could you be suffering from this? Symptoms of true
  ADD include:


  *   Tendency always to feel in a rush; impatient

  *   Tendency to have many projects going at once, trouble with follow-through

  *   Tendency to want to cut to the chase or get to the bottom line immediately

  *   Trouble getting organized

  *   A feeling of being overwhelmed by daily life


  **If you relate to any or all of these symptoms, it doesn’t mean you have
  ADD.** You may simply be CrazyBusy.


  Stop and think for a moment about the impact being too busy has on you and
  those around you. For you personally, you may feel stressed and tired. For
  your family, there’s less time together enjoying true human connection. For
  your community, there’s less focus on contribution because everyone is too
  busy with their individual lives and problems.


  Being too busy saps energy, stifles creativity, and creates alienation.


  **So, why do we keep so busy?**


  *   We overcommit

  *   Being busy is a status symbol

  *   We can avoid everything that is difficult that we don’t want to do

  *   Everyone else is busy

  *   We are afraid that we will not keep up our standard of living unless we
  are SuperBusy


  Recognizing the impact and comparing that to the reasons for keeping busy,
  something doesn’t add up. It doesn’t seem worthwhile to be distracted and
  pulled away from what matters most, just because being busy is easy or looks
  normal.

  ### So long, (screen) suckers!


  > "A modern addiction, screen-sucking is like smoking cigarettes: Once you’re
  hooked, it is extremely hard to quit."- CrazyBusy, page 164


  What is screen-sucking? Screen-sucking is a word Hallowell invented to
  describe wasting time engaging with any screen, including computer,
  television, computer game, iPhone. This idea is also hilariously described in
  this article by the [Onion: Report: 90% Of Waking Hours Spent Staring At
  Glowing
  Rectangles](http://www.theonion.com/articles/report-90-of-waking-hours-spent-staring-at-glowing,2747/).


  Do we really need a new word for this? Surely many of us can relate to the
  phenomenon without a specific name.


  However, once the word “screensucking” was in my head, I started to notice how
  often I was doing it. In my office, I’m often sitting looking at my screen,
  even during lunch when I’m not working. On the streetcar, I’ll alleviate
  boredom by playing Angry Birds. In the living room, I’m often checking my
  smartphone for new messages, whether or not I’m expecting important
  communication.


  Of course, the first part of solving the problem is realizing there is a
  problem. **Why is it a problem to waste time on screens?** Personally, I’ve
  noticed that when I have time away from screens, some of my best thinking and
  most creative ideas happen. To create that space, I need more breaks from
  screens.


  A few ideas to break the screen habit:


  *   Move the screen to another room

  *   Put a timer next to the screen – set a time at which you’ll stop using the
  screen

  *   If most of your work happens on a screen, make a habit of taking “screen
  breaks”.

  ### Decide what matters most


  > "In the rush of today’s world, you need a plan to make sure you stay
  genuinely connected with living humans you know and like."- CrazyBusy, page 39


  First, we must decide what’s most important to us. Next, we have to schedule
  it. Only then will the important activity take place, such as time with our
  children, spouse, or best friend.


  Many couples have recognized the benefit of having a “date night”. If we
  assume time with our significant other will “just happen” in between all of
  the other activities we’ve committed to, we may miss out. This can result in
  feelings of disconnection and ultimately, dissatisfaction in the relationship.


  Scheduling time with loved ones is an example of the solution that Hallowell
  proposes. Key tips to managing your busy life include:


  1\. Figure out what matters most to you.  

  2\. Create a system to manage your time. Organize just enough and make the
  system based on your own preferences.  

  3\. Deliberately pay attention to how you invest your time.  

  4\. Identify and control sources of distraction.  

  5\. Delegate what you’re bad at.  

  6\. Slow down, stop and think.  

  7\. Play.

  _CrazyBusy_ will help you to identify if being busy is getting in the way of
  doing what matters most to you. You’ll discover areas where you allow yourself
  to get distracted or overloaded. Realizing the impact that this has on you may
  be all you need to make important changes in your life. And, if you need ideas
  about how to get it all under control, _CrazyBusy_ provides that too.

  "Being too busy, which can seem necessary and unavoidable, can become a habit
  so entrenched that it leads you to postpone or cut short what really matters
  to you, making you a slave to a lifestyle you don’t like but can’t escape."

Consider a typical greeting. It used to go something like this: “How are you?” “Fine.” Now it is often “How are you?” “Busy” or “CrazyBusy”.

Edward M. Hallowell, M.D., treats people with Attention Deficit Disorders (ADD). In the 1990s he noticed an increase in the number of people wondering if they had ADD. Most didn’t. However, Hallowell believes that the speed, technology, and activity of modern life has created culturally induced ADD.

_CrazyBusy_ describes the situation and impact in detail. It also offers solutions and tools to managing your life.

**What if you love being busy?** Hallowell acknowledges that **if you’re busy doing what you love or doing what matters most to you, being busy is bliss.** _CrazyBusy_ will resonate most with those who relate to the subtitle: Overstretched, overbooked, and about to snap!
