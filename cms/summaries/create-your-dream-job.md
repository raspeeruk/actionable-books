  ### Be Interested, Not Interesting


  > "Job searching today is an understandably scary prospect. With all the news
  about the number of people who either are out of work, have stopped looking
  for work, or have resorted to part-time work, and the caution companies are
  showing in adding new positions, it would be easy to assume that sticking with
  an unfulfilling job is better than risking a search for a new one. Making that
  assumption would be your first mistake!"- Create Your Dream Job, page 3


  Katz identifies the 10 Most Common Job Search Mistakes, and provides tactics
  for how to avoid them. The 10 mistakes are:


  1.  Sending out resumes only in response to job postings

  2.  Not believing that it’s possible to get a new job

  3.  Not clearly defining the work that you want to do and are best suited to
  do

  4.  Being afraid to ask for referrals

  5.  Avoiding conversations with people because you are embarrassed to be out
  of work

  6.  Spending too much time on the wrong activities

  7.  Talking to much when you have a networking one-to-one conversation or are
  meeting with a prospective employer

  8.  Having difficulty asking questions or knowing what questions to ask

  9.  Not using every conversation as an opportunity to expand your network

  10.  Lacking confidence or feeling hopeless


  Any one of these behaviors on their own may not be detrimental to your job
  search, but all together they may be fatal.


  The underlying theme of these mistakes is a tendency to try to be
  _interesting_, instead of _interested_. Of course you want to put your best
  self forward in your job search—you want to send perfectly tailored resumes
  and demonstrate that you’re the best candidate for the job. Maybe you’re
  nervous about tapping or expanding your network because it feels pushy, or you
  don’t want to ask questions because you’re afraid you will appear to be
  unqualified.


  To avoid these mistakes, focus on being _interested_ in opportunities—ask
  questions, build relationships, and seek out challenging experiences. While
  it’s important to be interesting in a job search, focusing too much on
  presenting yourself in this light can end up closing you off to new
  opportunities.

  ### Start. And Don’t Stop.


  > "Small actions, taken consistently every day, will lead you to positive
  outcomes, create momentum, and build your confidence."- Create Your Dream Job,
  page 77


  My mother is fond of saying: “you can have everything you want, you just
  probably can’t have it all at once.” Despite my best efforts at rebellion,
  I’ve really internalized this as one of my mantras. When you are consistent
  and deliberate, you can achieve results.


  Think about getting into better shape. Though we’d all prefer there to be a
  magic switch to flip that would make us instantly healthier, the reality is
  that repeated and deliberate actions are the only way to see results. One
  workout on its own is an anomaly. Four workouts a week for three months is a
  meaningful change. Consistent exercise over years can be revolutionary.


  It’s important to apply the same concept to our work. You can decide right now
  if you want to find a better job or start a business, but you won’t get very
  far without a plan. Make a commitment to expand your network, ask your
  contacts for job opportunities, or enrol in a business course. With deliberate
  and sustained action over time, you will begin to see results.

  ### Believe that your Dream Job Exists, and that you Deserve It


  > "Whether you are looking for a new job, training to become an elite athlete,
  saving for the future, getting healthy, or building a business, thought
  creates your reality."- Create Your Dream Job, page 2


  As a person who recently landed her dream job—after years of believing it was
  unattainable, that I had screwed up somewhere along the way in my career path
  and didn’t deserve the kind of happiness I aspired to, years of accepting the
  behavior of bad managers and uncooperative teammates—I can tell you that dream
  jobs do exist. To get there, you have to believe that you are capable and
  deserving of happiness at work.


  This first step is to adopt a positive mindset. Katz defines mindset as “a
  fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person’s responses
  to and interpretations of situations—that is, it’s an inclination or habit of
  mind” (page 38). If you are stuck in the mindset that your dream job is just a
  dream, that you don’t deserve to be engaged in your work, or that you aren’t
  qualified for the work you’d like to do, you will struggle to make meaningful
  change. If you shift your mindset to believe that finding your dream job is
  possible, it will help you to shift your behavior and achieve results quickly.
  Believe that career advancement is possible, and it will be, because you will
  start to take actions to achieve it.
f_conclusion: >-
  After two months of working at my dream job, I feel strongly that everyone
  deserves to do fulfilling work—we simply spend too much time working to stay
  stuck in dead-end, unhappy, unengaged work. Of course, dreams are different
  for everyone, and the path to fulfilling work will be different for each
  individual. Whatever stage you are at in your career journey, Katz provides
  actionable insights into how to pursue your dreams. If you’re one of the 70%
  of employees who are unhappy with their work, you can use the tactics outlined
  above to get started today.
