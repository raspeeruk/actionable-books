  ### From Fear to Courage


  > "The surprising, compelling mathematics of innovation: if you want more
  success, you have to be prepared to shrug off more failure"- Creative
  Confidence, page 41


  What makes you feel confident in a certain skill, activity or task? Is it the
  certainty that you understand every angle of what needs to be executed without
  failure? How did you gain that confidence in the first place? Experience?


  Tom and David stress that creativity is possible within all of us, but the
  biggest component that holds us back from achieving this skill is simple:
  failure. Failure to provide an idea, action, or concept that will be
  successful. However, Tom and David take failure and multiply it to be one of
  the biggest factors that everyone should incorporate in order to fully gain
  creative confidence.


  Instead of failure being viewed as negative, Tom and David shed light that
  failure is the stepping stones to enabling someone to get closer to their
  idea. Take the example of Thomas Edison’s creation of the light bulb. Everyone
  knows the _one_ successful light bulb, that Edison created; the final product.
  But what about the lightbulbs before it? It took Edison, 1000 failed light
  bulbs to come up with the one perfect product. Tom and David noted that
  Edison’s mindset of a failed lightbulb was not seen as a negative impact
  towards his idea, but a positive step to get closer to his ideal concept.
  Instead of thinking of the “one lightbulb” as a success, all 1000 bulbs were
  successful creations.


  In the workforce, the same idea can be applied. Instead of taking a failed
  idea or practice as a negative, use it as a benchmark to reflect on what needs
  to be modified to get you closer to that goal. Encouraging these moments to
  pause, reflect, observe what’s not working, and fine tune steers far away from
  the concept of a negative reaction – it just makes the idea stronger.
  _Creative Confidence_ encourages people to make more mistakes and “fail” when
  putting ideas into action. When that action fails – pause, reflect, tweak and
  move forward.

  ### Experiment with Side Projects


  > "Take the time to ask yourself each day, ‘When was I at my best?’"- Creative
  Confidence, page 165


  _Creative Confidence’s_ goal is to help increase a creative mindset within the
  workforce, however, Tom and David stress that sometimes ideas can be
  transferred based on additional side projects that are outside of work.
  Channelling similar methods of problem solving and self-reflection, the muscle
  memory can still be utilized and ultimately help bring new awareness back into
  the workforce that wasn’t possible.


  For example, try taking up a new hobby such as painting, learning a new sport
  or finally taking on the challenge to build furniture by yourself that you’ve
  bought from IKEA. While these projects may have no relation to what you do at
  work, Tom and David believe that the broader you expand your activities,
  projects, hobbies, etc., the stronger your creative skillset becomes and
  impacts what you do at work.

  ### Stop Planning and Start Acting


  > "It’s hard to be the ‘best’ right away, so commit to rapid and continuous
  improvements"- Creative Confidence, page 122


  A common trap starts with what stirs inside and never leaves the walls of a
  person’s cranium. How do we take a problem and come up with a creative
  solution? With the functionality of inexperience and fear of failure, many
  individuals are not able to take action on their creative ideas and implement
  them in their working environment. With everything comes practice; _Creative
  Confidence’s_ view of practice starts with immediate execution. Challenging us
  to not resist or perfect the idea that’s stirring inside our head, the book
  provides an “Action Catalyst” framework to give us a nudge and start acting.


  1.  **Get Help** – Share the problem or idea that you have. Maybe this is a
  team effort or requires someone who has experience in that area to help out.
  Two heads can be better than one.

  2.  **Create Peer Pressure** – Have someone be your personal accountability
  buddy. Everyone needs a nudge from someone else to keep you on top of your
  actions. David provides the example of using a personal trainer to motivate
  him to get to the gym and be active. Everyone needs help!

  3.  **Gather an Audience** – Recruit people who can listen and talk through
  your ideas. Brainstorming is a fantastic form of sparking those creative
  juices.

  4.  **Do a Bad Job** – Remove judgement and observe what was done. It provides
  the traction to get closer to that ideal solution.

  5.  **Lower the stakes** – No one is perfect, so don’t expect to have the
  ultimate solution on the first go. Aim small, and gradually build until you’re
  satisfied.

  How does this all relate back to creativity? _Creative Confidence_ reminds us
  that creativity doesn’t stem from being a musician or the ability to paint a
  picture – it is the mindset that can be applied when coming up with ideas and
  solutions within the workforce. Something anyone – regardless of their
  artistic experience – can take action on immediately and not be afraid to mess
  up and get closure on your own “idea”.

> "You don’t have to switch careers or move to Silicon Valley to change your mindset" _\- Creative Confidence, page 9_

“When you hear the word ‘creativity’, what do you think of next?” This is the opening line of _Creative Confidence_, where the reader is challenged to reflect on the principles that make up the word “creativity”. Do you think of a painter? Writer? Dancer? Steve Jobs? Immediately, the process of elimination comes into play – placing creativity farther and farther away from our grasp. The assumption that what is seen as “unique”, “different”, “aesthetically pleasing”, or “artistic” are the building blocks to creativity. While that can be a component, that’s not the only way in which this word can stretch towards**;** and that’s exactly what Tom and David Kelley emphasize within this book.

Creativity is not something that is limited to someone who is in the arts, but is in fact a skill that can be developed and worked on. Tom and David’s mantra towards creativity is simple: it’s within us all. Whether you’re an accountant, sales rep, project manager, IT analyst – creativity is a gain that anyone is capable of inheriting.

Utilizing the framework that built Tom and David Kelley’s d.school at Stanford, we are given a crash course on how creativity can be gained, how we can become confident with utilizing this newfound skill and how to take action immediately.
