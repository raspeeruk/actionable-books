  ### Give Yourself Permission to Fail


  > "The surprising, compelling mathematics of innovation: if you want more
  success, you have to be prepared to shrug off more failure."- Creative
  Confidence, page 41


  Take more shots on goal. Knock on more doors. Write more drafts. We’ve heard
  it all before. **If you want to succeed, you have to do more, and that means
  experience more failures.** The Kelley brothers refer to Thomas Edison, one of
  the most famous and prolific inventors in history, who said, “the real measure
  of success is the number of experiments that can be crowded into twenty-four
  hours.”


  Not much ‘genius’ in that. Just sounds like work and an insatiable desire to
  learn.


  The Kelleys maintain that the fear of failure is “still the single biggest
  obstacle people face to creative success.” **The real key to overcoming that
  fear is to work hard at failing.** It is changing our mindset from avoiding
  failure to seeking it as much as possible or necessary to obtain the success.
  In other words, if we want to be creative or innovative, we need give
  ourselves permission to fail. And organizations need to do the same for
  individuals or teams.


  Failing is learning. As they say at the Stanford Design School, **“Failure
  sucks, but instructs.”** In _Creative Confidence_, Tom Kelley tells a story
  about his teenage son opening a Christmas present of a Tony Hawk skateboard
  video game, and having the family watch failure after failure as the son
  repeatedly crashed into walls, skidded off railings, and collided with other
  skaters without phasing him one bit. He continued to play with what the
  Kelleys coined as ‘**urgent optimism**’. In the context of the gaming world,
  he wasn’t really failing, he was on a path to learning, in fact “the only path
  available to gaining expertise.” He was so optimistic about his eventual
  success that failures were quite okay, and even necessary.


  **Maybe we ought to look at life more like a video game and try to master the
  highest level quickly, blasting through the failures as fast as we can.**

  ### Stop Planning and Start Acting


  > "If you want to make something great, you need to start making."- Creative
  Confidence, page 123


  People with creative confidence are not passive observers. Even in tough times
  they don’t act or feel like victims. “They believe their actions can make a
  positive difference, so they act.” Instead of waiting for a perfect plan, they
  move forward, optimistic about their ability to make course corrections down
  the road if necessary.


  It’s okay to be sloppy, at least at first. **Perfectionism slows you down.**
  When we over plan and procrastinate it is a sign that we’re afraid, that we
  just don’t feel ready. I should know. I feel it all the time. But I also know
  that the greatest feeling comes from accomplishment or progress, from knowing
  you took action. The more you act, the less fearful it becomes.


  When it’s hard for us to act, the Kelley brothers suggest some ‘**action
  catalysts**’.


  1\. Get help  

  2\. Create peer pressure  

  3\. Gather an audience  

  4\. Do a bad job  

  5\. Lower the stakes


  They also suggest using ‘**creative constraints**’ to fuel action. Everyone
  wants more budget, more time, and more people to get things done, but if you
  create specific constraints, it’s amazing what ideas people can generate.
  Instead of a month-long project, do it in a day. Instead of large funding,
  what could you do with $100?

  ### Choose Creativity


  > "To be more creative, the first step is to decide you want to make it
  happen."- Creative Confidence, page 74


  Over the years, the Kelley brothers have discovered several effective
  strategies that can get you from a blank page to insight. The first one is
  simply to ‘choose creativity.’


  **It comes down to a choice. If you don’t do this first, you definitely won’t
  be creative.** You know creativity when you see it. The problem is, we often
  compare extreme creativity with what we usually produce and think, “I could
  never do that.”


  But the reality is that creativity is relative. What’s creative for you may
  not be for someone else. That’s okay. **Start from where you are.** Do
  something different or creative from your perspective. It doesn’t matter if
  it’s been done before, or it isn’t pretty. You can build off of others ideas.
  “Being creative doesn’t have to mean starting from scratch or being the sole
  originator – it’s about adding what you can, about making a creative
  contribution.”


  The Kelley brothers reference research done by psychologist Robert Sternberg
  who says creative people tend to:


  *   redefine problems in new ways

  *   take sensible risks and accept failure as part of the process

  *   confront obstacles

  *   tolerate ambiguity

  *   continue to grow intellectually


  Being creative is a mindset, one that starts with a choice.


  **My choice is to think of something creative to do every day.** Whether
  that’s standing on one leg for a while or drawing a picture in my meeting
  notes, it doesn’t take much to choose creativity. Then, when I have the habit
  or mindset, I’ll consistently apply it to the more difficult problems.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Creative Confidence_ was one of the best books I’ve read all year because it
  combines motivation and practical steps for being more creative, along with
  plenty of interesting stories and research that validates their concepts.

> "Everything in modern society is the result of a collection of decisions made by someone. Why shouldn’t that someone be you?" _\- Creative Confidence, page 32_

**Everyone is a creator.** It’s what you do all day, every day. You are creating something, whether you intend to or not. An interaction, a memory, an artifact, an impression, everything you do is creating an experience for someone else or yourself. So if you’re one of those people who say “I’m just not the creative type,” that’s not going to cut it.

In fact, in Tom and David Kelley’s experience, **everybody is the creative type.** They’ve seen it in workshops and seminars time and time again, business types and executives always feel uncomfortable during the fuzzy or unconventional exercises (like improv) but after they stick with it for a while and let go of their insecurities about what is ‘supposed’ to happen, they find out that they have an imagination too, and it’s ok to use it.

The Kelley brothers’ latest book, _Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All_, is about helping people rediscover what they already have: the capacity to imagine or build upon new ideas, and the confidence to act on those ideas to make change in the world.

This book changed my outlook on how I approach what I do at work, and life in general. I’m definitely taking some action after soaking up this treasure.

If I believe in my ability to create change in the world around me then I’m more likely to achieve what I set out to do, and that’s when I have creative confidence.

_Creative Confidence_ was one of the best books I’ve read all year because it combines motivation and practical steps for being more creative, along with plenty of interesting stories and research that validates their concepts.

My plan for creativity is to accomplish more failures (yeah!) by choosing to be creative and taking action.

_How will you become more creative by being a friend of failure?_
