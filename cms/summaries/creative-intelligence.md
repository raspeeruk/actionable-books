  ### Creativity is Social


  > "Creative Intelligence is social: We increase our creative ability by
  learning from others, collaborating, sharing."- Creative Intelligence, page 30


  Contrary to popular opinion, the most creative people operate not in seclusion
  but in a community. Drawing from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s and R. Keith
  Sawyer’s study of Italian Renaissance art, Nussbaum explains this surprising
  truth. As Sawyer noted from his study of Artificial Intelligence, “AI missed
  the interactional dimension where creativity takes place.”


  This _interactional effect_ is also noted by musicians of all types and has
  been shown to be one of the keys to innovation that Nussbaum was originally
  searching. Whether at Proctor & Gamble or Apple (non-siloed vs. siloed
  organizations), it was in the collaboration of individuals, rather than lone
  effort, that led to those innovations. Collaboration and sharing are
  essential.

  ### Indie Capitalism


  > "Creativity drives capitalism. Indie Capitalism emphasizes the economic
  value generated by the creation of new products and services."- Creative
  Intelligence, page 239


  As our society begins to recover from the economic collapse of 2008, Nussbaum
  outlines a new form of capitalism predicated upon entrepreneurial cultures,
  creativity, and innovation. He encourages the creation of a new economic model
  based upon Creative Intelligence, suggesting some foundational truths:


  1\. **Creativity** is the source of economic value.  

  2\. **Uncertainty** is the state of social and economic life.  

  3\. The entrepreneur drives **economic growth**.  

  4\. **Capitalism** is a social movement.  

  5\. **Social networks** are the basic building blocks of the economy.  

  6\. **Creative destruction** is key to innovation-led economic growth.


  Earlier this year, I began implementing the habit of play into my daily life,
  and it’s served me well to drive new ideas – primarily because it gives my
  brain a break from obsessive worrying and helps my subconscious form
  connections and ideas. With _Creative Intelligence_, I found Framing as an
  extremely useful tool for creativity in my work. When I take the time to
  “re-write the story,” I often find nuances I previously overlooked or new
  questions that had gone unasked.


  I also found _Creative Intelligence_ fascinating for its discussion of
  creativity habits and its outlook on a new capitalism. I’ve been witness to
  the kinds of businesses that are led by these same principles – uncertainty,
  destruction, social components, and pivoting. This is a subject I’m sure to
  come back to frequently.


  _What about you? What creative habits are most familiar to you? What can you
  add to your daily life to increase your Creative Intelligence? Are you
  currently participating in Indie Capitalism? (Perhaps you lacked a name for
  it!) If so, what does that look like?_

  ### The Five Competencies of Creative Intelligence


  > "The five competencies…aren’t simply best practices for organizations to
  transform themselves; they are tools that can help you plot a career path if
  you’re young and transform your career if you’re not."- Creative Intelligence,
  page 33


  The bulk of _Creative Intelligence_ is given to describing the five
  competencies and outlining habits and mindsets of the world’s most creative
  people. Composed entirely of stories, these chapters give us glimpses of the
  kinds of habits that are necessary to promote and harness our own creativity.


  Nussbaum describes the competencies as:


  1. **Knowledge Mining** – studying what came before, mashing-up seemingly
  unrelated fields or bodies of knowledge, being aware of your own knowledge and
  skills as you look for connections. Knowledge Mining comes in varying forms.


  a) **Embodiment** – know yourself and your place in the world  

  b) **Immersion** – study, practice, and curiosity  

  c) **Connecting Dots** – seeking connections  

  d) **Donut Knowledge** – looking for what isn’t there  

  e) **Dreams, Not Needs** – what is meaningful rather than merely useful


  2\. Framing – interpreting the world through specific, varied lenses


  a) **Narrative Framing** – rewrite the story  

  b) **Engagement Framing** – look for human engagement and interaction  

  c) **What-If Framing** – imagine beyond the possible


  3\. **Playing** – generate creativity by having fun


  4\. **Making** – learn the tools necessary to build something and then build
  it


  5\. **Pivoting** – scaling from inspiration to production

Bruce Nussbaum’s extensive research into corporate innovation forms the basis of his writing in _Creative Intelligence_. What began as a study of the key attributes of the world’s most innovative companies resulted in more questions than answers. Breaking down silos, as seen in Proctor & Gamble, simply didn’t work at Apple (long considered the most innovative company) where silos were essential.

The challenge raised by the research and in interviews with design and academic leadership took Nussbaum’s study further. What resulted was a different question. Not just “What do the most innovative companies have in common?”, but rather “What is the code for creativity and how can corporations and individuals harness it?”

Drawing on the aforementioned research and weaving in stories of creativity as varied as rock stars and CIA directors, Nussbaum outlines the competencies of creativity and its value in our lives and work.
