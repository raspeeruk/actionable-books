  ### Marrying Creativity with Strategy


  > "…analysis and creativity work together in all modes of thought. You cannot
  have an idea without both."- Creative Strategy, page 2


  Traditionally, we have held that creativity is open and strategy focused –
  generating from two separate parts of our brain. We manage them separately and
  then try to combine the results in some way at a later stage. _Creative
  Strategy_ makes this a one step process by marrying creativity (the generation
  of new ideas) with efficiency (based on what we already know is working
  elsewhere) and strategy (addressing only the key elements that are at the core
  of our challenges). The fusing of these domains into one guided process
  **provides the missing piece for many innovation efforts.**


  Most importantly, _Creative Strategy_ could spawn even greater corporate
  acceptance for more organized innovation efforts as it is a more “prudent way
  to experiment”. Following the what-works matrix and process will allow you to
  explain why your new idea is worth a try since it is a creative combination of
  past elements that have worked. _Creative Strategy_ essentially provides a
  potentially **better ROI – return on ideas** – for management than random “try
  anything” notions, “wild ideas” or purely imaginative flights of fancy.


  Further addressing efficiency, and backed by neuroscience, _Creative Strategy_
  as a methodology and thought process closely follows what we now know about
  optimal brain functioning. The “learning-and-memory” brain model has replaced
  the “two brain” (left brain-right brain) model as the current working basis of
  human brain functioning. “In this model, analysis and intuition are not two
  different kinds of thought, in two different locations, but operates
  throughout the brain as is proven by neuroscience”. It should follow that the
  methods of strategy and the methods of creativity have a connection and there
  is no need for conducting two separate sessions. Creative strategy offers a
  formal method that **mirrors the way the brain works**.

  ### Slaughtering sacred cows


  > "Creative Strategy comes much closer to how innovations actually happen."-
  Creative Strategy, page 107


  The second part of the book bravely dedicates itself to pointing out the flaws
  of the major business methods being used and touted today and explains how to
  alter them to make room for creative strategy. Duggan reviews a cross-section
  of creativity methods such as design thinking, Dragon’s Den, mind mapping,
  play, time off and TRIZ. He dissects strategy methods such as [Blue
  Ocean](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/blue-ocean-strategy/), case
  method, systems thinking, SWOT, and gap analysis. He takes on Bain & Company’s
  annual survey of most used management tools, and a wide range of management
  and creativity staples like Jim Collin’s [_Good to
  Great_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/good-to-great/)_,_ Larry Bossidy
  and Ram Charan’s
  [_Execution_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/execution/)_,_ Clay
  Christensen’s _Innovator’s Dilemma & Innovator’s Solution,_ Ed de Bono’s _Six
  Hats Thinking_ and Michael Porter’s _Competitive Strategy._ It is quite an
  undertaking.


  On his **review of creative methods**, he points out that many of these
  methods try to “stir up the pot of your mind so creative ideas pop out” which
  amount to “stimulating the right side of your brain “, not producing a
  strategy. You wind up facing a universe of possibilities and no guidance at
  all for how to decide which one to choose.


  On his **review of strategy methods**, he warns that they are incomplete
  methods. They help organize your thoughts – how to analyze a problem, but do
  not help you find a solution. You take an analytical framework that describes
  your current situation and “then have to make a magical leap to fill in the
  framework for the future you desire”.


  The actionable item here is to actively use Duggan’s book as a way to
  challenge your thinking and your sacred cows. The first step in being more
  innovative starts with a cold, hard look at what you are currently doing and
  what are your guiding beliefs. _Creative Strategy_ becomes a singular book
  **offering a different lens** to review the major management, strategy and
  creativity processes in vogue today in relation to innovation creation. This
  activity may help you expand or fine-tune your innovation toolkit.

  ### Break the paradigm


  > "The most common mistake in methods of innovation, creation and strategy is
  to rely on some type of formal or informal brainstorming to fill the gap
  between analysis and planning."- Creative Strategy, page 73


  Duggan is not a fan of brainstorming as it “relies on ideas just popping into
  your head in a matter of minutes”. Brain connections (good ideas), on the
  other hand, take time. Standard advice of brainstorming is to “encourage wild
  ideas”, “go for quantity”. _Creative Strategy_ is very different: “look for
  pieces of the puzzle that someone, somewhere has already solved to some
  degree”. It is a treasure hunt that goes for quality.


  Duggan states definitively that the what-works matrix and scan exercise create
  a better process for groups to work with. They **focus, fine tune, and direct
  thinking** toward definitive solutions, not just a lot of random ideas.
  Participants are being very selective, looking for exact examples needed that
  address particular elements of the problem, then combine them into new ideas
  that target the specific challenges at hand. Duggan characterizes it as “being
  a detective, spending time searching for solutions, not studying the problem.”


  It’s important to break the habit, the corporate “inertia”, of following the
  “classic mistake” of focusing on elaborate analysis followed by conducting
  brainstorming sessions to “generate solutions”. “This yields strong analysis
  and weak solutions” and follows the old left brain/right brain model. Replace
  this standard course of action with his creative strategy phases of:


  1\. **Rapid appraisal**: Break the problem into parts (most important
  elements)  

  2\. **What-works scan**: Search widely for sources/examples of previously
  successful actions that address each element  

  3\. **Creative combination:** Allow the brain to have flashes of insight in
  finding new combinations of elements.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Creative Strategy_ is a brave work, like innovation itself, standing up to
  challenge status quo thinking. It deserves attention as it provides a **much**
  **needed innovation creation process that strongly addresses real world
  constraints**.

_Creative Strategy_ **uniquely contributes to the body of innovation literature** by answering the toughest innovation questions of them all: _How?_ How do you get innovative ideas? How do you decide on which ideas to pursue? How do you bridge from analysis to execution? _How exactly?_

In his previous book, [_Strategic Intuition_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/strategic-intuition/), Columbia Business School Professor William Duggan laid out his case on how innovation works in our brains: flashes of insight that combine knowledge and experience (stored in our brains and in the world around us) to create new, innovative ideas. He left us with a 4 step mental process to generate innovative ideas and a team tool, the ‘what-works’ matrix, to use in a group setting.

In _Creative Strategy,_ his follow-up book, Duggan goes into more detail on the steps of his proposed methodology and provides an extensive workbook on the process of how to _apply_ strategic intuition to the real world. That process he calls _creative strategy_. His book succeeds in motivating the reader to take the tangible and confident steps needed to use creative strategy in business and personal life.
