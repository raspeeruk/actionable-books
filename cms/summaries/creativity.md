  ### Cultivate Curiosity and Interest


  > "Creative individuals are childlike in that their curiosity remains fresh
  even at ninety years of age; they delight in the strange and the unknown. And
  because there is no end to the unknown, their delight also is endless."-
  Creativity, page 346


  Creative innovators often channel their curiosity into a genuinely
  interesting, particular occupation. The most ordinary things are mysterious to
  children, but as adults, we lose our sense of awe and life becomes routine. It
  is possible for all of us to cultivate more curiosity and interest. As we
  become more curious and interested, we allocate our attention to things for
  their sake and discovery becomes its reward.


  Become engaged and interested. Notice the differences in things around you.
  Surprise yourself, look for remarkable features in foods you eat, people you
  meet and things you see. We tend to be creatures of habit. Surprise others,
  break your routines, say something unexpected or ask someone to go someplace
  or do something new with you. Experiment with your appearance. Write down your
  new observations and experiences so that you can relive them and see a pattern
  of emerging interests. Once you discover new things that capture your
  interest, learn more about them and continue developing curiosity.

  ### Develop Creative Personality Traits


  > "To change personality means to learn new patterns of attention. To look at
  different things, and to look at them differently; to learn to think new
  thoughts, have new feelings about what we experience."- Creativity, page 359


  Creative personalities are flexible. Csikszentmihalyi acknowledges that
  changing our personality—our habitual way of thinking, feeling, and acting—is
  hard. If we spent the same amount of time and energy enhancing our psyche as
  our appearance, we could solve many problems. He uses an example of an
  introvert deciding to become more extroverted. I was very introverted as a
  child, but as an adult, I realized I would miss valuable opportunities unless
  I decided to become more extroverted. As a result, I discovered extroversion
  is an enjoyable part of my nature, and I was able to contribute more by
  connecting with others.


  Developing traits that you lack is one way of creating more flexibility in
  your character. Another way is to allow your mind to wander, and then shift to
  concentration. Alternating between being open and receptive, and focused
  promotes discovery of new facts and generates connections between them. Aim
  for complexity. Become comfortable with opposing tendencies. Developing a more
  flexible personality enhances creative insight.

  ### Develop Habits to Avoid Distractions


  > "We must erect barriers against distractions, dig channels so that energy
  can flow more freely, find ways to escape outside temptations and
  interruptions. If we do not, entropy is sure to break down the concentration
  that the pursuit of interest requires. Then thought returns to its baseline
  state — the vague, unfocused, constantly distracted condition of the normal
  mind."- Creativity, page 351


  Find time for emerging interests. Organize time, space, and activity to your
  advantage. Mundane tasks are some of the worst thieves of time and energy.
  Simplifying everyday tasks like dressing, cleaning, eating, shopping, and
  chores can free hours of time for creative thought. Increase your efficiency,
  identify the time when your creative energy is most productive and alter your
  schedule to fit your natural rhythm. Adjust your sleep routine if it clashes
  with your intrinsic orientation. For example, I sleep about five hours a
  night, but I find spending two or three additional hours in bed contemplating
  optimizes my energy, while longer periods of rest leave me agitated. What is
  your optimal routine?


  Avoid constant busyness. If you feel uncomfortable when you are not engaged in
  a task, consider your work to be taking the time to reflect, and allow new
  ideas to evolve. Relaxation for reflection does not need to be idle, and it
  may involve an activity like walking, showering, or crafting. Engage in
  activities different from your usual tasks to allow your mind to work in
  various ways. Organize your space to harmonize with your activity: you don’t
  want to be constantly interrupted to look for something. Your environment
  should be neutral and not interrupt creative thought.
f_conclusion: >-
  Expanding personal creativity enhances our lives and enables us to make a
  greater contribution. Cultivating a sense of curiosity and wonder establishes
  new interests. Developing habits to protect our time and creative energy
  provides the time and energy required to pursue our broadening and evolving
  interests. Improving flexibility in our personality promotes feeling
  comfortable with paradox and diverse aspects of our personality. Practicing
  these things enhances our creativity and leads to more discovery and
  enjoyment.

  “Luck has a huge hand in deciding whose C is capitalized. But, if you don’t
  learn to be creative in your personal life, the chances of contributing to the
  culture drop to even closer to zero. And what really matters, in the last
  account, is not whether your name has been attached to a recognized discovery,
  but whether you have lived a full and creative life.”

In _Creativity: The Psychology of Discovery and Inventio_n Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explores the creative process, creative people’s lives, and how creativity transforms culture. He also wrote [_Finding Flow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/finding-flow/) and uses flow theory in explaining the creative process. Creativity is the result of the human mind interacting with its surroundings to shape the world. Our language, artistic expression, scientific understanding, technology, and values, distinguish human creation from any organic or random expression in nature. This human expression creates a feeling of personal fulfillment and cultural meaning. Creative accomplishments that change our culture are the result of a synergy of many sources and not a single mind or a sudden insight. Those individuals that channel this synergy and made a significant difference in their domain of culture are the ones who are “creative with a capital c” and the subject of the research which is the basis for this book.

Csikszentmihalyi chose ninety-one remarkable innovators as participants for his research from a range of cultural domains including the arts, science, and business. He included successful, influential writers such as Madeline L’Engle, scientists like astronomer Vera Rubin, and business leaders like John Reed, former CEO of Citicorp (now Citigroup, my employer). Through interviews, he identified commonalities and identified the traits, behaviors, circumstances, and experiences that contribute to individual creativity (which in turn contribute to cultural change).

This book is incredibly insightful and useful in understanding individual creativity and cultural innovation. It is unusual to possess the unique traits and serendipity of circumstances which allow an individual to make a cultural change, but, we can all practice creativity. For this summary, I will focus on how we can increase creativity in our lives to enrich our experience and enhance our work.
