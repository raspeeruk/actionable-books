  ### Pivot to your customers


  > "\[Companies\] need to collaborate with their customers, not just manage
  relationships with them."- CRM at the Speed of Light, page 105


  _CRM at the Speed of Light_ focuses on the importance of collaborating with
  your customers. CRMs need to go beyond the traditional focus on operations. No
  longer is it enough for a CRM to simply collect data or be an internal tool
  for the sales, marketing, and service teams.


  With the technology we have available today, CRMs can help open up
  conversations with customers. Whether it is through integration with social
  media, blogs, podcasts, wikis, customer communities, there are many ways you
  can be where your customers are.


  By opening up a dialogue with your customers you gain better data, profiles of
  customers, and customer insight which can turn into valuable feedback, new
  product ideas, and a more engaged customer base. Not to mention the increase
  in sales and customer satisfaction!


  So here are a few questions to ponder on how you can pivot to your customers:


  Where can you find your customers? Does your current system allow you to
  interact with them? How are you collecting data from these interactions?

  ### Create your evaluation criteria


  > "Before we go too far down the path of evaluating technology and other
  solutions, let’s pause to make sure you are ready to select, implement,
  deliver, and support your CRM investment. A solid understanding of the
  business, process, and customer experience goals is imperative prior to
  selecting any technology."- CRM at the Speed of Light, page 594


  There are so many options available for CRMs today and it will take many
  months just to comb through the options. But here are a few things to think
  about as you make your decision so you can craft out your own evaluation
  criteria.


  *   On-Premise or Cloud based

  *   Customization

  *   Cost/Total Cost of Ownership

  *   Expected ROI

  *   Mobile capabilities


  Furthermore, there should be honest discussions within the company about the
  following:


  *   CRM strategy and vision;

  *   Value-add to customers;

  *   Buy-in from key stakeholders;

  *   Definition/metrics of success; and

  *   Documented business and customer processes.


  The above criteria would be good places to start but if you want to dig deeper
  into them I would recommend picking up the book as it will give you greater
  insight on what each criteria should be based on.

  ### Institutionalize best practices via technology


  > "CRM is a philosophy and a business strategy supported by a system and a
  technology designed to improve human interactions in a business environment."-
  CRM at the Speed of Light, page 30


  In Part II of the book, Greenberg focuses on the operational as there is no
  doubt that the operational remains an important aspect of CRM. If a CRM system
  can create efficiencies for customer-facing departments like sales, service,
  and marketing, your reps have more time selling and servicing.


  What resonated with me in this section was how CRM can help institutionalize
  company best practices with technology. For example, a commonly asked question
  in companies is “do we have great sales or customer service people?” But what
  if we reframe the question and ask:


  _“How do we institutionalize the kinds of practices, culture, and technologies
  to provide a customer with the kind of experience that makes him or her think
  of us as a ‘company like me’’._


  _Which has a corollary:_


  _“When that great customer service person leaves us, how do we
  institutionalize all those practices, culture, and technologies so that we can
  easily replicate those capabilities?'”_


  CRMs that institutionalize best practices have a much higher likelihood of
  adoption and will make employees more productive. So how are you capturing
  your best practices? If a rep leaves, how long does it take the new hire to
  pick things up?

  For those looking to gain a deeper level of understanding about the CRM world,
  I highly recommend picking up this book. If you’re still new and want some
  simpler ways to get started, you can always start with Greenberg’s blog which
  can be found [here](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/crm/). Finally, after a brief
  Twitter interchange, Greenberg has mentioned there is a fifth edition coming
  out soon so keep an eye out for that.

CRM or Customer Relationship Management is a system used by many businesses to manage their customer relationships. It is a system used to capture customer data and provide customer insight to the sales, marketing, and service teams. In recent years CRMs have become increasingly complex with the mountain of information available via the internet and increased customer sophistication.

Paul Greenberg has been the thought leader for the CRM industry for many years and the latest edition of _CRM at the Speed of Light_ is now in its fourth version. A lot has changed since the early days of CRM in the 90s to today. In his book, Greenberg explains the shift of CRMs from an operationally-focused tool to a customer-centric platform.

It’s a well written, detailed book. Much of the finer details have to be left out (or we’ll be here forever!) so I highly recommend picking it up if the takeaways below resonate with you.
