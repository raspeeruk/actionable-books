  ### Fill the Pool


  > "When it comes to risky, controversial, and emotional conversations, skilled
  people find a way to get all relevant information (from themselves and others)
  out into the open."- Crucial Conversation, page 20w


  One of the dominant ideas in _Crucial Conversation_ is that of the “Pool of
  Shared Meaning.” Effectively, it’s much easier to have a productive
  conversation when we’re all looking at the issue at hand from a collective
  understanding. Alas, this is **much** easier said than done. As human beings,
  we have our own experiences, our own suspicions, and our own stories that can
  (and usually do) muddy up the pool. The objective, then, is to constantly look
  for ways to add as many of the relevant stories, facts, and emotions to the
  **shared** pool. It’s the “shared” part that we’re striving for, here. Crucial
  conversations are only resolved effectively when others in the conversation
  are made aware of, and understand, our stories, facts, and emotions. (And vice
  versa!).


  Let’s look at a couple factors that can get in the way (and what to do about
  them).

  ### Choose your own adventure (story)


  > "The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion
  that what you're feeling is the only right emotion under the circumstances."-
  Crucial Conversations, page 104


  Here’s the fascinating path our brains take in processing information:


  **Input of facts:** We see, hear, smell or taste something.


  **Creation of a story:** To make sense of the world, our brains are fantastic
  at using those facts to create stories. _We hear a siren and we see smoke a
  few blocks over._ (These are facts.) _“Oh my gosh, a house is on fire!” we say
  to ourselves_. (This is a story). Did we see the fire? No. But our brains
  connect the dots. A really valuable skill… until it isn’t.


  **Emotions unfold:** As we tell ourselves a story, we automatically begin to
  judge. We layer emotions onto the story. _“Oh my gosh, I hope it’s not Karen’s
  house that’s on fire!”_ We get worried, angry, excited, jealous, etc.,
  depending on the story we tell ourselves.


  **We take action:** The emotions guide us to action. _We run down the street
  in our pyjamas, visions of being Karen’s rescuer playing out in our minds…
  until we turn the corner and see that it’s just someone burning leaves… and we
  realize the siren is totally unrelated. Then Karen walks by and gives you a
  funny look._


  So here’s the challenge: if we assume the story we tell ourselves is _actually
  a fact_, and not just based on facts, we can easily start to validate our
  emotions and actions as being the only reasonable course of action. **Could**
  Karen’s house have been on fire? Sure! But that’s only one possible outcome,
  and responding to **stories** as though they are **facts** can often be the
  cause of some unnecessarily rough conversations. (Or embarrassing moments.)


  You’re not omnipotent. You don’t have all the facts. You **_may_** be right,
  but at least give yourself the opening to hear more information before you
  jump to conclusions. You can even turn it into a game:


  “Ok, that’s **one** story. What other reasons could there be for those facts?”
  (How many can you come up with?)

  ### Vigilantly Watch for Silence and Violence


  > "Dialogue calls for the free flow of meaning - period. And nothing kills the
  flow of meaning like fear. When you fear that people aren't buying into your
  ideas, you start pushing too hard. When you fear that you may be harmed in
  some way, you start withdrawing and hiding."- Crucial Conversations, page 49


  When you find yourself in an uncomfortable conversation, do you clam up? Or do
  you go on the offensive? As the authors of _Crucial Conversations_ explain,
  we’re genetically conditioned to enter a “Fight or Flight” mentality when we
  find ourselves in less-than-safe situations. Our breathing quickens,
  adrenaline shoots through our bodies, and our blood flows to our limbs, better
  enabling us to respond physically. While this may be helpful when faced with a
  real, physical attack, it’s about the **least** helpful response we could have
  in a crucial conversation. Think about it – if blood is moving to our limbs,
  then it’s moving away from our brains, making it harder for us to think and
  respond rationally.


  Thankfully, there are indicators we can watch for and correct, when we enter
  this “Fight or Flight” mentality. The authors label them “silence” and
  “violence”.


  Indicators of Silence:


  *   Masking emotions and true feelings

  *   Avoiding the uncomfortable topic

  *   Withdrawing from the conversation


  Indicators of Violence:


  *   Controlling the conversation

  *   Labelling the other person or their views

  *   Attacking, through sarcasm or insults


  Any of those sound familiar? Any of these tactics are virtually guaranteed to
  take you further from rational conversation and a positive outcome.


  So how do we overcome them? The authors suggest refocusing on what you _really
  want to get out of the interaction._


  *   What do you want for you?

  *   What do you want for the other person?

  *   What do you want for this relationship?

  *   and (here’s the kicker) **How would you be acting if you really wanted
  that?**


  It’s called “Making it Safe,” and by focusing on these questions, we redirect
  our bodies to **think –** to answer the higher level questions, and restore
  blood flow to its proper balance. “Making it Safe” is a powerful tool in
  engaging in rich, meaningful conversation.

  It’s been a long time since I’ve read a book that was as valuable as _Crucial
  Conversations._ It is fairly impressive how much content and insight the
  authors have been able to condense into 228 pages. I was highlighting every
  other page, and scribbling notes throughout, which is maybe why I laughed out
  loud at this line: _“If you read the previous pages in a short period of time,
  you probably feel like an anaconda who just swallowed a warthog. It’s a lot to
  digest.”_

Maybe what makes _Crucial Conversations_ so valuable is its application beyond business. Crucial conversations take place in all aspects of our lives, and learning to master them is bound to be one of the core tools for a happier, healthier life. It’s fun, it’s digestible, it’s applicable to all. Buy this book.
