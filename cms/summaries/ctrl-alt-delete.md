  ### You're not really customer focused


  > "Customer-focused in 2013 means looking at things as a consumer and not as a
  businessperson."- Ctrl Alt Delete, page 15


  You’re not _really_ customer focused. If you were, you wouldn’t be trying to
  push the same ads on Facebook as you are on LinkedIn, as you are on Google
  Ads. If you took a minute to think about it **as a customer**, you’d realize
  that you’re in a totally different headspace when you’re on these different
  platforms.


  There’s a subtle, yet powerful shift that happened for me when I read the
  quote above. How often do we think we’re being “customer-centric” when we try
  to design products, services or features for the customer’s best interest?
  Mitch’s shift in thinking on this is to actually **_start_** from the
  consumer’s perspective. **To be the consumer.** It’s a matter of putting
  yourself on the same side of the fence as the end user, rather than looking
  over that fence from the business side and being analytical about what you
  think they want (or should want).


  _How do_ **_you_** _use Facebook? What kind of ads do you like to see when
  you’re in a “Facebook headspace”? How does that differ from a “Google-search
  headspace”?_


  Like I said, it’s a subtle shift, but a powerful one, and one that breeds
  authenticity, loyalty and excitement. It’s also a refreshing viewpoint to
  take.

  ### Less Content (Yes, Really)


  > "Instead of looking at your content calendar or barking at someone in your
  organization to tweet more frequently, take a fifteen-minute siesta and ask
  yourself this one question: What great stories can we tell? Stop thinking
  about content as the endgame and consider that the true value is the stories
  you tell."- Ctrl Alt Delete, page 195


  If you’re a business owner, or a marketing professional, this one is for you.
  With the roar of constant noise generated by a million brands pumping a
  million ads into every conceivable online channel, there can be an incredible
  pressure to feel that we need to keep pace or risk becoming irrelevant. Mitch
  disagrees.


  Instead of thinking about how to put out more content, let’s take a pause and
  consider, instead, how to produce **great** content. Content that resonates
  with our customers. Content that tells a story – no, a **great** **story** –
  and is distributed through a channel that makes sense for that story. As we
  discussed in the The Big Idea, not all channels are created equal; **a story
  that resonates on Facebook is not the same as the one that people connect with
  on Twitter, LinkedIn or a blog.** The content of your great stories needs to
  resonate, but so does the context. Craft great stories that will be of
  interest to your customers, determine the appropriate channel to share it with
  them, and only **then** click “publish”. In a world drowning in noise, less is
  more. **Stand out from the crowd.**

  In [_Brand New
  World_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/brand-new-world/)_,_ Max
  Lenderman wrote about Charmin creating an iPhone app – called “[sit or
  squat](http://www.charmin.com/find-public-restrooms.aspx)” that helped you
  find the best public restrooms nearby, using your phones GPS locator. (It’s
  since been added to the Android platform as well.) Sit or Squat has been a
  fantastically successful app since its introduction 4 years ago, and no doubt
  excellent exposure for the toilet paper company.


  But you have to imagine what the boardroom conversation looked like when the
  concept of the app was first suggested:


  _“Where’s the ROI?”_ laments the CFO.


  _“What’s the total reach and number of impressions?”_ asks the CMO.


  New mediums require new ways of thinking about marketing. **Utilitarianism
  marketing** (ie. the creation of something actually useful to your client
  base, provided without a price tag) is a new way of thinking about brand
  exposure and customer relationship development. What’s the ROI on Charmin’s
  _Sit or Squat_ campaign? It’s hard to say. But is it any harder to identify
  than the ROI of a series of bus shelter ads? More importantly, when we think
  about the campaign from the consumer mindset, which one is more valuable?
  Which one is more memorable? **Which one strengthens the consumer’s loyalty to
  the brand?**


  It doesn’t have to be through an app, but we do need to think more
  holistically about the needs of our customers, and how we can provide them
  with value. You’d hold the door open for a customer leaving your store,
  wouldn’t you? **What’s your digital equivalent?**

  one hand, I feel like I’m doing you a disservice, not going into detail on
  other brilliant concepts from the book; like what it means to have a

  the other hand, it’s always a testament to the value one can gain from reading

> "In short, when something goes wrong: reboot." _\- Ctrl Alt Delete, page 234_

Here’s a trend I’m seeing (and I love it). **The forward thinking minds of the marketing world are starting to write books that are exceptionally human in nature.** They’re easy to read (even if you’re not from the industry), and they’re focused as much on individual objectives as they are on business goals.

_Ctrl Alt Delete_, the second book from Mitch Joel (author of [_Six Pixels of Separation_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/six-pixels-of-separation/)) ranks as one of the best to date. The book is written as two interconnected halves – “Reboot: Business”, and “Reboot: You”. **So what and why are we rebooting, exactly?**

As Mitch elegantly demonstrates, there’s a disconnect between our mindset as marketers and consumers. As marketers (whether that’s selling a product, service or ourselves as individuals), we tend to assume consumers will act in a way that is actually completely different than we actually operate, as consumers. As marketers we assume certain things that, as consumers, we know aren’t true. More importantly, these consumer behaviors aren’t going away. They’re not a trend. And so, we need to shift our mindsets in some small but fundamental ways, or risk becoming irrelevant. We need to start over. We need to reboot.

I often hear people lament that most business books are really a 2 page article with 258 pages of filler. And in some cases, that’s sadly true. Not so with _Ctrl Alt Delete_. In these 260 pages lies a wealth of insight, cutting edge thinking from one of the greatest contemporary minds in marketing, and not just a few thought provoking stories. Whether you’re a business owner, marketing professional, or simply an individual looking to thrive in our digital world, do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
