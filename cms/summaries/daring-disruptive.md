  ### Eliminating Fear


  > "Fears are educated into us, and can, if we wish, be educated out."- Karl
  Menninger, Daring & Disruptive, page 27


  Lisa’s three-part approach to fear is as follows:


  1.  Prepare for your worst-case scenario by devising steps towards prevention,
  as well as an educated solution should your worst-case scenario ever come to
  be. Having a plan in place will reduce fear of the unknown, simply by making
  it known. By walking through the experience of failure in your head, and
  deciding on the best way to deal with failure every step of the way, you not
  only become comfortable with the possibility of your fears being realized, but
  you also produce a plan to prevent it from happening.


  2.  Detach yourself from the outcome, and fail fast. Spending time, energy and
  money to predict and prepare for a possible outcome can set you back and
  suffocate the project before it even begins. It also gives you ample
  opportunity to overthink and drive yourself crazy. Instead, spend a bit of
  quality time with your idea—do some market research, hash out a model—then
  dive right in and put it to the test. If you truly believe in what you’re
  doing, you should feel comfortable to making the move and excited to get your
  idea out into the world. If it works, take the next step with confidence. If
  it doesn’t work, move on.


  3.  Eliminate risk. Or at the very least, calculate your risks. Put some money
  aside, schedule with buffer time, and ask for help, but most importantly: hire
  your weaknesses. Whether you like it or not, you can’t do everything, and it’s
  not enough just to get things done—they need to get done properly. Hire people
  to cover the bases that you can’t cover, and you’re less likely to encounter
  disasters along the way.

  ### Your Culture Is Your Brand, and You Are Your Culture


  > "If your culture also equals your brand, then in building an extraordinary
  culture, you will be automatically and organically building an extraordinary
  brand."- Daring & Disruptive, page 107


  As a leader, it is important to ensure that your culture is a reflection of
  your _why_. When hiring, consider the fact that skills and experience are
  teachable; passion and attitude are not. You as a leader need to remind the
  members of your team individually that they play a crucial part in carrying
  out the vision of the company. Even so, your employees should enthusiastically
  share your values.


  Your employees should also feel empowered, knowing that they make a
  significant contribution to the company. Empowerment equals proactive and
  positive thinking. It also promotes what Messenger refers to as
  _intrapreneurialism_: entrepreneurialism within a company. By investing the
  time and money into skill development and training, guiding your employees
  into the roles that they seek themselves as opposed to forcing them into the
  roles that you wish them to fill, they will find their own sense of purpose in
  the company and yield satisfying results, both personally and professionally.


  By supporting and appreciating the unique wants and needs of your staff, you
  are fostering loyalty, productivity, and engagement while building a culture
  that is united. At the same time, you must invest in yourself. You, too, need
  to face challenges, take new opportunities, learn, and grow. Your attitude,
  your health, and how you spend you time will affect you, affect your team, and
  therefore affect your brand.

  ### Disruptive Ideas and Your Why


  > "You must have an almost irrational self-belief that propels you forward,
  despite any chaos or failure around you."- Daring & Disruptive, page 4


  The best ideas are the ones that address a “pain point,” or a source of
  frustration within an industry. These “pain points” often represent a gap in
  the market. To be disruptive is to enter an existing industry through the back
  door and attack it’s pain point with innovative thinking, ultimately filling
  the gap.


  The trick is to get moving before you have all the answers. Disrupters look to
  outside industries for functional ideas that can be applied in new, disruptive
  ways. They don’t have a sense of what “can’t” be done in the industry they are
  disrupting—which means they can do it anyway, and do so in a constant state of
  change. They do not fear lack of knowledge or financial capacity. They dream
  big, envisioning the ideal result, and work back from there to make it happen,
  financially and otherwise.


  All of this is dependent on one thing: your _why_. The application of an idea
  begins by forging ahead fuelled with self-belief and with little to no
  external validation of your idea. Before anyone backs you, you need to back
  yourself; without a sense of purpose, it would be impossible to get off the
  ground. In Messenger’s case, her _why_ is to make a widespread positive
  change, “to make a vast difference in the lives of other people,” and to
  demonstrate that “anything is possible.” Her idea was _Collective Hub_, a
  publication that would fill the gap in the market by doing exactly that for
  entrepreneurs around the globe. As an entrepreneur with a strong sense of
  purpose, disruption would inevitably follow.

  the book for you. If you’re looking for something to inspire you, or give you

  mantras and messages.

  “If I’m going to fail, then I want to do it well – fast and with minimum risk.
  And as a result of this ethos, I’m quite prepared to try out a lot of new and
  interesting things, unafraid of the outcome.”

> “If I’m going to fail, then I want to do it well – fast and with minimum risk. And as a result of this ethos, I’m quite prepared to try out a lot of new and interesting things, unafraid of the outcome.” _\- Daring & Disruptive, page 76_

We all have fears, but what we don’t all realize is how strongly they can hold us back, especially when the one thing we need to be successful is confidence within ourselves. In _Daring & Disruptive_, Lisa Messenger recounts a number of stories that feature her own experiences of fear: from stage fright gone terribly bad, to having everything except for a bikini and her passport stolen from her in Rome, and then eventually, the terror of launching a magazine into eleven countries, successfully. She is open and honest about her best and worst moments in business, all the while maintaining that anything is possible.

A mix of Messenger’s personal stories and business advice, _Daring & Disruptive_ is an all-encompassing guide to eliminating the fear of failure as you pursue innovation and disruption. From believing in yourself to value exchange, Messenger touches on 10 actions to take in order to set the stage for positive failure leading ultimately to success. Messenger flies through these entrepreneurial challenges in less than 200 pages, connecting them all to the importance of strength, self-belief and finding your purpose.
