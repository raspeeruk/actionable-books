  ### Rules are to be broken


  > "You don’t have to follow the old rules. You can bend them, break them,
  ignore them."- Darling, You Can’t Do Both, page 10


  Kestin and Vonk wrote this book with the intention that it be a guide, a
  how-to, on breaking the rules in the work place that will allow women “to have
  a whole lot of both” of career and family. There are a dozen rules that the
  authors believe women should break:


  *   If you have a life, you’re not working hard enough.

  *   Gender bias is an issue of the past. Moving on, ladies.

  *   Mentoring is an act of charity. Good things come to those who wait.

  *   Nice girls don’t get in your face.

  *   Because you’re not worth it.

  *   I’ll do it myself, thanks.

  *   Darling, you can’t do both.

  *   Stay safe.

  *   Networking is for me.

  *   To win, you have to play the game.

  *   Ambition is a straight line to the top.


  Let’s take a closer look at two of these rules and why they should be broken.

  ### Network without an agenda


  > "The best way to network is to do it authentically, organically, to show up
  without an ‘agenda,’ to meet new people for the genuine pleasure of the human
  connection."- Darling, You Can’t Do Both, page 234


  The authors share that they believed networking wasn’t going to make any
  difference to their careers. In the early days they held to the adage that
  their work would speak for itself, that all they needed were results,
  creativity, and a work ethic that couldn’t be beat. They believed there was no
  need to network, that it was what insincere folks who lacked any real skill
  needed to do. But, what these talented women learned and want to share with us
  is that many women don’t understand the importance of networking and how to
  leverage it. It took being almost forced into attending a conference as a
  member of a panel of judges reviewing local ad agencies for it to occur to
  Nancy that “networking isn’t the tedious time-waster as I’d pegged it to be.”


  Many women do not even bother to attend any sort of networking event for
  reasons that often come back to the view that it isn’t worth their time and
  they see no immediate benefit, but even more so because they feel it is a
  schmooze fest on the golf course. This perception of phony interactions with
  the purpose of blatant, verging on obnoxious, self promotion is what gives
  networking a bad rap. So what? You shouldn’t succumb to that rule or
  stereotype; you should make a point of attending and network on your own
  terms.


  Attend. Even if you have to be dragged there, just attend. Then, once you are
  there, focus on meeting people for the pleasure of meeting people. Realize the
  point of networking is to develop long term relationships. It’s not about how
  many business cards you collect or hand out, “effective networking looks very
  little like the cliché that women find so off putting.” Rather it is a mutual
  giving/sharing/supporting relationship with focus on longevity.

  ### You are in the game, so you might as well play


  > "Yes, business is a game, but we believe women can redefine the rules…to
  play on our own terms."- Darling, You Can’t Do Both, page 254


  Rules like crazy work hours that no one should be made to feel like they must
  keep, or a culture where displaying emotion immediately gets you a fast track
  to the door as you must not be strong enough to make it in this environment,
  facilitate the exodus of many women out of the game of business because
  they’re not willing or interested in abiding by these rules of the game.


  As a participant in the game, you need to know the players on the team. Kestin
  and Vonk recommend that you do your homework and learn the lingo. It doesn’t
  even have to be sector specific, although that would be advantageous and
  smart; it is the language that your team members are speaking. An example is
  shared in the book of three women who decided to learn all they could about
  the game of baseball because that seemed to be what was the topic of
  discussion in the hallways and at lunch and they were never included. They
  knew nothing about this sport to start with but after their research they
  ended up winning the office baseball pool! Following this rather shocking
  event, they were included in different kinds of conversations. They had
  something to talk socially about; thus it created a relationship that hadn’t
  previously existed with the other team players. After all, the game is about
  relationships.


  To play the game you need to bring your best to the table. And to be your best
  means being true to who you are. Sometimes that means asking the questions you
  know need to be asked. Realizing this may not be well received, but that it
  may lead to you leaving a company is something you need to come to terms with.
  Kestin and Vonk suggest that to be the best in the game you need to do the
  right thing, the thing that might be the most difficult, but in your heart of
  hearts you know to be right. You don’t want to get to the end of a good run at
  a company and look back and feel you compromised yourself. The reward in
  taking this approach is that you will develop a reputation as a thoughtful,
  challenging colleague and as Pulitzer Prize-winning author Laurel Ulrich said
  “well-behaved women seldom make history.”
f_conclusion: >-
  I love the book’s subtitle: “And other noise to ignore on your way up.” It
  speaks to the confidence that women are on their way up in their careers.
  Ignoring the noise gives permission to professional women that it is ok, even
  a required strategy, to ignore some of the rules that were written for the
  workplace but not necessarily for women in the workplace. Just as the
  strikethrough the title implies, it isn’t true that you can’t have it all.

If you have ever seen a Dove commercial featuring real women and their real bodies, curves and all, you have seen the advertising work of Janet Kestin and Nancy Vonk.

In the mid 2000’s, as the Co-Chief Creative Officers of Ogilvy and Mather Toronto, it was their brain child to debunk the notion of stereotypical beauty by removing the photo retouching and doing away with the thin and tall stereotype of beauty. In doing so, Dove engaged women on the topic of beauty, confidence and strength and positioned themselves as a company who understood women with the intention of being the preferred brand of choice.

It is this type of bold, creative gumption that both women have tried to stay true to as they traversed successful jobs and life outside the office; especially navigating the worlds of motherhood and demanding careers. In fact, the title of this book, _Darling, You Can’t Do Both_, is a direct quote from Nancy’s then boss as he advised her that she shouldn’t have kids when she was in line for top job at her agency.
