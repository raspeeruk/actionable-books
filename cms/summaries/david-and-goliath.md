  ### Our Instinctive Reaction to Apparent Advantages and Disadvantages is Often
  Wrong


  > "He doesn't appreciate the power that can come in other forms as well – in
  breaking rules, and substituting speed and surprise for strength."- David and
  Goliath, page 13


  In a world that focuses on superlatives, biggest fastest richest being,
  apparently, the goal, it’s easy to lose track of all the times those things
  don’t matter.


  **The next great innovation is far more likely to come from a company we’ve
  never heard of than one we’re already buying from.** Spending a fortune to
  reduce class size in US schools isn’t helpful. “Three strikes” laws did
  absolutely nothing to deter crime.


  The advantages of power or size aren’t as obvious as they once seemed.


  On the other side of the coin, **a recent study at City University London
  found that 1/3 of successful entrepreneurs are dyslexic.** A review of major
  historical figures of the past 300 years reveals that 45% of those for whom
  data is available lost a parent before the age of 20.


  During WWII, Churchill’s greatest fear was that Germany would bomb London,
  causing panic and mayhem. It was his belief that sustained bombing by the
  Germans would lose the Allies the war. Instead, people who survived near
  misses gained confidence, some even refusing to evacuate when it was possible.


  **Our instinctive reactions to size, speed, intelligence, and other
  measurables is frequently wrong.** These things are often supplanted by things
  it’s harder to measure: grit, persistence, determination. Some of the
  anecdotes in the book remind us that when a person feels they’ve already lost
  everything, they’re willing to take risks the rest of us couldn’t conceive.


  And when they succeed, it’s a success we couldn’t conceive.

  ### Better to Be a Big Fish in a Small Pond


  > "Our sense of how deprived we are is relative. This is one of those
  observations that is both obvious and (upon exploration) deeply profound."-
  David and Goliath, page 79


  College students seek out the best school their money can buy. As a result,
  students used to being at the top of their class are now average – or even
  below average.


  As a result, these students drop out, change majors, or change schools far
  more often than lower ranked students who went to a university where they had
  less academic competition.


  Honduras is a poor country. By comparison, the average Chilean has 4 ½ times
  the purchasing power of a Honduran.


  When we compare the happiness of the poorest Hondurans to that of the poorest
  Chileans (who still have significantly greater purchasing power) the Hondurans
  are far happier.


  The poor in Chile don’t compare themselves to the poor in other countries, the
  compare themselves to the average Chilean. When they do, the gap is larger
  than when a Honduran makes the same comparison.


  Few of us compare our wealth to the famous rich or our creativity to leading
  artists. We compare ourselves to our peers. As a result, we may think we’re
  not doing so well when in fact we’re above average overall, just not within
  the small group we’re using for comparison.


  It goes the other way, too: we may think we’re a star, only to discover in
  another context that we’re simply the best among a small group of average
  performers.


  **For the sake of progress, we need challenging peers. For the sake of
  contentment, though, we should choose peers among whom we can shine.**


  Either choice should be deliberate, not unconscious.

  the benefits."- footnote quoting Barry Schwartz and Adam Grant, David and

  When I was a kid I built plastic models. Started with cars and trucks and
  quickly moved to the Wright Brothers’ plane, Sir Francis Drake’s Golden Hind,

  **Using model glue you learn that more is not better.** You need enough glue
  to make the parts stick, and not one bit more. More glue just melts the pieces
  and ruins them.


  Chefs know this well. Enough salt is necessary. Too much salt ruins the dish.


  Elsewhere in life we’re less aware of the inverted U: at first, more is
  better. After a while, the benefit levels off. Eventually, though, it crashes,
  become as bad as “not enough” or even worse.


  Being bigger than your enemy is good. Goliath was too big.


  It turns out that class sizes, alcohol consumption, wealth (in relation to
  parenting) and the punishment of crime all follow an inverted U. Up to a
  point, smaller classes, a drink, money, and punishment deliver a positive
  outcome. A bit more, and they stop having additional benefits.


  And then, they stop having benefits. Too much is as bad as too little.


  Balance is rarely touted in business, especially entrepreneurship. Yet all
  around us is evidence that after a certain point, “more” is less.

> "Why do we automatically assume that someone who is smaller or poorer or less skilled is necessarily at a disadvantage?" _\- David and Goliath, page 22_

The story of David and Goliath hardly needs introduction. Some of the details may be sketchy in your mind, though.

It’s those details which fundamentally alter what we take away from the account.

A few points from the historical account which might skew your natural assumption about who to bet on in a battle between an armed and armored giant trained for battle and an unassuming shepherd aimed with a strip of leather and a rock:

*   Goliath moved slowly. David was fast.
*   Goliath appears to have suffered poor vision. David’s seems to have been acute.
*   Goliath carried heavy weapons for close combat. David carried a ranged weapon capable of high accuracy at a great distance.
*   Goliath, as a trained soldier, had expectations about how the fight would proceed. David, an amateur, expected to use his skills and abilities in any way necessary to win.
*   Goliath was fighting a war. David was performing an act of worship.

Whether you believe God fought for David or not, when we consider the details, the outcome seems inevitable – and the opposite of what we expected on the surface.

As Goliath bellered his challenge to the Israelites, their greatest warriors assumed they would be fighting on his terms, the recognized and accepted norm for warfare in their day.

When you’re facing Goliath, the solution is often the opposite of obvious.

_What giant challenge are you facing which might succumb to a counter-intuitive approach?_
