  ### Prioritize your decisions and actions


  > "Once you’re better able to prioritize your decisions and your actions, the
  results that you are getting will improve. If you can move your life forward a
  little bit each week, you begin to feel balanced. You can start leading
  instead of just managing. Be the inspiration – for yourself and others. Be the
  person others look at and wonder, ‘How do I get my life to be like that?’ And
  then tell them how! Decide and commit to Gain, balance, prioritize, plan, and
  get energy from desire instead of from fear."- Decide, page 159


  We become leaders when we decide what we want out of life and make that a
  priority. As McClatchy points out, no one has ever become wildly successful
  just meeting someone else’s expectations. Meeting our own goals not only makes
  us feel more accomplished and balanced, but we also become an inspiration to
  others. The key is deciding to commit to our goals and consistently taking
  action to move our life forward a little bit at a time. Our decisions about
  priorities will bolster long-term perseverance.


  McClatchy says, “It sounds like people believe there is an inherent conflict
  between work and life! This is an unfortunate perspective, because we don’t
  have a separate professional and personal life; we have only a life.” This is
  important when we consider how to prioritize work with other goals. Just as
  there is not really a mind-body connection, they are both part of the same
  system. If we disconnected them, neither one would work. Personal goals and
  work goals need to harmonize.

  ### Create habits to support your goals


  > "Whatever you do, you know this is an important item – something that, if
  lost, will definitely cost you some time. So you make a decision to place your
  keys somewhere every night, and you don’t have to think about it after that.
  You created a habit."- Decide, page 128


  Like our keys, our goals and time are important. We create habits because they
  ensure we remember to do something that is important. Even habits we created
  with negative consequences filled a need. Now we are going to create habits
  that ensure we are making steady progress toward our goals. Worthwhile
  endeavors often take time. Without habits to keep us on track, it is easy to
  become distracted from our goals.


  We form habits when the consequence of not doing an action creates a loss. We
  form an emotional connection to the action that prevents the loss. The
  emotional connection causes us to repeat the activity. To make new habits
  stick, write down your goals. What would you lose if you do not reach them?
  Why are they important? Connect with the positive outcome of reaching your
  goal. Remember the benefits as you do the work to get there. Regular
  repetition is essential in creating habits, which is another reason to
  schedule your time.


  As McClatchy says, “We can’t really manage time itself. Time ticks on no
  matter what we decide to do with it. We can only manage our _decisions_.”
  Managing those decisions is what defines who we are. If we decide to spend all
  of our time on evanescent thrills and trivial, mundane tasks, we will never
  achieve enduring accomplishments and meaning in our life.

  ### Planning reduces stress and increases productivity


  > "Planning in advance allows you to be proactive, and… this keeps stress and
  urgency low, allows for better-quality work, keeps you in control, and allows
  you to decide the best time to complete a task before the deadline decides for
  you. When you don’t have a plan, productive work time will elude you until the
  last minute. You end up being reactive – which brings on high stress and
  urgency, lower-quality work, and less control and convenience."- Decide, page
  105


  When we know what we want, it’s time to create a plan. We can modify the plan
  as we go, but the plan tells us what is important. This is where we decide
  _when_ to spend time in our life pursuing what is important to us. This allows
  us to decide where other people’s priorities belong. The quality of our work
  increases and our stress decreases because we are in control. Our energy
  increases because we look forward to the time we have committed to pursuing
  our goals. We are working toward our highest value even if we need to commit
  most of our time to things that are not personally meaningful. This mindset
  creates Gain and enables us to establish our identity and unique contribution.


  If we decide to let others plan our valuable time, our stress increases
  because it creates an internal conflict. We do not have time to decide to
  pursue what is personally important. We are not motivated by our own desire so
  our sense of accomplishment diminishes. Our energy decreases and so does the
  quality of our work and our life. With less energy, getting only the
  essentials done takes all our time. We procrastinate more and feel less
  connected to our work. This mindset is difficult to change; once we have
  decided that our own desires are less important than other peoples’ we tend to
  stick with that assumption.
f_conclusion: >-
  As I read _Decide_, I wanted a magic formula that makes every endeavor
  instantly successful. I took on the difficult task of a career change.
  Navigating a new occupation is stepping into the unknown. It took longer than
  expected and there is more required than I knew. I had to take a second job
  and _give up_ time I wanted to spend on a new career (and other things) to
  earn enough while I get myself established. I felt like a failure and wanted
  to know where I went wrong. When I finished the book, I realized setbacks are
  part of life. The magic happens when we decide to do what it takes and
  continue to pursue worthwhile goals even when it turns out to be harder than
  expected.

  "Doing what we have to do each day to maintain our lives is management. This
  is not what defines us as individuals; rather, it is what makes us the same as
  everyone else. Personal leadership is doing what we don’t have to do to lead
  ourselves forward and grow each day. This is where we get our self-identity,
  and what differentiates us from others."

Have you ever felt you are not getting all you wanted from life? Perhaps all the work you do fills your time and meets your needs but does not add any value to your life. You feel like you are running in place instead of reaching goals. Steve McClatchy guides us through how to stop just Preventing Pain and start Gaining in _Decide_. He has taught his method to high school students, high-level executives and people at every level between. His formula works on all aspects of life from work and relationships to health and financial goals. He teaches us how to become leaders in our lives and define our unique contribution and ourselves.

We find the complete process for avoiding burnout, feeling like life is getting worse, and achieving what we want and feeling balanced in _Decide_. For this summary, I will focus on setting priorities that result in actions that reach goals.
