  ### We Are All Using a Flawed Decision-Making Process


  > "The pros-and-cons approach is familiar. It is commonsensical. And it is
  also profoundly flawed."- Decisive, page 8


  Humans are fundamentally irrational. We like to think our decisions are
  logical deductions based on empirical data, but this **ignores** large and
  powerful portions of our brains in which emotions overpower or undermine
  logic.


  This gives rise to **four villains** in our decision-making process:


  1\. **Narrow framing** – spotlighting one alternative at the expense of others
  available  

  2\. **Confirmation bias** – developing a belief about a situation, then
  seeking out information that bolsters our belief  

  3\. **Short-term emotion** – mental churn which obscures perspective  

  4\. **Overconfidence** about how the future will unfold – we cannot examine
  what we can’t see or know


  We may be irrational, but we’re _predictably_ irrational. Forewarned is
  forearmed: knowing the villains means we can **learn coping strategies.**

  ### Prepare to Be Wrong: Bookend the Future & Set a Tripwire


  > "In a letter to \[Beatles manager Brian\] Epstein, Dick Rowe, a prominent
  talent scout at Decca Records, wrote ‘We don’t like your boys’ sound. Groups
  are out; four-piece groups with guitars, particularly, are finished.’ As Dick
  Rowe would soon learn, the fourth villain of decision making is
  overconfidence. People think they know more than they do about how the future
  will unfold."- Decisive, page 17


  Let’s take a deep dive into the strategy for dealing with the fourth villain,
  overconfidence about how the future will unfold, by **preparing to be wrong**.


  Bookend the future. Likely outcomes fall in a range, not on a single point.
  Know the range and prepare for both extremes. **A wider target is easier to
  hit,** so if we imagine a worse (but realistic) lower end of the range and a
  better high end of the range, we’re even more likely to be prepared for any
  outcome. Hold **premortems:** imagine your decision leads to utter failure.
  What caused it? Prepare for those possibilities. Hold **pre-parades:** your
  decision leads to wild success. Will you be ready for what that means? Some
  outcomes can’t be predicted. Sometimes it makes sense to build in a **safety
  factor.** For instance, elevator cables are designed to withstand eleven times
  the elevator rating. Because the cost of failure is so high in this case, the
  safety factor is large, but a smaller multiplier can also be useful.


  Set a tripwire: If X happens, I will revisit the status quo and decide again.
  It’s natural to fall into **autopilot** mode, especially when change is
  **gradual**. Choosing a measurement, event, or **pattern of events** which
  prompts revisiting the decision can snap us awake. Knowing we have a tripwire
  in place allows us to **focus on the process** rather than continually
  fretting about the current status. Partition: set aside finite funds, time, or
  other assets, and before increasing the investment, revisit the decision. It’s
  human nature to escalate our investment in poor decisions to try to bend them
  to our will. When we’ve set a **cap** in advance (no more than X dollars, or X
  months will be spent) it prevents runaway cost and schedule overruns.

  ### WRAP: Strategies for Defeating the 4 Villains of Decision Making


  > "We can't deactivate our biases, but... we can counteract them with the
  right discipline."- Decisive, page 22


  As Daniel Kahneman shows repeatedly in [_Thinking Fast and
  Slow_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/),
  awareness of our irrationality doesn’t remove it, it only **allows us to
  compensate.**


  These coping strategies, properly applied, prevent us from being entirely at
  the mercy of our irrational unconscious when making decisions. Note the
  mnemonic acronym **WRAP.**


  1\. Narrow framing – **Widen your options** – Avoid a narrow frame by
  considering **opportunity costs.** Consider what you’d do if all your options
  went away. Be wary of **“whether or not”** single-choice decisions.
  **Multitrack**: consider more than one option simultaneously. Can you have
  “this AND that” rather than “this OR that”? **Find someone who’s solved your
  problem** and analyze their solution. Look at your own past solutions to
  similar choices.


  2\. Confirmation bias – **Reality-test your assumptions** – **Consider** the
  possibility of **the opposite** of your assumptions being true. Ask
  **disconfirming** questions. Look for empirical data which might
  **contradict** our assumptions. **Take baby steps:** small experiments to test
  various options.


  3\. Short-term emotion – **Attain distance before deciding** – Overcome
  short-term emotion. Consciously consider: how will I feel about this decision
  in **10 minutes? 10 days? 10 years?** What advice would I give **my best
  friend?** Honor your core priorities. **Agonizing decisions** are often a
  conflict between core priorities. Identify those priorities and resolution is
  easier, sometimes obvious.


  4\. Overconfidence about how the future will unfold – **Prepare to be wrong**
  – Bookend the future. Likely outcomes fall in **a range, not on a single
  point.** Know the range and prepare for both extremes. Set a **tripwire:** If
  X happens, I will revisit the status quo and decide again. Partition: set
  aside finite funds, time, or other assets, and before increasing the
  investment, revisit the decision.

  When **the greatest minds in science** have only recently accepted the
  predictable irrationality of the human mind, it can be easy to ignore the
  challenging claim that our decision-making process is fundamentally flawed.

  how to fight them (with something more potent than a list of pros and cons.)"

Good decisions in business and in life are the difference between **success and failure,** between happiness and misery.

With the stakes so high, wouldn’t you like to **be sure** of your decision-making process?

Let’s take a deep dive into the strategy for dealing with the fourth villain, overconfidence about how the future will unfold, by **preparing to be wrong**.

Bookend the future. Likely outcomes fall in a range, not on a single point. Know the range and prepare for both extremes. **A wider target is easier to hit,** so if we imagine a worse (but realistic) lower end of the range and a better high end of the range, we’re even more likely to be prepared for any outcome. Hold **premortems:** imagine your decision leads to utter failure. What caused it? Prepare for those possibilities. Hold **pre-parades:** your decision leads to wild success. Will you be ready for what that means? Some outcomes can’t be predicted. Sometimes it makes sense to build in a **safety factor.** For instance, elevator cables are designed to withstand eleven times the elevator rating. Because the cost of failure is so high in this case, the safety factor is large, but a smaller multiplier can also be useful.

Set a tripwire: If X happens, I will revisit the status quo and decide again. It’s natural to fall into **autopilot** mode, especially when change is **gradual**. Choosing a measurement, event, or **pattern of events** which prompts revisiting the decision can snap us awake. Knowing we have a tripwire in place allows us to **focus on the process** rather than continually fretting about the current status. Partition: set aside finite funds, time, or other assets, and before increasing the investment, revisit the decision. It’s human nature to escalate our investment in poor decisions to try to bend them to our will. When we’ve set a **cap** in advance (no more than X dollars, or X months will be spent) it prevents runaway cost and schedule overruns.

When **the greatest minds in science** have only recently accepted the predictable irrationality of the human mind, it can be easy to ignore the challenging claim that our decision-making process is fundamentally flawed.

Even if we don’t see the train, we still need to get off the tracks.

One weapon against the villains of decision making is to take baby steps; test small decisions to see which is the better direction.

**Where will you test the** WRAP **process in your life or business?**
