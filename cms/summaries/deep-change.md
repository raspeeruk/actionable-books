  ### Deep personal change precedes corporate change


  > "Deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of
  thinking and behaving. It is change that is major in scope, discontinuous with
  the past and generally irreversible."- Deep Change, page 3


  It would be a lie to say I enjoyed this book. It was a fine read, but the
  author called me out. He described how most people, like me, want to find
  small steps they can make that will result in major change. It doesn’t happen.
  It is like trying to cross a stream in three jumps. Unless you make the
  commitment to jump-all-the-way, you won’t change sides of the river.


  The nature of every change is inevitably personal. It is so obvious, yet
  missed so often. An organization of any kind—a family, church,
  business—doesn’t change if everyone keeps doing the same things. You do what
  you’ve always done, you get what you’ve always got!


  So someone must alter their behavior. The person who changes first is the
  leader. A leader is not someone who stands at a distance and tries to enforce
  changes on other people’s behavior. That isn’t the way change happens.


  The personal demand on the leader is the essence of deep change.

  ### Competence can close down change


  > "An individual contributor is a person whose technical competence is judged
  in terms of singular rather than interdependent action. The more unique the
  individual output, the more powerful the person becomes."- Deep Change, page
  115


  Citing baseball legend Ted Williams, the author claims, “Williams gets to be
  Williams because everyone wants to be who he is. Secretly, everyone wants to
  be so good at his job that he can tell his boss to go to hell and his boss has
  to take it. Everyone wants to be Ted Williams.”


  Oddly, one of the major barriers to change is someone who does their job well,
  so well the rest of the organization couldn’t get by without them. Because of
  this they have an inordinate amount of power and the organization can’t make
  the changes they need to make. One has only to look at the miserable 2014-2015
  record of Los Angeles Lakers and their relationship with Kobe Bryant for a
  contemporary illustration of this problem.


  Rather than evaluating people by their proficiency at job-related tasks, the
  author insists their job definition must include relating to other people. The
  effect each of us has on other people shapes our success or lack of it. Other
  relationships cannot be separated from bringing change.


  I mentioned the author made me uneasy. He called me out for expecting other
  people to change without changing myself. This should make any leader nervous.
  A leader must be captured by the change they champion so that they are willing
  to pay the price.


  The recent racial tensions in the United States remind me of the beauty of the
  leadership of Martin Luther King Jr. who not only articulated his dream, but
  who sat in a Birmingham jail, who committed himself to nonviolence. “I Have A
  Dream” would have stood alone as a great speech, but it catalyzed change
  because the leaders of the movement embodied the change themselves. They
  experienced _Deep Change_.


  As a pastor, I am weekly calling people to change their lives. Yet, it is the
  height of hypocrisy to ask them to make changes I am unwilling to make. That
  is why this book was hard for me to read.


  Every New Year’s resolution fails because people are unwilling to make the
  deep change necessary to follow through. There is no time like the present to
  think about the deep changes necessary to become the person you want to be, to
  have the family you want to have, to succeed at work like you want to.

  ### Improvement requires change


  > "Shifting from the current equilibrium or normal level of performance to a
  higher level means that a transformation must occur. At least one person must
  recognize that more is possible."- Deep Change, page 162


  As I mentioned above, nothing changes unless someone changes. We don’t wish
  ourselves into higher effectiveness unless we do something differently and
  change. We must become someone who thinks and acts differently than the
  ineffective person we were before.


  The author identifies four breakdowns in personal change. Early in the change
  process, _illusions_ lead us astray. We become idealistic. We expect things
  that aren’t realistic. Shortly thereafter we get derailed by _panic_. We
  think, _this will never work._ Then, on the verge of victory, a leader can
  experience _exhaustion_ and derail the change. Finally, as soon as some of the
  change becomes routine, we can relax into _stagnation_.


  At each one of those points in the process, a leader must change.

> "The land of excellence is safely guarded from unworthy intruders. At the gates stand two fearsome sentries – risk and learning. The keys to entrance are faith and courage." _\- Deep Change, page 165_

I did not get what I expected from _Deep Change_. “Discovering the Leader Within” sounds like a psychologized, self-absorbed look at leadership. Deep Change isn’t that.

_Deep Change_ is the acknowledgement that nothing changes unless people change. People don’t change unless a person, namely the leader, changes. An organization in need of change is an organized collection of people, each of whom need to change.

As I look back on my career, I have had a number of failures and a few successes. All the success had one thing in common – the primary leader embodied the change. Our church started a recovery program. I couldn’t have led it. I didn’t change. But the primary leader went down to neighborhood apartments that housed former inmates every Sunday morning and invited them to class. And, to everyone’s surprise, they came. Some of them stayed sober. They got jobs. They were reunited with their families. Because someone embraced the change first. Because one man experienced deep personal change our entire church experienced corporate change!

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Deep personal change precedes corporate change

> "Deep change differs from incremental change in that it requires new ways of thinking and behaving. It is change that is major in scope, discontinuous with the past and generally irreversible."- Deep Change, page 3

It would be a lie to say I enjoyed this book. It was a fine read, but the author called me out. He described how most people, like me, want to find small steps they can make that will result in major change. It doesn’t happen. It is like trying to cross a stream in three jumps.

The nature of every change is inevitably personal. It is so obvious, yet missed so often. An organization of any kind—a family, church, business—doesn’t change if everyone keeps doing the same things. You do what you’ve always done, you get what you’ve always got!

So someone must alter their behavior. The person who changes first is the leader. A leader is not someone who stands at a distance and tries to enforce changes on other people’s behavior. That isn’t the way change happens.

The personal demand on the leader is the essence of deep change.
