  ### Deep Work is Valuable in the New Economy


  > "In the new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those
  who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the
  best at what they do, and those with access to capital."- Deep Work, page 28


  Newport begins the book with examples of winners in the new economy, and
  describes the unique skill sets needed to succeed in today’s workplace. Of the
  three skills listed in the quote above, becoming the best at what you do is
  the key theme of his book. And the most efficient way to do that is by
  mastering the ability to do deep work, which he defines as “professional
  activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push
  your cognitive capabilities to their limit.”


  Two essential competencies that he believes are instrumental in being able to
  do deep work are: the ability to quickly master difficult things, and being
  able to produce at an elite level. Both of these skillsets require the ability
  to work for extended periods of time with full concentration. This is easier
  said than done, with all the social media and network tools available to us
  today. That is why it is so important to intentionally schedule deep work, and
  restrict social media for that period of time. Ritualizing deep work is a
  great place to start.

  ### Flex your Concentration Muscle


  > "The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained."-
  Deep Work, page 157


  According to Newport, the key to valuable deep work is to train your mental
  muscles to do it. This will improve your concentration abilities as well as
  decrease your “desire for distraction.”


  The first exercise tip suggested is to schedule internet use in advance. In
  other words, plan on focusing on work-related tasks without the use of the
  internet or email for predetermined times throughout the day. This will
  acclimate the brain to tolerate and accept focus without distraction or
  boredom. As you practice focusing for longer periods of time, it will get
  easier to resist the pull of checking email or surfing the internet.


  Newport also suggests something he refers to as productive meditation. He
  describes this as focusing your attention on a specific problem that’s
  troubling you while you’re doing a physical task such as walking, running, or
  showering. This is useful for strengthening your distraction-resisting muscles
  and sharpening your concentration.


  According to Newport, spending time in nature also builds concentration. He
  cites studies supporting this assertion and believes this “allows your
  directed attention resources time to rebuild.” The reason for this
  replenishment is that our brains can take a break when walking in a park or
  forest preserve because it does not have to navigate busy streets and crowds.
  If you’re a city dweller and not close to a park or forest preserve, listening
  to music or going for a run can have similar benefits to a stroll in the park.

  ### Ritualize Deep Work


  > "The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions
  and add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize the
  amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a
  state of unbroken concentration."- Deep Work, page 100


  Newport lists several ways one can add a deep work ritual to their schedule.
  The right ritual or method to incorporate deep work into one’s schedule
  depends on the individual and project. The first step is to decide where and
  for how long. Where will your deep work efforts be performed (office,
  conference room, library, etc.) and how long will you commit to doing deep
  work? It’s important to schedule a specific time, since willpower is a finite
  resource—you want to preserve your mental energy to focus on the deep work and
  not worry about scheduling conflicts.


  The next step in ritualizing deep work is to add some structure, and rules or
  metrics, to measure progress. If you are a writer, you may measure progress by
  writing a certain number of words, or a certain amount of time spent
  researching a particular problem. It‘s vital that these metrics be determined
  ahead of time so that you know what’s expected, and at what point you can
  stop. Clarity is key.


  The third and last step to adding a deep work ritual is to ensure that you
  have all the necessary tools needed for a successful deep work session.
  Examples provided are environmental factors, such as coffee, food, and any
  other raw material or supplies needed for the actual work. Newport urges that
  this support be “systematized so that you don’t waste mental energy figuring
  out what you need in the moment.“
f_conclusion: >-
  If you’re looking to replace the shallow task-filled days with more meaningful
  duties, this valuable book is a great hands-on guide. Create a plan and ritual
  to boost your concentration and go develop the deep work for your focused
  success.

  “The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the
  same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a
  consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of
  their working life, will thrive.”

> “The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.” _\- Deep Work, page 14_

According to a 2012 McKinsey study cited in the book, 60 percent of the average knowledge worker’s time is spent on email and internet searching. If you factor in meetings and other administrative tasks, that doesn’t leave much time for value-added work, which is what knowledge workers are hired to do. Newport makes a case for carving out time in our busy days to disconnect, concentrate, and make an effort at producing at our peak.

Cal Newport, a computer science professor at Georgetown University, has written several books, including [_So Good They Can’t Ignore You_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you), and is also the author of a [popular blog](http://calnewport.com/blog/). His latest book, _Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World,_ is a blueprint for developing the ability to focus in today’s hyper-connected society. Before reshuffling your schedule to add deep work rituals, it’s vital to realize the importance of doing deep and meaningful work.
