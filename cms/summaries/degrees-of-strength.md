  ### Choose Your Path Carefully


  > "You go in the direction of your focus."- Degrees of Strength, page 26


  While this is the third of three “Mind Factors” discussed in the book, it is
  the one that “cinches the deal” as Bernie (one of the characters in the book)
  puts it. Our minds are powerful things and we tend to “see” what is top of
  mind. For example: have you ever bought a new car – let’s say a yellow VW Bug
  – only to start seeing them everywhere, when before your purchase you would
  swear you never saw any yellow VW Bugs on the road?


  This principle holds true for our goals and objectives, too, and it’s where
  the other two mind factors come in. It’s important to acknowledge and leverage
  the three mind factors when assessing any situation:


  1\. You can only focus on one thought at a time (multi-tasking is a myth).  

  2\. You can’t avoid a “don’t” (as in “Don’t picture a pink elephant”.
  Gotcha!)  

  3\. You go in the direction of your focus (the self-fulfilling prophecy, I’ll
  never lose this weight).


  So what you might ask? How does that help me and my team reach our targets
  this quarter? Well consider this… what are you asking your team to focus on –
  problems or what’s working? Are you telling them what ‘not’ to do (don’t lose
  the sale) or what the real goal is (satisfy our customers and win their
  business)? Are you starting to see the mind shift you need to make?

  ### Forward Focused Questions


  > "The human mind can rarely resist a well-timed, well-phrased question. In
  other words, as soon as someone is asked a question, the mind becomes pointed
  in the direction of the focus presented."- Degrees of Strength, page 38


  Just as data can be interpreted positively or negatively, how questions are
  worded can dramatically shift our focus. Think about what you focus on as you
  read each of the following questions:


  *   Why are we always making these mistakes?

  *   What am I doing wrong?

  *   What do we need to do to improve?

  *   What can I do better?


  Hopefully by now you are recognizing the difference between degrees of
  weakness and degrees of strength thinking; problem focused vs. solution
  focused. Ross and Vannoy call the first two questions ‘backward focus
  questions’ and the last two questions ‘forward focus questions’.


  So, when facing a challenging situation at work or at home, consider asking
  the people involved forward focused questions:


  1\. What is going right? How can we do more of this?  

  2\. Are there things we are currently doing that we need to get better at to
  be more successful? How might we make that happen?  

  3\. What else can we do that we are not already doing to make progress in this
  area?


  You don’t have to wait for something to be going right to be optimistic and
  forward-focused. The authors believe that “Optimism is a function of our
  ability to see what seems to be in the way – and using Degrees of Strength to
  transform the obstacle into a lever.”

  ### "Just the facts, Ma'am" can make or break you


  > "It took me a while to learn that yes, she wanted the facts – but how those
  facts were interpreted and used was the leadership difference she was looking
  for."- Degrees of Strength, page 29


  Sgt. Joe Friday, a character in a TV Show called _Dragnet_ (the original
  series aired in the 1950’s, and was revived again from 1967-1970), was famous
  for telling potential witnesses “Just the facts, Ma’am. Just the facts.” And
  while it is important to utilize facts and data when making business
  decisions, Roberto (another character/teacher in the book) reminds us how
  facts are interpreted and used which makes a world of difference to how you
  lead teams to better outcomes:


  “I used to share facts from a degrees of weakness perspective, so everything
  was interpreted or understood with a destructive or limiting energy: ‘Here’s
  where we’re in trouble.’ ‘These are all the problems we have.’ ‘We’ll never
  have enough resources.’… When I discovered that you can take the same numbers,
  the same facts, and see and use them differently – well, it changed
  everything. I began speaking up with, ‘Here’s why we can close that gap.’
  ‘These are the conditions we must create to generate solutions.’ ‘Here are the
  options our resources currently provide us.’”


  This is more than just a Jedi mind trick of replacing negative talk with
  positive talk. With a degrees of strength approach you look for what IS
  working in a given situation, even when things are not progressing as far or
  as fast as you would like. Encouraging your team to first focus on what is
  going right and how to do more of it generates forward momentum and helps
  transition them into a problem-solving mindset instead of an ‘avoid the blame’
  game.


  Which leads us to our second GEM…
f_conclusion: >-
  The book illustrates Degrees of Strength thinking across a number of different
  leadership issues – accountability, change management, leadership, individual
  performance, agility – all which help you become more comfortable with how to
  apply the concepts in real life situations. It closes with an inspiring quote
  from Woodrow Wilson, and I for one, just love inspirational quotes. So if
  you’re wondering if _Degrees of Strength_ is worth your money and your time to
  read, consider this:
f_quote-2: >-
  "It all starts with this question: What difference would it make if your team
  – or your family – had no weaknesses? Seriously – no joke: How would you lead
  if every strength and quality you needed for those around you to perform at
  higher levels already existed within them?"

> "It all starts with this question: What difference would it make if your team – or your family – had no weaknesses? Seriously – no joke: How would you lead if every strength and quality you needed for those around you to perform at higher levels already existed within them?" _\- Degrees of Strength, page ix_

_Degrees of Strength_ by Craig W. Ross and Steven W. Vannoy is an easy to read “story” based on real life case studies that strive to convince readers like you and me to change our mindset so we can unleash the untapped potential of every person we interact with – whether at work, at home or at the gym! If we want to be effective leaders, we need to change how we look at and interact with people in order to help them deliver on their potential and move our organizations to extraordinary performance levels.

If you’re like me (a realistic optimist), you likely read that introductory quote and thought to yourself, “No weaknesses? That would be fabulous! We’d take the world by storm. Life would be amazing!” But – _and there’s always a’ but’, isn’t there? –_ let’s be honest, we all have weaknesses. What we need to do is figure out how to minimize them or work around them. It’s just the way it is.

As you read this book, you’ll learn why that thinking is not only inaccurate, but how it’s hampering your leadership efforts in both your work and personal contexts. The authors then outline a series of ‘mind shifts’ that will help us move from this “degrees of weakness” position to a degrees of strength perspective. And that’s where the magic begins!

_“You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world,_ **_and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand._**_”_
