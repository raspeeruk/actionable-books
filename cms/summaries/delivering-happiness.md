  ### Your Brand Is Your Culture


  > "Over time, as we focused more and more on culture, we ultimately came to
  the realization that a company’s culture and a company’s brand are really just
  two sides of the same coin. The brand is just a lagging indicator of a
  company’s culture."- Delivering Happiness, page 151


  If there’s one thing that really stood out from Hseih’s story it’s the
  importance of building the right culture in your organization. Your culture is
  what attracts great talent, your culture is what keeps employees together, and
  your culture is what guides your organization during times of difficulty.


  In Hseih’s first company, LinkExchange, there was a moment he describes where
  he felt like he had “lost” the culture of the company. Working there became
  painful and it was actually a very valuable experience which changed the way
  that he built up the Zappos culture.


  As part of their two-week on boarding experience, all new hires at Zappos
  spend time on the customer service line. It’s an opportunity for them to learn
  firsthand how Zappos treats their customers and the importance of branding
  through helpful customer service conversations.


  Every year, Zappos also releases a “Culture Book” which is a crowdsourced
  document that has employees share how they’ve embodied Zappos’ 10 Core Values.
  It’s so popular that even customers and suppliers join in on sharing their
  stories in the Culture Book.


  There are so many other examples that make Zappos’ culture unique. And this is
  what drives their business today. Anyone can sell shoes online. Zappos is a
  leader in this because they’ve created something other companies can’t
  replicate… a great culture.

  ### Keep The Long-Term View in Mind


  > "Anyone who wants to compete with us has to learn the same things, so
  problems are just mile markers. Each one we pass means we’ve gotten better…
  It’s hard…but if we weren’t doing something hard, then we’d have no business.
  The only reason we aren’t swamped by our competition is because what we do is
  hard, and we do it better than anyone else."- Delivering Happiness, page 173


  What stuck out to me about Hseih is how he didn’t build Zappos purely to make
  money. He built Zappos because he wanted to create an organization where
  employees love their work and customers love the experience of interacting
  with the company. Because of this shift in perspective, he and his team were
  able to focus on how to build a company for the long term.


  Zappos could have made the easier decision to keep their head office in San
  Francisco rather than move it to Las Vegas, or outsource their customer
  service team overseas to save money. But they didn’t because both decisions
  were core to what makes Zappos… Zappos.


  It all goes back to the importance of culture. It’s not easy to establish and
  nurture a culture that is supportive, open, and entrepreneurial. That part
  takes a lot of time and keeping the long-term view, in spite of the financial
  obstacles, is how Hseih and his team has made Zappos so successful.


  To me, building a great culture is about having solid core values that you
  live up to everyday. Core values that are clear and visible to the entire
  company so there’s no doubt in the employees’ minds what the mission is. It’s
  not easy to develop the right culture and it takes time. But in the 21st
  century workplace, there may not be a more important task for companies than
  culture building.


  What are some great organizational cultures you’ve been around? What made them
  special to you?

  ### Never Outsource Your Core Competency


  > "It was a valuable lesson. We learned that we should never outsource our
  core competency. As an e-commerce company, we should have considered
  warehousing to be our core competency from the beginning."- Delivering
  Happiness, page 119


  Early in the growth of Zappos, they decided to partner with a logistics
  company that would handle all of their shipping and returns. The logistics
  company was located closer to the UPS world hub in Kentucky and theoretically
  they would be able to handle and ship the shoes a lot faster.


  Unfortunately, that didn’t end up being the case. The warehouse that the
  logistics company ran was a disaster and shipments weren’t being sent out on
  time. Customer complaints piled up and severely hindered Zappos’ reputation.


  In a gutsy move, Hseih and his team decided to take back the logistics
  component of their business. In a very short amount of time, they traveled to
  Kentucky, purchased a warehouse, and setup their own logistics operation. It
  was a work in progress initially but within a few months they were back to
  meeting (and occasionally exceeding) delivery expectations again.


  To Zappos, logistics was and still is a critical part of their business. As an
  e-commerce company, getting the merchandise quickly and accurately to
  customers is critical. More importantly, this is a key part of the customer
  experience. If a customer gets the wrong shoe size or has to wait a few extra
  days for their shoes, it hurts their experience.


  Ensuring customer happiness and satisfaction was a critical strategy for
  Zappos and not having control over logistics hurt their ability to be _the
  best_ in customer service. In fact they made multiple modifications to their
  business (e.g. going from a drop-shipping company to an inventory-holding
  company) to ensure that they could deliver an exceptional customer experience.


  I’m sure it hurt their short-term profitability to make these changes but it
  was because they had a guiding core value that was helping them make these
  decisions. It’s a reminder to all to deliver the best customer service you
  possibly can.

  passionate employees and customers – will happen naturally on its own."

> "At Zappos, our belief is that if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff – like great customer service, or building a great long-term brand, or passionate employees and customers – will happen naturally on its own." _\- Delivering Happiness, page 152_

_Delivering Happiness_ is about the incredible journey of Zappos going from a small (almost bankrupt) online shoe store to a $2 billion business. With no proven market for online shoe sales at the time, Hseih and the Zappos team not only proved the e-commerce model for shoes but also built a company with a remarkable culture.

Hsieh’s stories are highly relatable and he openly shares the lowest and highest points of his journey. It’s a book that has convinced me that there is nothing more important than developing the right culture within an organization and how there are no shortcuts when you care about doing the right things.

This summary alone won’t do this book justice. If you believe in the importance of building the right culture, pick up the book and study it. It might just change the way you do business.
