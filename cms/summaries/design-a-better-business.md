  ### The Design Mindset is the Best Mindset for Today’s Businesses


  > "The new, smarter way of working is that of a designer."- Design a Better
  Business, page 251


  The primary thesis of the book is that Design thinking allows for a quicker,
  broader, more client-centric view of business problems. This leads to better
  solutions, delivered more nimbly. The book offers many examples of where this
  has been proven true.


  The design mindset brings to business management a level of discipline and
  process to various business management activities. Consider the example of
  declining sales of your lead product. Using the Design Mindset, you would
  discuss with clients why they aren’t buying any more. You would also talk to
  competitor clients to find out what is more appealing about their product. At
  some point you have sufficient client data, so you go back and begin designing
  product changes that you feel will better meet client needs. You use
  prototypes to begin validating that your design changes meet client
  expectations. You might ‘pivot’ through several iterations of your design
  prototypes until you’ve reached a design that meets the client criteria. Lots
  of design thought processes go into getting this far. Even more are used to
  evaluate if your business is really ready to produce the evolved product. You
  will look at scaling of manufacturing, logistics, geographic regions, and
  other factors. You will look at willingness to make the change: is leadership
  aligned, is funding in place, what about collateral materials? With a design
  mindset, this is the way businesses can quickly and effectively respond to
  either internal pressures demanding change.


  The book goes so far as to propose that in the future, an MBA should be
  defined as a Master of Business Ambiguity and that Design Thinking is how the
  ambiguity will be dealt with (Page 232). There is even an MBA in Design
  Strategy being offered at the California College of the Arts. The mix of Art
  and Design is believed by the authors to provide an ideal mix of disciplines
  to give business executives the right mindset to succeed in a world of
  ambiguity and accelerated pace of change.

  ### Your Customer Will Tell you What to Design—If you are Willing to Listen


  > "Assuming you know your customers is really dangerous. Get out of the
  building and find out what their needs are. You won’t be sorry you did!"-
  Design a Better Business, page 85


  Most people have heard the old adage that ‘the customer is always right.’
  Barring a few words of caution, this adage very frequently proves to be true.
  The words of caution are that the client doesn’t always know how to articulate
  what they need. The designer needs to not just ask clients, but to observe
  them in order to get from them what is right.


  Assumptions that aren’t validated are always dangerous, especially in
  business. Anything you think you know about your client is, at best,
  historical information; at worst, inaccurate.


  Knowing your client, really knowing them, requires much more than assumptions.
  Knowing your client requires active interaction and continuous revalidation of
  what you believe you know about them. This book provides great insights into
  how to understand your clients. The authors assert that as a designer, you
  must get out of your office and see the client doing what they do. Observe
  them from a distance, watch for unique or common behaviours. Try to capture
  these observations so you can review them as often as needed. Interact with
  clients; ask questions about their unique or common behaviours. Ask why the
  client is doing the things you are observing. Validate what the client tells
  you through more observations. Remember that the client may not be able to
  articulate their needs: designers need to dig deeper than initial answers in
  order to help the client reveal their underlying need.


  Knowing your client is also about showing them what you have understood about
  their need. Get prototypes in front of clients early and often in order for
  them to help you understand what is right and what is wrong about your
  understanding of the clients need and your proposed solution.

  ### Design is Iterative


  > "It is one thing to generate, share, and expand upon lots of ideas. But
  you’ll need to explore some of those ideas in greater depth…"- Design a Better
  Business, page 158


  Creating design based solutions is about a lot of creative thinking early on,
  then iteratively narrowing the possible solution space to something that will
  answer the identified need.


  Iteration is a process of refinement: a process of continual improvement of a
  solution. Iteration takes into account changing understanding of needs and the
  business environment with each cycle through the design / delivery process.
  The iterative process is ideal for design work as design is all about
  narrowing in on the best solution from a multitude of possible options.
  Iterations allow designers to continually refine solutions while considering
  additional information about the need being solved for. Both Design Thinking
  and the Iterative process focus on getting prototypes in front of clients
  early and often, in order to validate and refine the solution. Design is
  iterative: it has to be in order to be successful. Iterative design gets a
  business to a right solution quickly while ensuring maximum value to the
  client.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Design a Better Business_ is a uniquely useful book for business executives
  looking to adapt to a world where ambiguity and increasing change of pace are
  the norm. This book combines Design tools and processes, case studies, and the
  rationale for applying Design Thinking to business. All you need to get
  started on designing a better business is in this book. All you need to do is
  read the book and take the leap.

> “This book will provide you with new tools, skills, and a mindset to harness new opportunities…” _\- Design a Better Business, page 9_

Created by many of the same contributors that brought you the book _Business Model Generation_, Patrick van der Pijl _et al_ expand upon their design concept for business, showing how businesses should be planned and executed using design principles.

In this concept filled book, the authors share the practical use of design tools for the various stages of business, product, or service design. Tools include:

*   Screenplays,
*   Team Charters,
*   Vision Canvas,
*   Storytelling Canvas,
*   Customer Journey Canvas,
*   Value Proposition Canvas,
*   Context Canvas,
*   Business Model Canvas,
*   Many others.

The book is not just a set of tools, though. This book includes a detailed process, the figure 8 model for executing in a logical order, the steps required to utilize the tools provided to effectively apply design principles to business design. The book also provides many examples of the tools and process employed in real-life case studies.
