  ### Innovative Solutions Are Created from Both Art and Science


  > "Design thinking is the search for the magical balance between business and
  art; structure and chaos; intuition and logic; concept and execution;
  playfulness and formality; and control and empowerment."- Design Thinking for
  Strategic Innovation, page 33


  Design thinking is a framework for a human-centered approach to strategic
  innovation and a new management paradigm for value creation in a world of
  radical change. This practice is both an art and science that focuses on
  forms, relationships, behaviors, real human interaction and emotion to
  approach problem solving in a way that results in creative solutions. Creative
  solutions are absolutely necessary to develop organizations and products that
  are relevant and valuable in a paradigm shift rapidly accelerated by
  technology innovation. With an action-oriented and forward looking approach,
  design thinking can also influence culture and empathy within an organization.
  This collective engagement and momentum toward growth can also have an impact
  in setting apart the winners from the laggards in any business industry.

  ### Effective Response to Change isn’t Reactionary. It Anticipates.


  > "A plan is needed – not just as a reaction to change, but also in
  anticipation of it."- Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation, page 111


  Sense making is an agile and adaptive practice in design thinking that employs
  techniques to identify, collect, question, and interpret the meaning of
  increasingly complex situations. This enables forward thinking toward
  opportunities for growth and in anticipation of change. This practice favors
  qualitative customer, culture, and people-centered inquiry. It looks toward
  possibility thinking rather than data and measurement of what has already been
  done. Through sense making, organizations can uncover internal structure or
  process issues, challenge assumptions and conditions at their cause, and
  recognize patterns and outliers in markets that signal change prior to
  emerging as a sizable shift. This predictive signal identifying practice gives
  organizations a better sense of timing to redesign and launch new products—a
  critical factor in innovation.


  To get started sense making, collect the real data. In order to understand the
  holistic experience with your company, consider a robust set of inputs—not
  just business performance data but also deep customer insights—social media
  conversational platforms, competitive analysis. Think soft and hard sensors.

  ### Business Today is About Disruption and Responding to Change


  > "Companies find themselves in a crisis because they can’t respond to change,
  even if they recognize the need for transformation. This is the age of extreme
  competition and every competitive advantage has been reduced to comparative
  advantage."- Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation, page 56


  Responding to change means responding to the forces creating market disruption
  and responding to customers’ evolving needs. Mootee says significant loss of
  shareholder value in many companies over the last ten years has been onset by
  “mismanagement, poor strategic decision making, and inability to react to
  disruptive innovation or extreme competition.” The design thinking solution to
  extreme competition is to differentiate in a relevant way through experience
  design – creating meaningful context and interaction between customers and
  products, services, systems, and spaces. Purposeful experience design
  communicates and reinforces a brand’s value proposition by relating
  functional, social, cultural, and personal relevancy to customers. For
  example, creating an online property for customers that enhances learning and
  mastery in a brand relevant topic space builds a bridge between affinity
  triggers that are rational and emotional.


  Here is one way to get started with experience design: Determine a starting
  point for creating experience with customers – an experience should have a
  clear beginning and end. It can be the scope of interaction in a physical
  store, marketing, or beyond. Think of where and why you engage with customers.
f_conclusion: >-
  Idris Mootee’s _Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation_ is an actionable
  resource for leaders of organizations in uncertain markets, facing new and
  emerging challenges. This is an accessible primer for new design thinking
  practitioners while providing novel insight for the experienced set. Mootee
  ends his work in a call for a new value system and a new paradigm in business,
  suggesting this shift has the promising potential not only to transform
  organizations but capitalism itself. That design thinking can “unleash our
  imagination of a better future.”

> "Every future business leader needs to be a good design thinker" _\- Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation, page 60_

In an increasingly complex world with multiple disruptive market forces – technological, regulatory, competitive – business as usual is not enough. Organizations in nearly any industry today are facing challenges to innovation and competitive advantage. In this environment, the inability to adapt and break out of the status quo will lock companies out of successful growth. Idris Mootee, author of _Design Thinking for Strategic Innovation: What They Didn’t Teach You in Business or Design School_, says, “It is the habits of mind and strategy that often prevent today’s dominant firms from reinvention.” This book makes the case for design thinking as a core growth engine for innovation and a practice to redefine solutions to the biggest challenges leaders face today. Mootee provides a design thinking approach to solve challenges in growth, predictability, change, relevance, extreme competition, standardization, creative culture, strategy, and organization.
