  ### Forget Motivation


  > "Motivation is not going to strike you like lightning. And motivation is not
  something that someone else – nurse, doctor, family member – can bestow or
  force on you. The whole idea of motivation is a trap. Forget motivation. Just
  do it. Exercise, lose weight, test your blood sugar, or whatever."- American
  Medical Journal, as quoted in Developing the Leader Within You, page 110


  Strong leaders understand this: if you want to create change in this world,
  change that benefits you and/or those you care about, you don’t wait for
  motivation – you create it. Too many people spend their days waiting and
  hoping for motivation to fill them with a fervour that allows them to commit
  to their cause. Motivation doesn’t do that. Motivation doesn’t come from the
  outside. Sure, inspiration can come from a motivational speech. No doubt you
  have heard a fantastic speaker at some point, left the room feeling like you
  were going to change the world, then a week later was back to life as usual.
  Motivation doesn’t come from someone’s words, no matter how impactful.
  Motivation does, however, share this fascinating and reciprocal relationship
  with “Action”.

  ### Be Different


  > "True leaders are always in the minority because they are thinking ahead of
  the majority."- Developing the Leader Within You, page 152


  I believe one major reason why people hesitate in stepping into the leadership
  role on a cause they care about is because they feel alienated in doing so.
  They start to doubt themselves. They think, “Well, people don’t support this
  idea yet, so maybe it’s not a good idea”. The fact is that every new idea
  starts with the minority. There is nothing in this world that everyone thought
  of at the same time, and then simultaneously dedicated all their efforts to
  realizing. For every idea that seems to have “sprung into the world” fully
  formed and fully supported, there is a small group of dedicated individuals
  who have been toiling for years. If you want to lead change, you should know
  up front that you will get strange looks, skeptics and those who shake their
  heads because they can’t see your vision. However – here’s the good news –
  tthere are others like you. There are other leaders out there who are also
  living on the fringes with their ideas. And every successful leader has gone
  through exactly the same thing. In fact, the more radical the change, the more
  isolated they felt and the longer they felt that way. Take confidence in your
  idea – share it with a small group of like-minded thinkers and pursue it with
  everything you’ve got.

  ### Take Action


  > "‘Motivation,’ says John Bruner, ‘is like love and happiness. It’s a
  by-product. When you’re actively engaged in doing something, the motivation to
  keep on doing it sneaks up and zaps you when you least expect it.’"-
  Developing the Leader Within You, page 111


  The reason JFK was able to rally the United States of America to the idea of
  landing on the moon by the end of the 1969 was because he was willing to act.
  He dedicated all the resources he could muster, kept the public abreast of
  progress and showed a genuine and personal interest in the mission’s success.
  Motivation – both your own internal motivation and the motivation of those
  around you – comes from action. Only through your actions can you expect to
  build “motivation momentum”.


  What action could you take today in regards to a goal you have? (I.e. Losing
  weight, quit smoking, increase sales by X%, build an orphanage, etc.) It
  doesn’t matter the size or scope of the goal – the first step to rallying
  people to the cause is taking action. People respect it, and you’ll motivate
  yourself by knowing you’re one step closer (no matter how small the step) to
  accomplishing your goal.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Developing the Leader Within You_ is a book about honing your own leadership
  skills. It’s written under the firm conviction that “if you build it (i.e.
  develop yourself into a leader), they will come.”

The ability to motivate others into action is a huge factor in leadership. All the great leaders have it – it’s the rousing speeches we remember; whether it was Martin Luther King Jr.’s “mission for equality”, JFK’s “man on the moon” or Churchill’s unrelenting attitude in WWII – there are speeches that took peoples’ “impossible” and gave them a breath of hope. Great leaders have the ability to take seemingly insurmountable tasks, make them seem probable and in doing so create action amongst their followers. What is it these people (and other leaders of their ilk) have that draws us to them? Why do we feel so inspired and inclined to take action for that leader’s cause?

Charisma plays a role, obviously. Charisma without passion is sleazy, though. While charisma’s important, if followers don’t believe in the conviction of their leader, then that person won’t be in a leadership position for long.

I want you to follow this logic with me:

1.  Growth inherently requires change.
2.  Change is new (again, by definition).
3.  Newness creates uncertainty in people, and they look to someone on whom to model their thoughts, actions and behaviours.
4.  The best person upon which to model their thoughts, actions and behaviours is someone who is already being and doing that which they want to be and do.

So let’s move from the follower mindset to leader mindset. Let’s assume you want to inspire, motivate and lead people in a cause you care about. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow said it best:

_“We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.”_

As quoted in _Developing the Leader Within You_, page 132

_“Follower finds the leader and then the vision. Leaders find the vision and then the people.”_

Find your vision. Have the conviction and the confidence to start – today. Take the first step towards improvement. “Be the change you want to see in the world,” as Gandhi said. Take the first step, stick to the cause and watch as people flock to your mission. We need more leaders – what’s stopping you?
