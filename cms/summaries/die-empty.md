  ### Overcome the Demons


  > "…those who are resilient and bounce back to fight another day recognize
  that nonfatal failure provides an opportunity to become more self-aware, and
  to reassess their strategy."- Die Empty, page 102


  It seems so easy – _it’s just in your head!_ – but many of the themes in
  Henry’s book focus on keeping the vast range of possible mind games and bad
  habits out of your way. Are you “busily bored” and working hard on mindless
  pursuits? Are you afraid to stretch beyond your comfort zone? Are you working
  a step removed from your dream role rather than diving right in, like being an
  editor instead of a writer? Henry helps you get real with what’s getting in
  your way.


  Being unwilling to settle for average is key to moving beyond these demons,
  and there are a number of reasons why you might get stuck. Let’s talk more
  about how to do this.

  ### Don't Settle for Mediocrity


  > "Individuals must make a personal commitment to lifelong personal innovation
  through skill development, risk-taking, and experimentation in order to avoid
  stagnation."- Die Empty, page 37


  Mediocrity is the bane of creative work, but can come disguised in many forms.
  You may have a “tried and true” blog formula that gets you desirable hit rates
  but doesn’t provide a format for digging into topics that matter more.


  Henry defines his “7 Deadly Sins of Mediocrity”, which include:


  **Aimlessness** – lack of direction


  **Boredom –** lack of passion


  **Comfort** – lack of willingness to “disrupt” or change


  **Delusion** – lack of self-awareness


  **Ego** – lack of a reality check


  **Fear** – lack of courage


  **Guardedness** – lack of nurturing relationships


  These can work in combination as well. Take the “Drifter” profile mentioned
  earlier, and add in boredom and comfort, and it is easy to see how you will
  struggle to achieve your goals. Use new awareness of the elements that best
  apply to you, and you’ll quickly figure out what is needed to get you on a new
  path.


  What was interesting too was how Henry’s concepts can be applied in a team
  setting, particularly for teams who require creativity. Incorporating elements
  from the book, particularly about recognizing if complacency is creeping in,
  can help define new levels of growth and success in your organization.

  ### Busywork Won't Produce Your Masterpiece


  > "Empty space wants to be filled, and where there is an absence of purposeful
  activity and meaningful progress, any activity that brings the ping of
  immediate productivity will fill the void."- Die Empty, page 19


  Mindless busywork fills valuable time needed for your best work. Early in the
  book, Henry defines the three kinds of work that will get you working at your
  fullest capability:


  **Mapping** – this is “the work before the work”, setting the goals and plans
  for achieving your objectives.


  **Making** – this is “doing the work” itself and delivering “the most tangible
  value”.


  **Meshing** – this is “the work between the work”, where nurturing your
  growth, building your skills, and being curious about new ideas will help you
  expand your thinking for new work ahead.


  What’s important here is to understand that all three elements are needed. As
  Henry states, Making + Meshing without Mapping means you’ll be a “Drifter”,
  unclear as to where you’re headed with your work. Similarly, Meshing + Mapping
  without Making means you’re a “Dreamer” and unable to execute. The goal is to
  be a Developer, where all three elements are working together in tandem to
  create the greatest value. Awareness of where you fall short (e.g., Henry
  mentions his tendency towards “drifting”) can help you refocus your efforts to
  get the outcomes you seek.
f_conclusion: >-
  I find Henry’s work compelling – I inhaled both of his books in a matter of
  days – and _Die Empty_ arrived at a time when I have been working to refocus
  on my own creative pursuits. I am not surprised that it has made Amazon’s Top
  10 list for 2013 and it is definitely in mine. Creativity is a key element to
  success in the 21st century and you need to nurture your creative and
  innovative side, or risk being left behind.

> "Tomorrow is only an unfilled wish, so live and work as if today is all you have." _\- Die Empty, page 215_

If today becomes your last day alive, would you be happy with what you’ve accomplished? Has that book “you’ve always wanted to write” been written? Did you use your photography skills to launch your first show? Have you built the prototype for the invention you know could change the world?

If your answer is “no, not yet”, Todd Henry’s book _Die Empty_ will help propel you forward towards achieving the projects or dreams still trapped inside you. Working each day to produce your best work means your masterpiece won’t go with you to your grave. Far from gloomy, the idea of dying empty creates a compelling visual for why working hard towards producing your best work has to start today. It starts now, and who else but you can do it?

_“You possess a one-of-a-kind combination of passions, skills and experiences; there is something you bring to your work that no one else could.”_

Henry is passionate about helping each of us create the work we only still dream of producing, and with creativity becoming an increasingly needed skill, his tools can develop the competitive advantage you need.

How do we take the first step to greatness?

The book tackles all of the elements that can get in your way, so the only thing left is to figure out what you want to produce. You, with your marvelous uniqueness and incredible abilities, are the only person who can create your masterpiece. Don’t let anything, least of all mind games, keep you from pursuing the work you have dreamed of creating.

With the urgency that “dying empty” creates, explore new avenues, disrupt the regular patterns in your work and begin to look at ensuring that your best work is what you produce each and every day.

_What works for you? How are you working to create your masterpiece so you can “die empty”?_
