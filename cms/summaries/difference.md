  ### Be the best


  > "You must do what it takes not to just be another creative or professional,
  but to be the creative or professional that people who want the particular
  must have"- Difference, page 77


  Set out to be the best at whatever it is you’re going to be. Don’t set out to
  be okay, or an alternate service that is slightly cheaper or just alright. Be
  the best. Figure out who you want to help, and what you can do to ease their
  pain. Be the one everyone who cares about your particular thing must have.
  This is hard. This is also great advice.


  In February, I opened an [Etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/mrstwigg) to
  sell vintage clothes because I enjoy thrifting and have excellent thrifting
  luck. I also enjoy sharing my finds with people, and celebrating that I found
  an object they will cherish in their lives. Etsy is filled with really great
  vintage sellers who have been around for a long time. If I am going to make a
  real go at this Etsy business, I need to be the best for the people I serve.
  Still working on how to do that…but it’s helpful to have a “be the best”
  mandate instead of a “slash the prices and copy everyone else” attitude.

  ### Different, not quirky


  > "Today the shortcut to more is to matter – not to be different, but to do
  something that creates difference. It isn’t the person with the best ideas who
  wins; it’s the person who has the greatest understanding of what really
  matters to people."- Difference, page 6


  This is scary and challenging, and also so beautiful. If in creating new
  products and services for people our biggest concern is understanding and
  improving things for other people – what a gorgeous world we could have. I was
  recently at a retirement party for a colleague and many of his external
  clients attended to celebrate his career. Everyone who spoke about him talked
  about how he had a “through the eyes of the client perspective”. He was known
  for interrupting fantastic internal planning sessions to ensure the client and
  their needs were being represented and respected. It made him and his clients
  successful. He always had their needs in mind. It was not about putting on a
  big show, or being flashier than the competition, it was about making a
  difference.

  ### Promises, not features


  > "Because people don’t want to do; they want to be. They want to be less busy
  and more productive, less alone and more connected, less fearful and more
  safe"- Difference, page 28


  So much time has been spent explaining to people the features of services and
  products but that is speaking to a rational buyer mind. People really want to
  know what is underneath the product or service, what could potentially change
  for them by using it. Spend more time thinking about what promises you can
  make, and less what the obvious features are. You need to “stand in a
  potential user’s shoes and understand the impact that an innovation and its
  design might have on that person’s life (and thus in the market)”.
f_conclusion: >-
  Bernadette Jiwa’s book is slim at just 79 pages, but it is full of such deep
  and important questions. The book features samples of successful companies’
  difference maps and how they answered some of the questions she asks
  throughout the book. It is a fantastic resource for people and organizations
  interested in success and making a difference.

  matter to the people you want to serve. You can’t build a great business just

In _Difference: The One-page Method for Reimagining Your Business and Reinventing Your Marketing_, Bernadette Jiwa generously offers her well developed, yet simply accessible model for people to reimagine their businesses and reinvent their marketing to show their difference. She researched successful brands and shares a wealth of questions to ask about the difference an organization could make for their target clients, and how to unlock stories that matter.

_Thinking about the people you serve (or would like to serve) can you identify one thing you or your company could be doing to make a difference in their lives? What would it be?_
