  ### Attention and Trust—Very Little Else Matters


  > "Organizations that align their total focus around optimizing their
  departments to provide the most seamless experience at each touch point in the
  journey will take home the lion's share of all rewards in the coming decade."-
  Digital Sense, Kindle Locations 1030-1032


  Attention and trust are the currency which is the most difficult to attain and
  retain, yet the most valuable assets to an organization.


  While some organizations still grapple with this in the traditional marketing
  capacity, adding the digital DNA into the mix makes it seem nearly impossible.
  To overcome this exponential explosion of changes, marketers and leaders must
  begin with a much deeper understanding of their customers and engagement with
  the brand.


  Within your own organization, the authors discuss the four generic archetypes
  to better understand motivations and how to, if possible, unlock the potential
  of greater digital sense:


  1.  **Influencers (I)** – Leaders, masters of human persuasion.

  2.  **Amplifiers (A)** – Direct subordinates to influencers driving vision
  into a tangible reality.

  3.  **Motivatables (M)** – Comfortable. 60% of the total populus. Wired to
  adapt and blend in.

  4.  **Zombies (Z)** – Unmotivatable and drive to create other zombies.


  Understanding your organization’s people is just as important as their
  engagement with the marketplace. Culture is a commonly and slightly overused
  word in business today. Yet data and customer-driven culture still serves as
  the most accurate focuses needed to improve attention and trust in the market.
  Gaining and understanding of what types of people make up your team will help
  you identify people who can drive and support change, as you adopt a more
  digital mindset.

  ### Relationships Matters, B.R.O.


  > "It's all about who you know, what you know, and who knows that you know
  what you know."- Digital Sense, Kindle Locations 4676-4677


  Social connectivity provides a unique and rapid fire way to develop
  relationships outside of traditional circles. Wright dives into a story where
  he recognized that personal and professional growth meant sharing wisdom and
  knowledge on a larger scale. Business Relationship Optimization (BRO), as he
  has coined the term, relates to building a personal and business brand which
  hones in on a more methodical approach toward expanding and deepening
  relationships.


  Wright shares an epiphany: “It’s all about who you know, what you know, and
  who knows that you know what you know.” In this journey of building his
  network, he begins the BRO process by determining to to get to know and list
  ways to add value to them. As relationships are likened to bank accounts,
  begin by making deposits with your network: engage on social media, share,
  help make connections/introductions, and offer solutions. On occasion, you
  would make a withdrawal, and like a FICO score, good credit(-ability) builds
  over time. However, be careful not to end up severely overdrawn, as then the
  relationship is over. Building more good credit opens more opportunities.


  Return on investment is dictated by your engagement at the right time with the
  right information to generate a return on influence.


  What results is a greater sense of purpose which turns into an energy that
  resonates both in-person and digitally.

  ### Social Business Strategy Applies Everywhere!


  > "Customer Experience is the battleground we all compete on in a digital
  world, and where customer service historically takes a well-honed ‘common
  sense,’ customer experience requires a well-honed digital sense."- Digital
  Sense, Kindle Locations 1290-1292


  As the authors take us deeper into the EMF (Experience Marketing Framework),
  we learn that social strategies are not simply limited to marketing any more.
  It is a cohesive organizational effort.


  Social Business for \_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank with one of the areas
  below):


  *   **Marketing:** Campaign, Content and Outreach

  *   **Sales:** Social Selling, Account-Based Marketing (ABM)

  *   **Influencers and Advocates:** Discover, Connect, Engage, Recruit &
  Measure

  *   **HR:** Recruiting, Culture, Hunting, Advertising

  *   **Customer Service (or Success):** Best Practices, Education,
  Administration, Governance, Policies, Executive Buy-in  
      

  Specifically, sales can benefit by transitioning to the digital conversation
  by extending the relationship via social media. “Social selling” allows
  salespeople to better construct more relevant dialogue through leveraging the
  wealth of information about prospects, companies’ activities, and trends in
  social media. Also, by listening, sharing, and sales can engage sooner where
  the buyers are researching. The author describes some basic steps:


  1.  Create or polish your Twitter/LinkedIn profiles

  2.  Connect with everyone in the company

  3.  Join 10-15 LinkedIn groups

  4.  Ask for recommendations

  5.  Interact once a day
f_conclusion: >-
  According to the authors, 70% of learning happens at work, 20% via mentoring,
  and 10% in classroom settings. This means that learning equals doing and the
  status quo will remain if you don’t change the conditions. Travis and Chris
  want to remind us that even in a digital capacity, we are still humans
  interacting with humans (H2H). Acting with this kind of digital sense,
  customers will reward organizations who engage with them over social media by
  spending 20-40% more money with those companies than other customers. That’s
  material enough to start making a change today.

> "A digital marketer is someone who understands that, to engage someone digitally, it must be done in a meaningful, personalized and contextually + culturally relevant manner." _\- Brian Solis, Digital Sense, Kindle Locations 421-422_

Travis Wright, CCP Global and Chris J. Snook, Columnist and Serial Entrepreneur, provide a common ‘digital’ sense playbook on how organizations need to act in the modern consumer, data-driven era. They remind the readers that technology amplifies the successes and blunders of digital engagement and relationships.

The authors cover how organizations adapt to the new business environment by blending social strategy, marketing technology and customer experience leveraging the Experience Marketing Framework (EMF).

Wright and Snook deliver on a deep walkthrough of how an organization realigns to meet the dynamic needs of buyers. The beginning includes a great story about the KC Chiefs, but leaps into some definitions which may seem disorienting at first. However, they bring it all together with a ‘pop’ and you begin to see how it coalesces. With some great humor, there is a tremendous number of blueprints, high-level steps, and resources. The book is a bit overwhelming, however, it is well organized and useful to revisit as a reference as your organization makes changes or evolves. As both a practitioner and analyst in the space, _Digital Sense_ is a comprehensive read. This summary will truly provide only a taste of the many nuggets in the book.
