  ### Consider Employees Your Most Important Customer


  > "The best way to offer outstanding service to our guests is to offer it to
  our employees."- Disney U, page 11


  Should a serious business care about the happiness of its employees? The
  answer is a resounding “yes” at Disney. In creating “The Happiest Place on
  Earth” for park visitors, the Disney team learned the vital importance of
  training and developing the cast and crew that stage the “show.” Management
  appreciates that what happens “on stage” is a direct consequence of what
  happens back stage.


  Handpicked by Walt to train the first “cast members,” Van France, along with
  Dick Nunis and others, revolutionized the concept of employee training to the
  demands of a rapidly growing organization with theme parks on three
  continents. Thus from the start, Disney U has enjoyed unwavering leadership
  support, allowing for the evolution of a comprehensive approach to the
  development and care of all employees.


  **What began as simple employee orientations morphed into broad programs that
  have enabled the company to prosper even during massive changes and economic
  downturns**. **Even in hard times, while other organizations trim training and
  development budgets, the Disney approach is to enhance and leverage them in
  order to remain successful.**


  The wisdom of this approach has been affirmed several times over as Disney U
  came to the rescue to meet challenges of growth, engagement, and culture,
  saving the brand and profitability simultaneously. It is a valued part of the
  organizational culture.


  By sharing insider stories of how the company survived major challenges
  through training innovations, Lipp supports his assertion that **a company is
  only as strong as its employee development program.**

  ### Instill pride rather than servility in employees


  > "Everyone picks up the trash. No one is above pitching in and helping."-
  Disney U, page 155


  Disney fosters employee engagement by taking the servility out of service
  jobs. Van France understood at the deepest level the importance of creating
  pride among employees as he created a movie-based terminology for success
  which has been copied around the world. Thus park employees are “hosts and
  hostesses” or “cast members” who wear “costumes” rather than “uniforms,” while
  the visitors are not customers but “guests.” “Crowds” are called “audiences.”


  **“I wanted people to feel they were involved in something more important than
  parking cars, serving food, sweeping up popcorn, that they would be creating
  happiness for others,” Walt Disney explained.**


  Top management stays in contact with the day-to-day realities faced by park
  staff. No one is too high and mighty to do front-line duty now and then. This
  is not just a coat of paint, Lipp notes: “Everyone picks up the trash” is a
  lived cultural value at Disney as even executives are known to stoop over to
  pick up litter, don costumes, and greet guests. And front-line employees are
  encouraged to make on-the-spot decisions to resolve problems, e.g., to replace
  a child’s spilled popcorn free. This “popcorn empowerment” costs but pennies
  and is worth its weight in gold in producing staff loyalty.


  **Nor is anyone too low to have their voice heard. Employee feedback sparked
  the tunnel upgrades, an employee park, and other recreational opportunities
  that enhance retention.**


  During its first fifty years, Disney University adapted to company needs and
  will continue to do so, Lipp concludes. At the same time, its twin core values
  of caring for employees and customers serve as a beacon to other organizations
  seeking success and sustainability.

  ### Model the Behaviors You Want Employees to Learn


  > "Quality is essential in guest courtesy, in showmanship, and throughout our
  backstage activities as well as those on stage."- Van France, quoted in Disney
  U, page 160


  Disney envisioned Disneyland a huge stage, and accordingly, it became all
  about putting on the best show. Disney U Dean Van France was determined to
  have employees committed to creating Disney magic for park guests at every
  turn. For example, he insisted that clothes must be spotless. Everything
  should gleam. Front-line employees— “the cast”—must learn to smile and to
  gesture with an open palm, never pointing a finger. In short, Snow White must
  never have a bad day, and the rides must never break down.


  **To instill the Disney commitment to superlative service, its training
  programs needed to model—not merely preach—that cultural value to employees.
  “Do as I say, not as I do” was not and still is not acceptable.**


  Thus Disney U trainers walk the talk: the training rooms are impeccable, with
  chairs neatly aligned—even after breaks. Instead of rushing around before
  lessons start, beaming trainers focus warmly on trainees as they arrive. Even
  back stage areas, e.g., the tunnels that cast and crew use between park areas,
  are kept painted and well lit to maintain morale.
f_conclusion: >-
  As I see it, breaking out of the old HR box where employees are treated as
  interchangeable widgets rather than important partners is good for business.
  _Disney U_ belongs right next to Tony Hsieh’s [_Delivering
  Happiness_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/delivering-happiness/) and
  Wagner and Harter’s _12: The Elements of Great Managing_ as more testimony to
  the value for creating environments in which employees can flourish. Lipp’s
  book also reminds us that Disney U has been putting that wisdom into practice
  for over half a century. When will other organizations catch up?

Growing up just 12 miles from Disneyland, I was thrilled to visit “The Happiest Place on Earth” during its grand opening and several times a year thereafter. By the time I returned for D-land’s 50th anniversary, Walt Disney’s vision had mushroomed from a single 85-acre theme park into a global conglomerate spanning the globe on land and sea.

Yet one Disney feature has remained constant throughout the years–**its world-renowned customer service. With fluctuating markets and changing leadership, how has the Disney brand consistently managed to maintain this world-class act, generally regarded as the gold standard, for over half a century?**

In _Disney U_, Doug Lipp provides the answer: Disney University, which assures that all employees from Anaheim to Paris, from janitor to COO, are committed to delivering stellar customer service. In this insider’s view of the evolution of Disney U, Lipp weaves together anecdotes and lessons of the legendary Van Arsdale France, to create a model for other organizations who would like to achieve a similar reputation for service.

Employee development programs are not extras; they serve as company health barometers, Lipp asserts. Organizations who want to flourish will find his book a welcome resource for adding some Disney magic to their training.

Consider employee engagement in your organization: Does management treat employees as the most important customer? Does everyone “pick up the trash?” What changes would you recommend for creating happier employees? What steps could you take on your own?
