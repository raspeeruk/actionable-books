  ### Organizations Cannot Naturally Disrupt Themselves


  > "The way schools have employed computers has been perfectly predictable,
  perfectly logical – and, if transforming learning is the goal, perfectly
  wrong."- Disrupting Class, page 73


  When we look at disruptive technologies in the for-profit sector, innovation
  disrupts and eventually eliminates established businesses, primarily because
  the innovation in question addresses non-consumers – those individuals who had
  not previously been customers for the established market leaders. In contrast,
  **the public education system enjoys a near monopoly, which provides no place
  for disruptive technologies to attract new consumers.**


  When we look at the ways computers have to-date been used, they’ve primarily
  served as a replacement to older technologies (think paper and notebook) or a
  topic for courses (think word processing rather than typing.) **In every other
  area of our lives, new technologies have transformed the way we communicate,
  collaborate, and create – except in education.** Our schools, in contrast,
  have adapted technology to existing models, rather than disrupting how they
  deliver and measure teaching and learning.

  ### Disrupting Toward Student-centric Learning


  > "The entire system for creating education materials, making the decisions
  about which materials to adopt, and delivering the content to students must
  and will change."- Disrupting Class, page 125


  In the two-stage process by which existing systems are disrupted, the value
  network that supports our public education system will give way to a new
  network focused on facilitating individualized learning. At present, the
  production, distribution, and marketing of textbooks determines most of what
  is taught in class and how it’s taught. In the future, however, **facilitated
  networks of user-generated, collaborative content will serve to disrupt the
  current network, finally creating a healthy student-centric learning
  economy.**

  ### Education Markets Ready for Disruption


  > "Like all disruptions, it first appears as a blip on the radar, and then,
  seemingly out of nowhere, the mainstream rapidly adopts it."- Disrupting
  Class, page 91


  The authors identify four areas where computer-based technologies are already
  taking root to meet the needs of underserved populations:


  *   AP classes offering college-level courses to high school students

  *   Urban secondary schools, primarily in low-income areas, where resources
  are constrained

  *   Homebound and home-schooled students, where traditional classroom
  education is either impossible or undesired

  *   Credit recovery for students who need to make up credits


  In each of these populations, **new education providers are already meeting
  the needs that traditional public schools can’t.** We can expect advances in
  technology to continue to improve the ability of the software and to reduce
  the cost of online education. The best news is that as these technologies
  become more widely available and affordable, public schools will adopt them en
  masse.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Disrupting Class_ has changed not only the way I view the business of public
  education but also the way I handle my career. As a salesman whose sole focus
  is introducing disruptive technology to K-12 education, I’ve had to reevaluate
  the system in which I work – to identify where my solutions can affect the
  transition to student-centric learning and how I can support my customers in
  their passion to personalize teaching and learning. What this book reminded me
  (and what I see in schools every day) is that educators deeply care for their
  students – a point which must not be minimized, especially if we desire to
  assist them in their calling. I am encouraged by _Disrupting Class_ – by the
  technological advancements outlined in its pages and by the future of our
  schools and our world. It’s an excellent era to work with public education.

  "The United States has kept its technological edge in the world not because
  its public schools are sending the best potential technologists to U.S.
  colleges. The United States is clinging to its advantage because it has
  continued to be a magnet for the best talent in the world."

> "The United States has kept its technological edge in the world not because its public schools are sending the best potential technologists to U.S. colleges. The United States is clinging to its advantage because it has continued to be a magnet for the best talent in the world." _\- Disrupting Class, page 6_

Clay Christensen’s research into disruptive innovation, as detailed in _Disrupting Class_, provides the foundation for a look at the challenges of introducing disruptive technologies to our public school system. With an initial examination of the struggles and challenges facing our current educational system, Christensen and his co-authors, Michael Horn and Curtis Johnson, outline the key factors our schools face:

*   Every student learns in a different way, making student-centric learning the next frontier.
*   Society has changed the goal of schools, making teachers and administrators jobs more challenging.
*   Migrating from a monolithic method of instruction to student-centric instruction presents an opportunity for technological advancement.
*   But, the addition of computers to classrooms, a sixty billion dollar effort, has resulted in virtually no improvements in student achievement.

The question then becomes: how do we meet these challenges to arrive at the end goal of high quality, individualized education for every student?

Do you work with schools or have children in school? Have you seen an increase in online teaching and learning? Have you or your school administration made a concerted effort to improve personalization of the teaching and learning process? What has been the result? What would you change?
