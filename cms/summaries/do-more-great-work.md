  ### Do More Great Work


  > "When I say 'Great Work,' I'm not talking about a standard of delivery. I'm
  talking about a standard of impact and meaning."- Do More Great Work, page 13


  This may be a first – having the book title as our The Big Idea. Rather than
  taking this as a sign of laziness on my part, I choose to explain it as this:
  Our goal with “The Big Ideas” is to highlight one particularly actionable
  point from each business book. Bungay Stanier’s entire book is actionable. Not
  only that, it has a singular, succinct point: we are happier – more fulfilled
  – when we are engaged in work that stretches us and makes a positive impact in
  the world. And yet.


  And yet, we spend so little of our time engaged in these types of activities.
  Instead, we spend most our time in the weeds, doing “bad work” or, most
  insidious of all, “good work”. A few quick definitions:


  **Bad Work:** This is work that is pointless. It creates no value and it sucks
  our souls. “Bureaucracy, interminable meetings, outdated processes that waste
  everyone’s time, and other ways of doing things that squelch you rather than
  help you grow.” _(pg 4)_


  **Good Work:** This is the stuff you’re paid to do; paid to deliver. It’s
  thing things that need to get done, and you’re fairly happy to do. It’s
  efficiency focused and (most likely) takes up the vast majority of your day.


  The cost of doing bad work is, hopefully, fairly obvious. The challenge is in
  understanding the threat that good work poses. It’s “productive”, it’s
  typically something you’re good at, and you’re never going to get into trouble
  for doing good work well. It’s safe. And this is a trap. Doing good work never
  moves anything forward. It doesn’t energize us, it doesn’t challenge us, it
  doesn’t allow us to make a dent in the world. It’s important, and will always
  have a place in our professional lives, but – and here’s the ultimate point –
  **doing good work with excellence is not the same as doing great work.**


  For the sake of our sense of self, and for the good of our careers and our
  companies, we need to engage in more great work. So how do we do that?

  ### When You Can't Say No


  > "The answer is not to focus on saying no but rather on saying yes more
  slowly."- Do More Great Work, page 90


  There’s a good chance that you already know of a great work project you could
  be exploring. It’s the idea that you had a while ago, but never put into
  action. It was never the right time. The truth is, it will never be the right
  time. Your calendar’s never going to just open up and provide you with months
  of unfettered time so you can explore those exciting, Great-work projects. But
  you can carve out time to work on these things, if you protect your calendar
  intelligently.


  One of the best ways to protect your calendar to allow for more Great work
  projects is to cut back on the number of things you say “Yes” to. If you’re
  good at what you do (and if you’re reading this, you likely are), people will
  come to you for help, guidance, support or insight. There’s nothing wrong with
  that, and there’s nothing wrong with helping people out. In fact, it’s
  extremely important. What you can do, however, is – as Bungay Stanier puts it
  – “say Yes more slowly”.


  Rather than immediately agreeing to help, do something, or be on a committee,
  try responding with some of the following questions (taken from page 90-91 of
  _Do More Great Work_):


  **Why Me?**  

  – May I ask why you’re asking me?  

  – Have you considered asking X? He’s got some experience with this.


  **What’s the Brief?**  

  – When you say “Urgent”, what does that mean? When’s the latest it has to be
  done by?  

  – If I could only do part of this, what part would you like me to do?


  **What’s the big picture?**  

  – Have you checked this out with my boss?  

  – What should I not do so I can do this?


  Not only do you delay saying “Yes” immediately with these questions, you
  actually help the other person gain clarity on their own objectives and are
  valuable to the process without becoming a **part** of the process… which, of
  course, frees you up a little to pursue your own Great Work projects.

  ### Slow Down


  > "Because we're in a hurry, we often just grab the first half-decent idea
  that comes along, regardless of whether it's the best idea we could have. I
  call this 'first-idea-itis'."- Do More Great Work, page 112


  One of the reasons we don’t do as much great work as we could is due to the
  speed at which we’re (apparently) trying to get through our lives. We take
  pride in check marks, and moving through To-Do lists.


  Great work is hardly ever an item on a To-Do list. Great work takes deliberate
  focus, energy and thought. It requires carving time out of our To-Do schedule
  and slowing down long enough to actually think beyond the immediate problem or
  solution. _Do More Great Work_ comes complete with 15 “maps”, or visual
  exercises you can work through to find, select and create action around your
  own great work projects. The exercises guide you through the thought process
  of what’s important to you, why, and how acting on it could/would have a
  positive impact on your life and career. Here’s a quick one to get you started
  in defining your own great work project:


  Great work demands (and allows) that you be at your best – your greatest.
  Think back to a few specific instances where you were at your best. Think
  about how you felt, how you spoke, what the setting was, and the details of
  the project. Then jot down a series of comparisons that answer the prompt: “I
  am this… …not that.” (Map 3 from page 44 of _Do More Great Work_._)_


  **Examples:**  

  I am intelligently witty… …not condescending or dry.  

  I am well prepared with bullet points… …not scripted or trying to memorize.  

  I am succinct and focused… …not long winded.


  Jot down as many as you can. Read them over and get a sense of what types of
  work you are doing when you are at your personal best.
f_conclusion: >-
  Really and truly, Great Work is the only work worth pursuing. You’ll never
  escape Good Work, but the good news is that you don’t need to pursue it, it
  will always find you. Hopefully you can eliminate (or at least minimize) Bad
  Work, but it is certain that you will **very** rarely be involved in truly
  Great Work unless you actively pursue it. And, with a resource like _Do More
  Great Work_ at hand, it’s now that much easier. Go. Make a dent.

Of all the coaching and productivity tools that exist out there, one that has had a lasting impact on me is Stephen Covey’s _Importance vs Urgency Matrix_, first explained in [_The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/)_._ I like the model because it’s simple, easy to remember and extremely powerful in managing your projects and time. One of the challenges with the model is that, while it does an excellent job of helping you _classify_ which activities are important, it’s not particularly strong at helping you figure out **how** to do those activities.

Which is why I was delighted to come across Michael Bungay Stanier’s book _Do More Great Work;_ an approachable, easy to digest guidebook for not only identifying what great work means to you, but also for helping you commit to and follow through on that great work.
