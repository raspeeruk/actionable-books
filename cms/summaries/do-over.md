  ### The Career Savings Account


  > "Relationships + Skills + Character x Hustle = Career Savings Account"- Do
  Over, page 7


  My biggest take away from _Do Over_ was the importance of building your Career
  Savings Account (CSA).


  Very simply, these are the areas that you need to invest in over the course of
  your career to be equipped to handle the career bumps, jumps, ceilings and
  opportunities that you may encounter.


  Think of it this way. Most of us have some money saved as an emergency fund,
  right? Well, think of your CSA as basically the same thing. This “Career
  Savings Account” will be your security along with your ammo to help get you
  through, navigate and take advantage of the various job obstacles that you
  might encounter throughout your career. Your career savings account is made up
  of:


  *   **Relationships** — who you know.

  *   **Skills** — what you do.

  *   **Character** — who you are.

  *   **Hustle** — how you work.


  Your career will take twists and turns, but investing in these four buckets
  positions you to be successful in any scenario. I think we would all agree
  that these are straightforward components of what it takes have success in any
  area, not just your career.


  The problem lies in that you’ve probably never applied these CSA components
  directly to your job. When you come to a point in your career where you
  experience a career bump, jump, ceiling or opportunity, you’ll need
  investments in each of these areas to get back in the career game quickly and
  successfully.

  ### Head down, head up


  > "Awareness is critical because like relationships, not all hustle is created
  equally."- Do Over, page 228


  I am a firm believer that hard work is a critical factor in success of any
  kind. However, hard work alone won’t get you to where you want to be. You must
  be working on the right things relentlessly over time to get the results that
  you want. I absolutely love the quote above from Acuff, so much that it bears
  repeating: _“Awareness is critical because like relationships, not all hustle
  is created equally”._


  Again, this all comes back to the premise that we must be working on the right
  things to get us to where we want to end up. Now how exactly do we do that?
  Easy. Put your head down and work hard, but every so often raise your head to
  make sure that you’re going in the direction that you want to go. Hustle with
  awareness, otherwise, that hustle will get you to the wrong place fast. As
  Acuff writes, “You don’t have to know the exact path, because nobody does, but
  are you roughly headed in the right direction? If you want to be a musician
  and you’re a pharmaceutical sales rep working seventy hours a week, not
  playing any music, stop kidding yourself.”

  ### You have more skills than you think


  > "It’s hard to read the label when you’re inside the bottle"- Do Over, page
  94


  Most of the skills we possess, we don’t think of as “skills”. To us, they are
  just things we do. Let me give you an example. I am in sales and my job
  requires that I cold call prospective clients. To me, it’s just a part of the
  job. I pick up the phone, I call the client and explore whether or not it
  makes sense to potentially do business together. No biggie to me. But, having
  the ability and nerve to just pick up the phone, make that call and succeed in
  making that call, is a very valuable skill. That is something I can take with
  me no matter where my career leads me.


  Does that make sense? Good. Now it’s your turn. Acuff gives the reader a very
  simple, two-step exercise to help self-assess the skills that we do have.


  First, take out a stack of note cards. Now, all you do is write one skill you
  currently have per card. Jon is going for quantity not quality here. Now
  answer the follow questions, individually, until you can’t think of any more
  to write. Then move on to the next question…


  1.  What are you good at?

  2.  What comes naturally to you?

  3.  What do people pay me to do?

  4.  What are you afraid of?

  5.  If you wrote an eBook, what would the topic be?


  Next, look for patterns and group those note cards together.


  I know, I know, these self-awareness exercises can be challenging to sit down
  and actually do. But this exercise is so simple and powerful so just do it!


  What I often find is that we’re too hard on ourselves. We downplay our own
  skills and abilities in a way that can be detrimental to our long term growth
  and development. The reality is that each one of us is more capable than we
  think we are. That is a profound truth, and the more we’re able to realize
  that fact the more confidence we’ll gain and the more success we’ll have.
f_conclusion: >-
  For most of us, we’ll spend about a third of our lives working. That’s a
  staggering percentage and I would think that number will rise. That time
  should be invested in doing something that we love, in a career that best
  suits our personalities and our skills, and fulfills everything we desire out
  of a career.

> "We save for rainy days when it comes to our bank accounts but don’t do anything to protect our careers from the storm" _\- Do Over, page 11_

What if you could change the way you looked at your job? What if you could get unstuck? What if you could call a do over? These are the big questions that bestelling author Jon Acuff asks us in his new book, _Do Over_.

I’ve always loved the quote “The journey of a thousand miles, begins with one step.” So simple, yet so true. And our careers are no different. During our professional lives, whether voluntary or involuntary, we will all experience a career bump, a career jump, hit a career ceiling, or you’ll be graced with a surprise career opportunity.

In _Do Over_, Jon Acuff teaches us about the four elements all great careers have in common: **relationships, skills, character** and **hustle**. These are the four areas that one needs to invest in over the course of their career to be armed to handle the inevitable career bumps, jumps, ceilings and opportunities.

Are you ready to call a do over?

The reality is, no matter where that journey takes us we have all the ability to call a do over and take all of our acquired skills, knowledge and expertise and put it towards that amazing career that we all deserve.
