  ### Meaningful Work Can Lead to Resistance


  > "Resistance is a repelling force. It’s negative. Its aim is to shove us
  away, distract us, prevent us from doing our work."- Do the Work, page 6


  Now that we know what all these unproductive thoughts are, we can use the
  following tools to identify the characteristics of Resistance. We’re
  experiencing the Resistance when:


  *   We start to question ourselves and the foundation of our projects too
  often

  *   We feel negative energy flowing around us; we seem to lose our passion for
  the things we used to love doing everyday

  *   We become easily distracted and we start to procrastinate in order to
  avoid working on our ideas


  The hardest thing to do is to realize when the Resistance is working against
  us. Once we are able to identify it, then the fight becomes a lot easier to
  win.

  ### Be Ready For It When You Least Expect It


  > "Ignorance and arrogance are the artist and entrepreneur’s indispensable
  allies."- Do the Work, page 12


  The Resistance does not necessarily emerge when we’re about to finish
  something. Unfortunately, it can also prevent us from actually starting a
  project. Just remember the last time you had a great idea you were really
  excited about. But, when it was time for you to take the plunge, something in
  the back of your mind told you that maybe, after all, it was not such a big
  idea and that you should not go ahead and pursue it. It could have been a
  thought about a potential failure, questioning whether you were the right
  person, or maybe a doubt that your idea had no potential. Either way, you now
  know what you were faced with and, unfortunately in that case, the Resistance
  succeeded.


  If we want to be able to accomplish anything significant, we have to be
  willing to fight the Resistance all the time. The good news is that from the
  moment we understand what is controlling all these unproductive thoughts, we
  will stop doubting ourselves and keep working on our
  project/book/play/song/business, etc. In addition, each successive conflict
  becomes easier and easier to win.


  “We can always revise and revisit once we’ve acted. But we can accomplish
  nothing until we act.”

  ### Conquer It Once and For All (Or Not)


  > "Rule of thumb: The more important a call or action is to our soul’s
  evolution, the more Resistance we will feel toward pursuing it."- Do the Work,
  page 9


  When we understand that the Resistance is present, it is much more manageable
  to get back on our feet and re-immerse ourselves in that passionate state of
  mind that led us to start our projects in the first place. Here are three ways
  to fight the Resistance and never allow it to control us again:


  *   Stay stupid: Don’t allow yourself to **think** too much about the
  projects; instead concentrate on actually **doing** things

  *   Trust the Soup: Trust that source of inspiration for our initial idea, and
  realize that we cannot control nor predict everything

  *   Understand that we are not alone at experiencing this Resistance. All
  great and successful artists/entrepreneurs/writers, etc. have experienced (and
  conquered) their own Resistance


  It is also important to understand that the Resistance is always present. Its
  sole purpose is to get in the way of our creativity and prevent us from
  finishing something significant. Even after we conquer it once the Resistance
  will come back and haunt us during each and every project we undertake.
  However, the mere realization that we will eventually confront it during
  difficult times, gives us sufficient power to ensure that its effects are
  minimized and our projects no longer get (fully) derailed.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Do the Work_ will help anyone get unstuck and back on their feet in pursuing
  their passion and completing their projects. If you enjoyed Pressfield’s
  previous book _The War of Art_, you will enjoy this one even more. _Do The
  Work_ is a fast read (98 pages) and in my opinion is a lot like jumping into
  an ice-cold lake: it wakes you up, makes you forget about all the
  none-essential things you were doing before, and forces you to understand that
  you are not alone in experiencing the symptoms of Resistance. But perhaps most
  importantly it inspires you to return to your projects full of passion and the
  strength to carry on and finish.

Have you ever been in a situation where you’ve being actively working on a project for a long time, putting your time and effort, your sweat and tears and your financial resources into something that you know will make the world a better place? You are about to approach the finish line, but then all of a sudden, something happens. All sorts of thoughts begin to rush through your head and you begin to question yourself and all your hard work. Such thoughts as “What in the world am I doing?” “This is the stupidest thing I have ever thought of….” “I cannot believe I invested so much of my own money and time into building this thing/book/play/song/business…” “Why didn’t anyone stop me?” “What was I thinking?…”

If any of the above thoughts have ever entered your mind, then you have come face to face with the **Resistance**. According to Steve Pressfield’s book _Do the Work_, the Resistance is an ensemble of counterproductive thoughts that emerge in our minds with the aim to extinguish our creative ideas and prevent us from finishing our projects. _Do the Work_ is designed with one purpose: to let us get back in control of our creative minds, break free from this Resistance, and ship our final products.
