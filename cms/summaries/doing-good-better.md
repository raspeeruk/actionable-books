  ### Give to the Extremely Poor


  > "If you earn as much as the typical American worker, then you are one
  hundred times as rich as the very poorest people in the world, which means
  additional income can do a hundred times as much to benefit the extreme poor
  as it can to benefit you or me."- Doing Good Better, page 22


  An average American worker earns $28,000 a year and is in the top 5% of wage
  earners worldwide. If you earn $52,000 a year, you are in the top 1%. Even
  those at the United States poverty level making $11,000 a year are living on
  $30 a day and usually, have access to social programs that shore up resources
  so they can maintain a high standard of living.


  The poorest people in the world live on $1.50 a day—that is equivalent to what
  $1.50 would buy in the United States and includes food they grow themselves.
  They struggle to get food and clean water. They suffer from health issues that
  we have eradicated. They lack access to information and resources to solve
  these and other problems. They have a poor quality life and do not live long.


  The ultimate value of altruism is increasing another person’s health and
  longevity, and we have the most opportunity in the poorest nations. A QUALY is
  a way to assign a value to ‘increasing the quality of life.’ One QUALY
  represents one year of perfect health and 34 QUALY’s are equivalent to ‘saving
  a life.’ In developing countries money buys 100 times the QUALY’s as it does
  domestically. If we allocate our resources wisely, we can all save lives and
  dramatically improve the quality of life for those who suffer the most.

  ### Earn to Give


  > "Earning to give means exactly what is sounds like: rather than trying to
  maximize the direct impact you have with your job, you instead try to increase
  your earnings so you can donate more, improving people’s lives through your
  giving rather than your day-to-day work."- Doing Good Better, page 76


  It is not necessary to choose work that benefits those you wish to help
  directly. Someone else may be better qualified or in a better position to do
  the job. The best way to help is often by choosing work that you enjoy doing
  and will pursue successfully. When you are a good fit for your job, you have a
  better chance of earning more and working extra hours. You will be able to
  donate that extra income to those who perform the work to help those who need
  it most.


  Jobs with corporations or government may not spark with idealism like a
  non-profit but as MacAskill writes, “Most of the incredible progress that
  humanity has made over the last few hundred years has not been due to the
  activities of nonprofits but through technology and innovation generally
  spurred by for-profit companies and governments.” Many for-profit companies
  are excellent places to work and provide not only higher incomes but important
  jobs that stimulate progress and benefit others in countless ways.


  Some additional insight on volunteering: if your goal is for your
  philanthropic activity to do the most good and you are a volunteer, be sure to
  limit the gift of your time to engaging in activities you are skilled in and
  donating where they are needed. We all know for-profit companies spend
  significant resources on employees, and volunteers can drain resources from
  non-profits. Although you may enjoy volunteering it may be more helpful to
  enjoy doing another activity and leave the work to the organization. You may
  choose to work the time you would have volunteered and donate your income.

  ### Focus on a Neglected Area


  > "It means that the most popular causes are, precisely for that reason, the
  ones where it will be difficult to have a big impact. Because of diminishing
  returns, we can make a much bigger difference if we focus our efforts on areas
  which comparatively fewer resources have been spent, like less-publicized
  disasters, or global poverty rather than domestic poverty."- Doing Good
  Better, page 66


  The holidays may inspire contributions to the local cause. End-of-year
  tax-deductions may prompt donations to national organizations. News of a
  disaster may incite an emotional need to fund aid. A friend suffering from a
  disease may trigger a desire to support research for a cure. Donating to
  common causes might make us feel good, but it has the least positive impact.
  Those causes and organizations that receive the most publicity also receive
  the most donations and have the most access to resources. The value of our
  money diminishes when funding is plentiful.


  The least funded organizations support those who suffer the most. These people
  live in extreme poverty every day. It is hard for us to make an emotional
  connection because we cannot see them or evidence of suffering. Our lives are
  dramatically different from theirs. The media does not enlighten us, and we
  are rarely aware of our position globally. Not a lot of money will improve
  their quality of life dramatically. It is harder to have a conversation about
  causes with which others do not readily identify. Choosing neglected causes
  may take some extra thought. It is worth the effort to direct our extra income
  to those who suffer the most because it does the most good for the largest
  number of people.
f_conclusion: >-
  We can all put altruism into action more effectively every day. Choosing to
  focus on the extremely poor is a natural choice when we realize how much we
  have. It takes more effort to look for neglected areas and avoid the most
  popular causes but we get a greater return. We can choose a career that
  maximizes our earning potential so that we can give the most. And remember,
  our time is often most valuable spent earning to donate money instead of
  giving our time. If it is worth our time to optimize our work, it is also
  worth our time to maximize the good we can do with our extra profits.

Altruism is an important part of responsible corporate and personal policy. In _Doing Good Better_, William MacAskill explores the essential questions to ask in order to implement effective altruism and the frameworks for choosing charities, careers, and causes. With these tools, we can increase our impact every time we donate money, volunteer, shop, direct corporate donations, choose a career, or protect the environment. He gives examples but, more importantly, he provides a methodology to determine how we can do the most good in our position with the time and money we have.

To put Effective Altruism into action, MacAskill cofounded the organizations [Giving What We Can and 80,000 Hours](http://www.effectivealtruism.org).
