  ### Dust off your cape


  > "Too many people have lost their capes. Over time, they’ve lost their inner
  belief and conviction that they too, can be superheroes."- Don’t Forget Your
  Cape, page 9


  Superheroes, much like preschoolers, believe in themselves and their
  abilities, doing the right thing, standing up for others and demonstrate an
  unbelievably high (sometimes frustratingly high if you are the parent) level
  of confidence. As adults, we enter the world of business and lose some of this
  confidence (even though our skills, knowledge and abilities far exceeds what
  they were as a preschooler) and feel trapped by organizational barriers that
  sometimes make it difficult to do the right thing and accomplish great things.
  Regaining some belief in ourselves and our abilities is critical to achieving
  greatness and making a difference in our own lives and the lives of those we
  impact. Although it is a simple concept to get your head around, the emotional
  implications are huge. I recently read the summary of [_The Confidence
  Code_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-confidence-code/) and was
  struck by how aligned the concept of donning a cape and having a growth
  mindset is. This innocent mindset without the baggage of how society expects
  you to behave allows us to view situations as adventures and opportunities for
  learning rather than opportunities for failures.

  ### Take a Breath


  > "The big difference between the psychology of a two-year old and the
  psychology of a member of your team is that the two-year old is simply less
  subtle at hiding his or her true feelings."- Don’t Forget Your Cape, page 87


  It’s true. Think of the last time you were in a meeting and someone made a
  negative comment about a member of your team. It felt awful. You may even have
  become defensive. It made me laugh out loud to picture a VP handling the
  attack on his or her team like a toddler and leaning over to the offender and
  biting him or her on the arm as MacPhie hypothesized. MacPhie encourages us to
  acknowledge our irritation, but talk about the situation directly and
  respectively and take a pass on any passive-aggressive approaches. Remind
  ourselves that we are all part of the team for a reason and success relies on
  us working well together.

  ### There is extraordinary value in asking “why”


  > "Ask Stupid Questions. They Rock"- Don’t Forget Your Cape, page 50


  I absolutely love this directive. How many times have you sat in a meeting
  wanting to challenge a key assumption, but did not because you might feel
  embarrassed? The assumption appeared so entrenched in the business; it would
  be stupid to question it. It is by asking these types of questions that we
  will begin to look at situations differently and drive innovation by
  challenging the way things are done. As MacPhie suggests, three year olds do
  not ask “why” just once. They ask it multiple times and keep asking it to try
  and understand why things are the way they are. In more adult terms, these
  deep probing questions and searches for the root causes of a problem can be
  enlightening and lead to new product development and breakthrough ideas.
  According to a recent Conference Board of Canada study, Canada ranks a dismal
  13 out of 16 peer countries on innovation. When faced with these statistics,
  asking a stupid question does not seem quite as silly.
f_conclusion: >-
  Overall, this book intertwines the way we live our lives and the work we do.
  It is about having a choice and choosing to make the most out of every day.
  MacPhie leaves the reader with a compelling analogy towards the end of his
  book: The Grasshopper and the Ant. Old school philosophy would have us believe
  that “grasshoppers” just want to have a good time and live in the moment, and
  “ants” work very hard preparing only for the future. Like MacPhie, I do not
  think this is an either or scenario. Superheroes and preschoolers have both.
  So should the rest of us.

> "So this is a rejection of mediocrity, and an invitation to excellence. Don’t be afraid to be powerful beyond all measure. … Don’t forget your cape. Be a superhero. And deliver on the promise of who you could become" _\- Don’t Forget Your Cape, pages 12-13_

Although Hugh D. MacPhie’s _Don’t Forget Your Cape!_ is a mere 148 pages, it is a strong call to action for individuals to look at their lives, both professional and personal, evaluate their potential and passion in simple, practical terms and not settle for anything less than excellence. Simply put, MacPhie takes important business topics and puts them in the context of the lives of preschool children – his preschool children. The stories and examples are easy to read and provide sufficient context to give the reader a visceral feel for the management topics they represent. The book is divided into nine chapters. One chapter for each of the nine pieces of wisdom a preschooler would share with the reader… keeping in mind that preschoolers have a strong, enviable belief in their limitless potential.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

Like MacPhie, I do not think this is an either or scenario. Superheroes and preschoolers have both. So should the rest of us.

Yet, there is sometimes a lack of alignment between our brain and our actions. MacPhie does not introduce any new or novel ideas or define approaches that have not been mentioned in one management theory or another. All the information he presents makes great sense in business and life. Unfortunately, soon after we close the cover of the book, the emotional engagement and call to action dissipates for many of us. My challenge is: if you know you can be successful and you know you can deal with challenges in a direct, yet respectful and collaborative way, and you can ask curious questions to allow you to look at situations innovatively, why don’t you strive for different outcomes all the time, and why do you let somebody else define you potential? It is highly unlikely my 5 year old would. Perhaps he can remind me to do the same.
