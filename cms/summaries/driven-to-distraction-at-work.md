  ### Take back control


  > "Most people don’t see lack of focus as the root problem… \[Most\] simply
  blame themselves for their failure to being happier or more successful… If
  they even recognize how much their problem relates to impaired focus, they
  deal with it simply by trying to overpower it… They don’t need to work harder,
  just smarter."- Driven to Distraction, page 10


  Hallowell says that many people have developed ways to help them deal with the
  numerous distractions or their “ongoing mental traffic jam”. These behaviors
  help in the short term, but may become regular habits that are present when
  they are not necessary.


  According to Hallowell, you can take control back by “developing habits to
  help you consistently find focus and achieve your goals”. The basics of the
  plan include:


  *   **Energy** – Take steps to monitor your brain’s energy supply as
  diligently as you monitor your gas gage to ensure that your car does not run
  out of gas.


  *   **Emotion** – “You need to learn how to regulate your emotional state…
  know your hot buttons and emotional foibles”.


  *   **Engagement** – You must be connected or engaged to be at your best. Find
  your “sweet spot”: the place that overlaps what you love to do, what you are
  good at doing, and what someone will pay you to do.


  *   **Structure** – “It allows you to focus rather than to constantly be off
  track”. “It refers to the world you create for yourself” and “depends upon
  planning”.


  *   **Control** – Taking back control is critical for the plan to succeed. You
  must exercise your control instead of “allowing modern life to control you”.


  Hallowell says that each of the elements involves the powers that we all
  possess: body, mind, human connection, emotion, and structure.


  Now let’s look at two of the “common ways in which people surrender their
  attention at work”: screen sucking and multitasking.

  ### Multitasking


  > "It is neurologically impossible to concentrate on two tasks at once. What
  people really mean by ‘multitasking’ is switching attention from one task to
  another in rapid succession. If both tasks are boring… you can get away with
  it. But if either or both are complex… \[both\] will suffer, as will you."-
  Driven to Distraction, page 54-55


  The inability to say no when you do not have time or constant _multitasking_
  is another ADT. There are benefits to multitasking in that you are “attentive
  to all that is going on” and you don’t miss anything. Conversely, he shows how
  it becomes problematic because “you are unable to pay full attention to
  anything”.


  Hallowell states that people who are in this category agree with one of these
  or similar statements:


  *   I can’t get my work done without multitasking.

  *   Saying no is hard for me to do.


  Occasionally saying yes when you’re overwhelmed or attempting to do more than
  two activities at once is not an ADT. It becomes one when it interferes with
  your performance.


  If you are “overcommitted…chronically stressed…with no chance to slowdown”,
  then it’s a problem. Hallowell offers suggestions for those who may have this
  ADT:


  1.  Accurately assess the attention and focus needed for a task (this is not
  the same as the amount of attention and focus you _want_ to give). If one of
  the tasks requires attention and focus, it is better not to multitask.

  2.  Practice how to politely decline requests. One way is to say, “I’d love to
  if I had the time to give it the attention it deserves.”

  ### Screen sucking


  > "The solution is simple, but extremely difficult to enact: turn it off. Of
  course, were it that easy, we wouldn’t need treatment programs."- Driven to
  Distraction, page 34


  The first ADT is _screen sucking._ According to Hallowell, people who are in
  this category agree with one of these or similar statements:


  *   If my cellphone is out of reach, I feel distress.

  *   I can waste an hour online without even knowing it.

  *   I often retreat into the cyber work when stressed at work.


  Simply being online or surfing the Internet is not an ADT. It becomes an
  addiction when it interferes with your performance or with your ability to
  complete tacks.


  If one of the statements describes you or if your performance is compromised
  by your time online, then you may suffer from this ADT. Hallowell states that
  people underestimate how long they are online; monitoring your time would be a
  good start. He goes on to offer specific suggestions, which include the
  following:


  1.  Create pockets in your day reserved for screen time. A half hour in the
  morning, a half hour in the afternoon—whatever works for you. Outside of those
  pockets, turn it off.

  2.  Keep a list of things to do when bored other than surfing the web. (It
  would help if that list is not on your computer!)

  According to Hallowell, we are victims of our own creation. He says that
  “labor-saving devices \[have\] catalyzed the unplanned explosion within which
  we live today.” Yet, the distractions or lack of focus does not have to be
  permanent. If turning it off, saying no, using time management techniques, or
  any of the other processes have not worked, Hallowell’s plan is for you_._

  "Multitasking, hopping from project to project, e-mailing while talking on the
  phone, rushing from meeting to meeting to get to the next appointment on time,
  ending the day with a frustrated feeling of neither fulfilling all of their
  goals nor performing at their best, let alone equanimity, when in fact, most
  of the time they do not. Instead, most of these people have a severe case of
  modern life – what I came to call attention deficit traits, or ADT."

Instead, most of these people have a severe case of modern life – what I came to call attention deficit traits, or ADT." _\- Driven to Distraction at Work, page 4_

Does the opening quote include one of your regular actions? What about more than one? In _Driven to Distraction at Work_, Ned Hallowell says that many feel “the overload of mental circuits, and frequent feelings of frustration”. We are losing our inability to focus, which may affect our performance and our sense of well-being.

The cost of distraction is not only an issue for individuals, but also for organizations. Hallowell cites a 2006 _Inc._ study that estimated “$282 million was lost annually” to Internet surfing at work. Another source, Information Overload Research Group, reported that information overload costs the U.S. $997 million annually.

What do you do? Hallowell offers that time-management tools, to-do lists, or multitasking techniques are “band-aids”. The solution is to “retrain your attention” to “recognize that underlying issues of mental distraction… is within your control”.

In part one Hallowell describes six of the most common distractions, the first five he labels as _attention deficient traits_ (ADT): screen sucking, multitasking, idea hopping, worrying, playing the hero, and dropping the ball. For each distraction he provides a case study and suggestions on how to address the distraction. In part two Hallowell offers a basic plan on how to harness five elements (energy, emotion, engagement, structure, and control) to focus and be more productive.

Now let’s look at two of the “common ways in which people surrender their attention at work”: screen sucking and multitasking.
