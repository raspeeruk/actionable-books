  ### Everyone’s Selling Something


  > "Selling isn’t always about convincing the other person to hand over money
  in exchange for a product or service."- Driven, page 192


  I’m sure most people “in business” have heard the saying “_nothing happens
  until somebody sells something_.” (page 192) Most people would also assume
  that this statement applies to the salespeople in the organization who head
  out the door or pick up the telephone everyday to try to sell the company’s
  products or services. Herjavec believes that “_to one degree or another, our
  sales ability is related to our overall success in life_”.


  In his experience, too many people refuse to acknowledge the role that selling
  plays in their lives. He quotes Robin Williams from his role in the movie
  Cadillac Man: _“the closest you can get to another person without sleeping
  with them is to sell them something.”_


  Robert believes that, at its core, selling consists of relating to another
  person and persuading that person to go somewhere he or she perhaps did not
  plan to go.

  ### REAL Leadership


  > "...the most influential quality of great business leaders has less to do
  with leading an organization than with inspiring it."- Driven, page 130


  In Chapter 21, which he calls “When necessary, burn the ships” Robert suggests
  that traditional leadership is based on a concept of shared passion.
  **Leading** conjures a vision of dragging people along as though a rope were
  tied around their necks. It is far more efficient to inspire people to the
  same level of passion you have for the mission at hand. One way to achieve
  this is by making the people you depend upon feel important. Put this
  principle into action by asking questions about them, their work and their
  family. Understand their reality and help them see how pursuing your passion
  will help them individually. “_People respond in a positive manner to those
  who express interest in their lives, and someone who achieves that kind of
  response can serve as an inspiration._”


  Herjavec’s principles are as valuable in the living room as they are in the
  boardroom. Throughout the book he repeats four distinct themes which he
  describes as the different qualities needed to succeed; the ability to
  identify a business opportunity, the vision to shape it into a profitable
  venture, the passion to accept the risk involve in pursuing it and the talent
  to communicate both the vision and the passion to others. This is a rare
  combination. With them, there is still no guarantee of success. “_Without
  them, however, there is no possibility._”

  ### Necessary Passion


  > "Nothing of any consequence was ever achieved without enormous passion and
  total dedication, not to the goal of making money but to the objective of
  becoming nothing less than the best."- Driven, page 74


  Robert believes that those who lack the necessary passion, or never search for
  it deep enough in their souls, risk wasting their potential. He also believes
  in what he calls “_the gold at the end of the rainbow: when you become great
  at something you love, the money always follows._”


  It’s this passion that drives the Wayne Gretzkys, the Serena and Venus
  Williams and the Robert Herjavecs of the world to make the personal sacrifices
  required to be the best. Wayne Gretzky was not driven by the prospect of a
  multi-million dollar, multi-year contract but rather, by the passion to become
  the most successful hockey player of his generation. Passion implies
  sacrifice. Robert “_cannot imagine accomplishing anything of value in this
  world without making some kind of sacrifice. Anyone who is driven to succeed
  recognizes this fact._”

Are you a fan of CBC’s _Dragon’s Den_ or ABC’s _Shark Tank_? If so, have you ever wondered how the panellists got there? In his semi-autobiographical book, _Driven: How to Succeed in Business and in Life_, Robert Herjavec tells of his journey from his arrival in Canada as a 7 year old Yugoslavian immigrant in the company of his parents, to the helm of a multi-million dollar, international hi-tech company and a star of the very popular Dragon’s Den and Shark Tank weekly TV shows.

Organized into 50 work and life principles that Robert attributes to his success, _Driven_ is a “how to manual” offering nuts and bolts instructions on everything from making a successful pitch on the Dragon’s Den to “10 steps to prepare for opportunity”. The principles are illustrated throughout the book by personal anecdotes about his business experiences and the people he has met along the way.
