  ### Let it roll!


  > "The first step to Dropping the Ball is getting over the fear of letting
  that ball roll all over the floor. We have to let it roll to feel the freedom,
  laugh loud and live fully."- Drop the Ball, page 258


  The workforce revolution that began in the 1950s has stagnated. Dufu suggests
  that maybe it‚Äôs because we needed a parallel revolution at home. Study after
  study has proven that gender diversity in the workplace creates better
  outcomes. And it would be the same at home.


  The workplace, however, is light-years ahead of the home where women are
  drowning in unattainable expectations that they must manage A to Z; from after
  school snacks, to board meetings, to carpools, to direct reports, to elder
  care, to financial reports‚Ä¶ you get the picture.


  There is a parable that describes a woman who tires as she is swimming across
  a lake. As she starts to sink, people on the shore yell ‚ÄúDrop the rock!‚Äù
  that is tied around her, pulling her down. As she sinks, they can hear her
  saying, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs mine.‚Äù


  Are you struggling to swim while carrying your own rocks? Dufu suggests we
  need to ask ourselves what matters most. What do we need to let go of to make
  it happen? Who in our lives can help us? Where can your kids, your partner,
  your neighbors, or paid support free up space for you to achieve your goals?


  I‚Äôm a professional speaker. Often, after a talk, women will approach me and
  ask how I ‚Äòdo it all‚Äô; enjoy three kids, my own business, a non-profit
  group, and still have time for a weekly date with my wonderful husband. My
  simple answer is ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt!‚Äù.


  Most importantly, I have an ‚Äúall-in partner‚Äù (more on that below) and a
  team of support‚Äîfrom our neighbors with whom we trade babysitting for date
  nights, to the car pool dance parents, to my elance assistant and my household
  support manager (aka nanny).


  I also made a big decision to drop the ball. I learned to keep the things I
  like and that are important that I do, and outsource the things I don‚Äôt. For
  example, yes, my daughter needs cupcakes for her birthday party. But I doubt
  she cares if I make them or if someone picks them up at the bakeshop!
  Cleaning? Laundry? Those were the first to go! For certain my house will not
  make the holiday tour for best Christmas decorations‚Äîbut since I don‚Äôt
  love decorating anyway, I‚Äôve learned to be OK with that. Seriously, aren‚Äôt
  the Martha Stewart expectations a little much!?


  What balls can you bravely drop?

  ### The Four Go-Tos


  > "When women are physically fit, well networked, visible and well rested,
  their leadership is inevitably advanced."- Drop the Ball, page 225


  Regular and repeated practices allow us to flourish or flounder. Dufu has
  summarized the four most important daily practices to help you flourish into
  what she calls the Four Go-Tos.


  1.  Going to exercise (building your stamina)

  2.  Going to lunch (building your network)

  3.  Going to events (building your visibility)

  4.  Going to sleep (building your renewal)


  These are not rocket science you say. Indeed not. But do you do them? They are
  essential to your ability to prosper at work and in life and impossible to
  accomplish unless you figure out how to free up time. Drop the ball!

  ### All-In Partnership


  > "…many of the women C.E.O.s said they could not have succeeded without the
  support of their husbands, helping with the children, the household chores and
  showing a willingness to move."- Drop the Ball, page 205


  The All-In Partnership is my favorite topic. Dufu begins her book with her
  frustrations trying to get her husband off the damn blue couch. She takes us
  (nodding and laughing all the way) through their journey to achieving what she
  calls an All-in Partnership.


  They were so successful on that journey that Dufu said she came to know at
  least one thing for sure: her success at work and in life was directly
  correlated to the high expectations she had of her husband. And interestingly,
  she noted, the more she expected of him, the more incredible an All-in Partner
  he became! I couldn’t agree more!


  She shares ideas that include:


  *   The importance of showing gratitude

  *   Leave it and trust he will pick it up

  *   Allow him to lead and make mistakes


  Be aware of the stereotype of the dumb dad (think of the Berenstain Bears
  stories in which Mother has to fix poor Father’s many mistakes), and your
  belief that only YOU can manage the home front. This myth stifles everyone’s
  potential says Dufu.


  Perhaps you are thinking:


  1.  “He can’t manage the details.”

  2.  “He isn’t here.” (Dufu’s husband had a stint working half-way around the
  world but they figured out creative ways for him to still contribute)

  3.  “He doesn’t know what’s best for our children.”


  And here’s the trouble with that. The more the mother believes the father to
  be incompetent at home, the more gatekeeping she does. The more gatekeeping
  she does, the less practice he gets. The less competent he feels, the less
  motivated he is to spend time with his children and contribute at home.


  Why is it that you do everything? Reconsider from where you get your value.

  Dufu opened the door to her family struggles with the hope that it will help
  other families achieve the triumphs they now enjoy. She has dropped her
  actionable wisdom on the pages of her book. This is one ball you will want to
  pick up.

> “…when women believe that for us ‘having it all’ must mean ‘doing it all’ – it becomes what psychologists call internalized oppression.” _\- Drop the Ball, page ix_

Even though women make up half the workforce, they still represent only 18 percent of the highest-level leaders. Why? Could it be connected to the fact that just as women reach middle management, they are also starting families? Could it be that the mounting responsibilities at home and at work leave them with little bandwidth to do what they need to do to create success?

Tiffany Dufu, a renowned expert in the women’s leadership movement, thinks so. Her life’s work is advancing women and girls. In _Drop the Ball_, Dufu recounts how she learned to reevaluate expectations, shrink her to-do list and get help from others—freeing the space she needed to flourish at work and develop deeper, more meaningful relationships at home.

Sound appealing? Maybe you need to think about dropping the ball too!

Below are 3 lessons from her fabulous book to help you. But I do recommend you read the whole book. You won’t want to put it down!
