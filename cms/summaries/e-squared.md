  ### FP = IP (Infinite Potentiality)


  > "You can never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change
  something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete."-
  Buckminster Fuller (American Futurist), E2, page xxvii


  In a nutshell: **Most people still operate from the mental architecture of our
  ancestors.** We’re oblivious to the “space heaters” around us.


  Around birth our minds establish a pattern of perception and promptly proceed
  to filter out all else. _Yikes!_ Information that doesn’t neatly fit our
  beliefs gets altered without our even noticing.


  For example, the brain receives 400 billion bits of information each second.
  It would take nearly 600,000 average-size books just to print 400 billion
  zeroes. Despite our narrowness and screening, we amazingly manage to take in
  2,000 bits of information per second. However, what we choose to receive is
  only one half of one-millionth of one percent. The reason 99.9 percent of our
  mind is devoted to things we don’t want is because that has become the world’s
  default setting.


  To refute this alarming global pattern, Grout has established a series of 9
  “experiments” (with tongue-in-cheek names) set up in the fashion of the
  Scientific Method. Read on for two of them.

  ### The Abracadabra Principle


  > "It’s right underneath your fingers, baby. That’s all you have to understand
  – everything is right underneath your fingers."- Ray Charles (American Singer
  & Pianist), E2, page 53


  Most people associate the word abracadabra with magicians pulling rabbits out
  of hats. Actually, it’s an Aramaic term that translates into English as, “I
  will create as I speak.” It’s why Jim Carrey wrote himself a check for $10
  million long before he ever made a movie.


  Your every thought affects the FP. “Instead of being one, continuous
  well-aimed tuning fork, our thoughts are more like a junior high band of
  beginning trumpet players” purports the author. Yes, you begged for peace of
  mind today. But you also expended a considerable portion of your average
  60,000 daily thoughts on its opposite – worry.


  In this experiment, you will magnetize a particular event or thing into your
  life:


  1.  The time required is 48 hours.

  2.  The approach is to scan over the “big catalogue of the world” and decide
  what you intend to garner. The theory is that whatever you focus on expands.

  3.  The question is: Can I pull things out of thin air simply by thinking
  about them?


  Amusingly, here’s what happened with Pam’s “wiseass” friend Chuck. He asked to
  sleep with two girls at once. Sure enough, he met a new woman (whom he now
  dates), ending up in bed with her and her six-year-old daughter, who crawled
  in for a quick snuggle with her mom. Beware of being very specific in what you
  seek!

  ### The Dude Abides Principle


  > "Miracles are like pimples, because once you start looking for them you find
  more than you ever dreamed you’d see."- Lemony Snicket in A Series of
  Unfortunate Events, E2, page 41


  This first principle serves as a foundation. Best described as an ultimatum,
  the hypothesis states that the 24/7 field of possibilities (FP) is yours for
  the asking.


  You demand a clear, unmistakable sign, something that cannot be written off as
  mere coincidence. Set skepticism aside; accept with your whole heart. Then let
  go and observe:


  1.  Pick a time to start the experiment. Grout indicates “now” usually works
  for her.

  2.  Jot down the time and date.

  3.  If you like, repeat the “intention” offered. Or, make up your own.


  If you don’t hear from the FP in 48 hours, feel free to write it off. \[I
  didn’t have to and instead recognized my “sign” in less than 24 hours.\]
f_conclusion: >-
  These two experiments only scratch the surface of what’s possible. Did you
  know there is lodged within you no less than 7 times 10 to the 18th joules of
  potential energy? To bring home the magnitude, Grout indicates that if you
  knew how to liberate this force, you could use it to explode yourself with the
  equivalent of 30 very large hydrogen bombs. Holy! Not that you would want to!

  "If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true,

Author Pam Grout draws us into _E2: Nine Do-It-Yourself Experiments That Prove Your Thoughts Create Your Reality_ with a tale from her early life. Huddled overnight in a drafty massage room with a fellow student, they nearly froze! So much for the romance of listening to Pacific waves! Morning’s light saw an awakening – literally and figuratively. A space heater was discovered inches away. Grout points out a “space heater” – or an invisible energy force – is constantly available to everyone. We just haven’t bothered to turn it on.

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

In any case, quantum physicists for over 100 years have shown the universe is composed of nothing but energy waves and particles that conform to our expectations, judgments and beliefs. **Our every thought affects everything else in the universe.**

What a fun and fascinating volume that intersects science with spirituality – offering us the tools and methods to rewire our brains plus divest of old conditioning once and for all.
