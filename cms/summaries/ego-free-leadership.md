  ### Let go of the driver’s seat


  > "Unknowingly, his conscious intentions were being derailed by automatic
  reactions that prevented him from responding productively. We all do this.
  When faced with uncomfortable feedback, for example, each of us can shut down,
  discredit the source, or blame others—even though we know we should learn from
  the criticism. These reactive behaviors are a symptom of our ego, or
  egosystem."- Ego Free Leadership, page 11


  Of all the lessons in the book, the biggest and likely most difficult for some
  business leaders to embrace is letting go of the notion that you are the
  smartest person in the room. The harsh reality is that until the leader is
  forced to identify his or her own role in the struggles of a company, through
  conscious and unconscious habits, nothing is going to change.


  Too often leaders look for praise, want recognition as the leader or savior.
  This comes from unconscious habits and insecurities, a desire to feel
  important, to always be right, and the leader usually surrounds themselves
  with people who will not challenge them but reinforce this misguided need. It
  is not until someone forces them to hold a mirror to themselves that they can
  see their potential negative influence or impact on an organization based on
  their own ego and unconscious needs. Through open and honest reflection, they
  can identify and begin to work towards changing these habits.

  ### The power of personal bias and self-fulfilling prophesies


  > "Over the years scores of leaders have told me, ‘You should see the ego and
  politics in my organization!’ Perhaps because ego-driven behaviors—people
  avoiding conflict or overcontrolling; personality conflicts; groups assuming
  ill intent or acting with a tribal mentality—are so pervasive, many leaders
  accept them as normal."- Ego Free Leadership, page 60


  The true power of effective leadership results from the ability to understand
  the role your personal biases play in both your success and your struggles.
  When the organization is struggling and the team is continuously fighting
  amongst itself at a development conference, Brandon is challenged by Shayne to
  look at the influence his attitude is having on his team. Only through the
  realization that his fears and insecurities have created silos and resultant
  issues in the various teams does Brandon really begin to unpack his history
  and understand how elements from his past have created biases that he has
  carried forward. As he tries to make himself feel better, and assert his
  leadership position, he in effect sabotages his team by making them feel
  incompetent. Shayne describes the four cultural dysfunctions organizations
  face and how each is triggered by self-worth fears.


  They are:


  *   Conflict avoidance coupled with some potentially abrasive leadership.

  *   “Us vs them” dynamics which create silos.

  *   Leaders being defensive and guarded around development needs.

  *   Employees being reactive, tactical and overwhelmed with excess work.


  The key is to identify these issues as soon as they appear to understand the
  drivers behind them, and then address them before they infect your
  organizational culture. Many of these are driven deeper by the concept of
  self-fulfilling prophecies. This is where we believe ill intent from the other
  side, our reaction proves our belief, and then we only provide the other side
  one way to act. By realizing this sooner than later, any potential conflict or
  disagreement can be resolved before they become embedded within divisions of
  an organization and manifest into silos, crippling your organization’s
  effectiveness.

  ### Open and honest communication is vital


  > "Identifying how we contributed to past failures in life means the
  difference between developing wisdom and repeating the same patterns over and
  over again… Seeing that the last time he fell into this pattern it damaged his
  legacy and severed relationships for a decade provided Brandon with a dose of
  emotional clarity. It allowed him to be guided by what he truly wanted, not by
  what his egosystem feared. Although he was anxious, Brandon was irrevocably
  committed to creating a constructive conversation with the board."- Ego Free
  Leadership, page 127


  Shayne and the team at Learning as Leaders developed a constructive
  communication model they call the **VEDEC model**, which is an acronym for
  vulnerable, empathetic, direct, exploratory, and caring. When used, this
  tactic allows for a far more productive conversation, especially when used in
  conjunction with each other.


  **Vulnerable** – being open with our thoughts, fears and feelings.  

  **Empathetic** – getting a true understanding of the other’s fears allows us
  to understand their position.  

  **Direct** – need for clarity without judgement.  

  **Exploratory** – seek understanding and gather more information.  

  **Caring** – provide support for the other’s position.


  Use of this model allowed Brandon to address concerns from board members
  without agitating them with accusatory tones and allowed him to diffuse a
  potentially disastrous meeting with vocal critics of the organization. In
  managing these skills, he was able to not only advance his own stature within
  the organization, but also further the development of his own leadership team
  leading by example. A formerly dysfunctional team turned itself around through
  the application of some key communication skills and protocol as Brandon and
  his team learned to apply the VEDEC model throughout the organization.
f_conclusion: >-
  Everything starts at the top, and as a leader this is especially true, but
  even more importantly the realization that everything begins with you is
  essential to truly effective leadership. Understanding that the impact of your
  own ego and the resulting decisions based on your internal biases becomes the
  foundation for your leadership means that all leaders need to be self-aware
  and focus not only on their strengths but also their weaknesses or development
  areas. What many have considered “soft skills” such as vulnerability, empathy,
  caring and humility are actually vital to the creation of transformative
  leaders that will drive our success as we grow both personally and
  professionally.

  underestimated how his own ego-driven dysfunctions created a team and

> "Like most smart, self-aware, and highly successful executives, Brandon underestimated how his own ego-driven dysfunctions created a team and organizational culture that virtually guaranteed broader dysfunction." _\- Ego Free Leadership, page xxii_

Unlike many other leadership books, _Ego Free Leadership_ by Brandon Black and Shayne Hughes brings multiple perspectives to life. It focuses not only on the things done well, but on the mistakes made, and how important it is for the leader to let go of self-importance and embrace the concepts of servant leadership, vulnerability, and honesty. Brandon gives us a glimpse into the mind of a CEO as he navigates business issues and personal struggles, and through juxtaposition with the thoughts of his business coach, Shayne, you get an objective viewpoint and outsider view of reality. The strength of the book comes from showing both sides of the issues—from Brandon’s struggle to understand why his team is dysfunctional, to Shayne’s shining a light on the issues and bringing them to the front, forcing Brandon to face them straight on.
