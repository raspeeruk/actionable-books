  ### Vision and Conviction


  > "His vision is so clear. He almost hypnotizes you."- Elon Musk, page 223


  Vision Statements and Mission Statements…every business has them. What
  separates Musk’s companies from the rest is that his vision and his conviction
  is so intense and laser focused that he almost wills himself and his
  organizations to accomplish the incredible feats that they set out to achieve.


  This conviction and drive hasn’t come without some difficulties. “People who
  know Musk well tend to describe him more as a general than a CEO” (220).
  Despite this fact, people who work with him and for him happily work the long
  hours, under extremely high expectations. And while he expects a lot, Musk is
  a leader that deeply cares about his people and the human race.


  Vance writes, “I would argue, however, that his brand of empathy is unique. He
  seems to feel for the human species as a whole without always wanting to
  consider the wants and needs of individuals” (363). Musk’s vision is literally
  about impacting the human species as a whole. As we better understand the
  enormity of that, the better we’ll understand Elon Musk and truly appreciate
  what he has been able to do.

  ### Willpower


  > "For Elon, the word no does not exist, and he expects that attitude from
  everyone around him."- Elon Musk, page 67


  The quote above is a constant theme throughout all of Musk’s business ventures
  and seemingly, in all situations that quote rings true. Whether he is
  recruiting a top engineer, pushing through a tight product deadline, or
  pitching investors, Elon does not take no for an answer. While this can be a
  tough pill to swallow for some of his employees, his vision, conviction, and
  work-ethic allow him to operate is such a manner. One of his employees said,
  “You don’t get to where Elon is now by always being a nice guy, and he was
  just so driven and sure of himself” (68).


  A big take away from this section for me was that if you believe it can be
  done, don’t settle for anything less. He is so sure of the direction of his
  companies, his people’s abilities and what they are doing that he is simply
  pushing his people to be the absolute best they can be. That mindset from a
  leader is inspiring!

  ### Expectations


  > "What Musk would not tolerate were excuses or the lack of a clear plan."-
  Elon Musk, page 126


  In learning about Musk’s ventures, beginning in his early years founding Zip2
  and X.com, through SpaceX and Telsa, is that his expectation for results are
  sky high. He puts a tremendous amount of pressure on his people to get things
  done in a timeframe that seems completely insane to any “normal” person. But
  that seems to be how Elon operates and time and again, he gets the most out of
  his people. While he expects a lot, he easily puts in just as much, if not
  more, work as he asks of his employees. One of his team members remembers a
  time when they worked through the night saying, “He’s not afraid to get his
  hands dirty. He’s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes and has
  epoxy all over him” (127). There is nothing more engaging than seeing your
  leader in the trenches working and fighting alongside you.


  The lesson here for me was that as a leader you can expect high standards and
  excellence out of your people, even at extreme levels, if you back it up by
  walking that same walk. Throughout the book, a lot is said about how hard he
  pushes his people, but time and again, they also mention that he sets the bar
  for that effort and those expectations.
f_conclusion: >-
  It is incredible to learn about successful business people like Elon Musk.
  They not only advance industry, they help others realize what is possible in
  this life. They are human just like you and me. They have to learn and fail
  multiple times before they find success. They simply push and persevere until
  it happens. Elon Musk has certainly done so, and Ashlee Vance did a great job
  capturing his story. Elon Musk continues to advance the world in massive
  groundbreaking ways. While, most of us are not Musk, it does make me think,
  wow we can we advance the world through our own small circles of influence?
