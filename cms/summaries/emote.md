  ### All communication is an emotional exchange


  > "Most verbal communication, even a speech, is not a monologue but a
  dialogue. In a speech, even though the words and ideas are going only from
  speaker to audience, there is always a back and forth of emotions."- Emote,
  page 28


  All communication is an emotional exchange. I believe this is a truism that is
  easy to overlook. I know I can over-focus on the information element of
  communication, especially when I’m tasked with producing a report or workshop.
  And yet, it only takes one misinterpreted email to remind me that content
  alone does not equal successful communication. People respond to content
  emotionally. If you don’t provide the emotional context, people will
  fill-in-the-blanks with their own interpretation. And that usually turns out
  poorly!


  Let’s take a closer look at how we might harness emotions more deliberately to
  strengthen the effectiveness of our communications.

  ### Walk your talk


  > "If the speaker does not feel the passion he is trying to convey, his speech
  will not adequately convey these emotions."- Emote, page 114


  When people ‘walk their talk’, their words, demeanor and actions are aligned.
  Consequently people trust them; they have credibility. When memorable speakers
  ‘walk their talk’ they engage with their listeners by personally experiencing
  the emotions they are asking them to feel. They ensure their words and stories
  are ones they have a personal connection to, so they can genuinely convey
  their key messages with authenticity. While it is possible to enhance verbal
  communications using techniques like speaking with an animated tone,
  expressive body language and facial expressions, and modulating the speed and
  pitch of one’s voice, these techniques will appear contrived if they do not
  align with real, felt emotion.


  From the famous examples I cited earlier (Steve Jobs and Martin Luther King,
  Jr.) through to your own experiences listening to speakers at conferences,
  political rallies and even humble team meetings, engaging presenters are the
  people who tap into their own emotions to arouse those emotions in their
  audience. Stop and think about the last few presentations or conversations you
  have had. How successful were you in engaging your listeners and conveying
  your key messages? Did you use emotion to your advantage or were you swept
  away by emotions you thought you had under control? Do you need to connect
  more deeply with the emotional content of your talk or learn to recognize and
  dial back your passions so you can achieve your desired outcomes?

  ### How do you want people to feel?


  > "The preparation of the speech begins at the end—with a clear understanding
  of what the final emotional state of the audience needs to be."- Emote, page
  70


  Jhingran draws on his experiences writing and delivering speeches as a member
  of Toastmasters International, and he points out that all communication
  formats—presentations, conversations, books, songs, movies—involve emotions.
  Powerful speakers use emotions to enhance memory recall and deliberately guide
  their audience to a specific emotional outcome—be it excitement about a new
  product (Steve Jobs’ iPhone launch) or motivation and buy-in to rebel against
  the status quo (Martin Luther King, Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech).


  Emotions are powerful because they are universal—people all over the world
  feel similar emotions even though they may use different names to identify
  them. Did you know that the Utku Inuit have four different words for
  loneliness? The differences are subtle and so their word choice changes
  depending on _why_ they are feeling lonely.


  This is why Jhingran stresses the importance for presenters to carefully
  consider what emotions they are trying to convey in their presentation. It is
  easy to settle on the first emotion that comes to mind, for example ‘fear’.
  However, if we stop and explore the feeling of fear more deeply, we uncover
  subtle differences that may change our understanding of what we are trying to
  convey. Feelings like anxiety, concern, or trepidation. Only then can we
  identify the appropriate words, stories and images we should use to evoke
  similar feelings in our audience.


  Of course, to successfully lead people on this emotional journey, you also
  need to be aware of their mood at the start of the communication event.
  Effective speakers strive to acknowledge the current mood of their listeners
  and then slowly shift the emotional context of the audience to achieve their
  preferred emotional outcome.


  So the next time you are faced with giving a presentation, or having that
  difficult conversation with your colleague, think long and hard about how you
  want people to feel when it is over. Determine their current emotional state.
  Structure your opening comments to authentically connect with people where
  they are currently at emotionally and then present your ideas using language
  and examples that guide your listener to that desired emotional destination.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Emote_ reminded me about the importance of taking my listeners on an
  emotional journey to strengthen their connection with the content of my
  message. And, I learned I need to reflect more deeply on my own emotional
  connection to my topics if I wish to connect authentically with my listeners.
  Jhingran has inspired me to rethink how I create my workshops and what I focus
  on during conversations. To establish an emotional connection first before
  delivering my content.

> "You have the power to motivate, encourage and inspire with the words you say." _\- Emote, page 16_

Do you agree with this statement? Do you truly believe you have the power to motivate and inspire others? While most of us dream of wielding more influence with people, only a few of us are willing to do what it takes to expand our sphere of influence. Yet, inspiring, persuasive communication is a learned skill; one that can be improved with deliberate and repeated practice.

In _Emote: Using Emotions to Make Your Message Memorable_, Vikas Jhingran shares his approach to motivational speaking. He focuses on identifying “the soul” of the speech or presentation before worrying about the actual content and the mechanics of public speaking. Jhingran also examines numerous speaking techniques that can enhance a speaker’s connection with his audience (things like word choice, use of voice, gestures, movements, props, etc.) although he advises against using techniques that don’t feel authentic to you.

In a world powered by technology and the rapid exchange of news, ideas, and content curation, _Emote_ reminds us that people respond to information emotionally and then process it intellectually. If you want your message to stick, you need to alter the way you share it with others.

Jhingran has inspired me to rethink how I create my workshops and what I focus on during conversations. To establish an emotional connection first before delivering my content.

I did find it a bit challenging to simply read a book about delivering memorable messages as Jhingran’s lessons were being filtered through my current speaking style and experiences. Fortunately, it occurred to me, after I read the book, to do an internet search and I discovered two of his speeches on YouTube!

Seeing Jhingran in action really brought the concepts in _Emote_ to life. There is no substitute for experiencing the power of a masterful presenter and learning from their example. Remember…you too _have the power to motivate, encourage and inspire with the words you say._ Simply put…emote. Start with the heart!
