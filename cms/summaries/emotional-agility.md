  ### Management Idea of the Year


  > "Emotional agility means being aware and accepting of all your emotions,
  even learning from the most difficult ones. It also means getting beyond
  conditioned or preprogrammed cognitive and emotional responses (your hooks) to
  live in the moment with a clear reading of present circumstances, respond
  appropriately, and then act in alignment with your deepest values."- Emotional
  Agility, page 39-40


  This book grew from an article in Harvard Business Review that was downloaded
  250,000 times. The HBR called it a “Management Idea of the Year.” David digs
  deep into the model she originated in that article. It includes four steps to
  take you from “Hooked” to “Thriving.”


  The steps are:


  *   Showing up

  *   Stepping Out

  *   Walking Your Why

  *   Moving On


  Every step is important, of course, but for me the most actionable was
  understanding getting hooked and identifying how to “unhook.” Hooked? You know
  the feeling when you are stuck with a thought or kinesthetic response out of
  proportion to whatever caused it—you’re hooked. David explains two things that
  don’t work when you are hooked: Bottling and brooding. Bottlers ignore, push
  aside, and avoid—sometimes getting repaid with unexpected outbursts. Brooders
  complain, wearing out their friends, spouses, or themselves as they rehearse
  what might have been or what will be—but never moving on. David recommends
  that we instead slow down, show up to the emotions with self-compassion and
  awareness so we can be in control of ourselves, rather than our emotions
  controlling us.

  ### Your Values Will Lead the Way


  > "If you know your own personal values and generally live by them, you are
  also likely to be comfortable with who you are. You don’t need to compare
  yourself with other people because you’re a success—by your own definition."-
  Emotional Agility, page 120


  In detailing how to move from hooked to thriving, David points out that values
  are what helps you make the small, conscious decisions that add up to a life
  well lived. And in case you doubt the importance of making even small
  decisions consciously, consider this stunning example of unconscious
  influence: If you are seated next to a purchaser of snacks or entertainment on
  an airplane you are 30% more likely to also buy! So surround yourself with
  people who share your values to get where you are going in life.


  To guide your conscious choices David advocates awareness of values and a
  deeper connection to your future. She calls it “Walking your Why.”


  To help us identify our values, she recommends we close out each day by
  habitually asking ourselves, “As I look back at today, what did I do that was
  actually worth my time?” As a person who usually agonizes over whether I’m
  living my best life, I found this tidbit very useful. So after a day when I’ve
  spent an hour or two on not so fun cleaning tasks, I’m
  delighted/relieved/amazed/rewarded to realize I DO value a clean and
  well-maintained home, and that value has been honored. So there! (Audible sigh
  of relief.)


  And the book’s take on painful choices grounded in values—such as between
  parenting time and career time—is refreshing. Her point of view is you can
  value two important, yet conflicting, things. That if you consciously
  recognize the push/pull, your guilt can ease as you do your best when
  attending to each role. In her words, “since values relate to quality—rather
  than quantity—of action, the amount of time you spend enacting your values
  doesn’t necessarily reflect how much they matter to you.”


  Further motivation is provided by some astonishing research that proves
  awareness and connection to what’s important (a broad and easily understood
  synonym for “values”) has far-reaching and huge results. In one study, middle
  school minority students spent just 110 minutes writing about what mattered
  most to them. Those students improved their GPA’s enough to close the gap with
  their more privileged classmates. And for some the improvement lasted into
  high school! A similar second study resulted in female college physics
  students outperforming students in the control group. Connecting to what
  matters creates a sense of “self” and strengthens resolve to overcome
  short-term adversity.

  ### Who’s in charge: The Thinker or the Thought?


  > "Detached observation keeps our transient mental experiences from
  controlling us."- Emotional Agility, page 12


  A crucial lesson is to separate “self” from thought (or emotion). David has
  many tips on how to create this distance, which is critical to “Stepping out.”
  Here are five tips that stand out for me:


  **Go to “metaview.”** Mentally create distance by imagining going above or far
  away from the thought you are having.


  **View the thought like a CEO.** Imagine you’re the CEO and you are getting a
  recommendation or opinion from the SVP. Maybe you agree, maybe you don’t. Stop
  before you agree and act in accordance with the thought that just pops into
  your head.


  **Play like LeBron James.** When describing his controversial decision to
  relocate to Miami in 2010, this basketball superstar used the third person to
  create distance. He said, “One thing I didn’t want to do was make an emotional
  decision. I wanted to do what’s best for LeBron James and to do what makes
  LeBron James happy.” You too can use third person to create a new perspective
  on a rote thought or decision.


  **Ask, “What the func?”** That’s short for “What’s the function?” In other
  words, what is this emotion trying to tell me? What’s the message here?” This
  alone could keep you from a Groundhog Day cycle of endlessly revisiting the
  same emotional reactions over, and over, and over.


  **Use your words.** David describes James Pennebaker’s life work exploring the
  impact of “emotionally significant writing.” How did people in Pennebaker’s
  studies achieve “marked increase in their physical and mental wellbeing?” How
  was it they were “happier, less depressed, and less anxious”? It was by
  spending 20 minutes a day for three days writing about emotionally significant
  experiences. You read that right. After that minimal effort the writing group
  also had lower blood pressure, better immune function, fewer doctor visits,
  higher quality relationships, better memory, and more success at work! No
  wonder Pennebaker was asked to help a computer company’s laid off engineers.
  Months later those who participated in emotionally charged writing sessions
  were three times more likely to be re-employed than their non-writing
  colleagues!
f_conclusion: >-
  Perhaps emotional agility can be a new leadership differentiator. As a first
  step, mastering our emotions so that they release their grip can remove a
  potential negative. Beyond that, in today’s world the person who is
  emotionally available and in tune, not just with family and friends, but with
  colleagues, teams and others we work with—will certainly have an edge over a
  person who is not.

The title of Susan David’s book, _Emotional Agility_, is intriguing. What is emotional agility? My take on it is that emotional agility is the ability to use emotion rather than be used by it; to detect, interpret and understand when you become emotionally activated. And then to flip it by creating greater emotional attachment to your own values and your view of what’s possible as a person.
