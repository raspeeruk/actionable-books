  ### EQ > IQ


  > "Emotional intelligence is your ability to recognize and understand emotions
  in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your
  behavior and relationships."- Emotional Intelligence 2.0, page 17


  The book’s premise challenges a traditional understanding of intelligence and
  success. Notably, there is little evidence supporting a correlation between a
  high IQ and a successful career. A person’s IQ is an incomplete assessment
  that excludes obvious intangible factors, and even seemingly tangible ones.
  Emotional Intelligence is as relevant and “tangible” as the Intelligence
  Quotient. Furthermore, one’s personality contributes to the overall success
  and function of a person. An IQ, EQ, and personality are distinct qualities
  that help determine how we think and act.


  Emotional Intelligence is very much intangible, difficult to trace to a
  physical source, like virtuous qualities of love, passion, and kindness. On
  the other hand, our emotions are physically explained in the limbic system.
  Our sensations and life experiences travel up the spine in the form of
  electric signals through three primary parts of the brain. These signals enter
  through the spinal cord, through the limbic system, and into the neocortex
  (the front, rational part of the brain). Intelligence must account for the
  emotional and rational parts of a person.


  Emotions of anger, sadness, happiness, etc. tend to control people. In some
  ways, there’s not much one can do to control the reaction because emotions are
  quite instinctual and reflexive. Each person can learn to spot these reactions
  and to respond appropriately. Emotional Intelligence is very much involved in
  creating habits to recognize and respond skillfully to our emotions. Anyone
  seeking to improve their EQ needs proper knowledge of the personal and social
  competencies, along with productive and daily practice.

  ### Social Competence


  > "Social awareness is centered on your ability to recognize and understand
  the emotions of others. Tuning into others’ emotions as you interact with them
  will help you get a more accurate view of your surroundings…"- Emotional
  Intelligence 2.0, page 136


  Social awareness leads people to perceive other’s perspectives, considering
  all their thoughts and feelings. They are master listeners and comprehenders.
  A strong awareness reveals the ability to accurately pick up on emotions in
  other people and understand what’s really happening on the inside. An aware
  person can cut through superfluous attempts to reveal one’s true feeling
  through intense listening and observation. You need to constantly survey your
  surroundings and observe people’s interactions, expressions, nonverbals, etc.


  Relationship management is the culmination and all-inclusive competency of
  emotional intelligence. One uses social awareness to understand a person’s
  needs and feelings by understanding and managing your own needs and feelings.
  Building relationships, though many times difficult, is one of the goals for
  increasing your emotional intelligence. Human beings are wired to connect and
  overcome the many barriers stemming from our differences. A good relationship
  manager knows how to regularly practice personal and social skills to make
  meaningful interactions and connection.


  The two parts of social competence is social awareness and relationship
  management.

  ### Personal Competence


  > "When you understand your own emotions and can respond the way you choose to
  them, you have the power to take control of difficult situations, react nimbly
  to change, and take the initiative needed to achieve your goals."- Emotional
  Intelligence 2.0, page 98


  Self-awareness is about understanding oneself by accurately perceiving
  emotions and tendencies across various situations. It is the art of
  self-discovery. Each person should be responsible to learn about their current
  disposition, which has been crafted through the nature and nurture process.
  Perhaps the best way to increase self-awareness is to think intensely and
  regularly through your reactions and the purpose underlying every decision.


  Self-awareness is foundational and the starting point to self-management.
  Self-management is your ability to use emotional awareness to stay flexible
  and to positively direct your behavior. The self-manager does not get
  distracted by emotions, instead he/she will tame and redirect wild emotions
  into productive outlets. Putting off momentary needs to pursue larger, more
  important goals is an experience self-managers grapple with each day.


  The two parts of personal competence is self-awareness and self-management. My
  favorite awareness strategy is “Visit your values” and favorite management
  strategy is “Visualize yourself succeeding”.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are 66 incredible, incredible strategies outlined in this book. Simply
  reading through the text isn’t adequate because the knowledge covers a
  lifetime of learning. Henceforth, this book ought to be revisited often and
  slowly, but surely, implemented into our daily life. Perhaps you can focus on
  a new practice each week. Think regularly about the weekly strategy and be
  very intentional to improve upon it.

  intelligence for a form of charisma or gregariousness. Second, they don’t see
  it as something that can be improved."

_Emotional Intelligence 2.0_ is the actionable, practical version of Daniel Goleman’s brilliant book, _Emotional Intelligence_. Travis Bradberry and Jean Greaves created 2.0 with one central focus: to increase the reader’s emotional intelligence. The book is organized around the four elements of personal and social competence. Therein lies 66 practical strategies to improve competence in four areas: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.

This book provides the reader with a code to take an emotional intelligence appraisal through Talent Smart. Talent Smart scores each area of competence from 1-99 and provides actionable strategies with a lower score. The test is meant to be taken before you read the book and should be re-evaluated after reading. Once again, this book is a practical handbook focused on increasing your emotional intelligence, and as such, the reader ought to examine a handful of practical strategies to implement in daily living.
