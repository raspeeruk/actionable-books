  ### Why Enchant?


  > "Great products, services, organizations, and ideas are enchanting; crap is
  not."- Enchantment, page xxi


  So, why enchantment? When does it really count?


  Obviously, you can’t enchant with just anything, but when you do possess an
  idea that will transform business, rock the status quo, or make the world a
  better place, than the more relevant enchantment becomes.


  Guy says that the stakes rise when your idea, product, or service does any of
  the following:


  *   Defies conventionality, conformity, and wisdom of the crowd.

  *   Aspires to lofty, idealistic results.

  *   Requires making difficult, infrequent decisions to make a switch.

  *   Requires some risk to proceed when there’s delayed or nonexistent
  feedback.


  Change is hard. Guy suggests using empathy to navigate for the missing link
  between you and the people you wish to enchant.


  For example, during the 1980’s when IBM had dominated the business market,
  Apple was actually up against the status quo. Guy admits that while Apple
  deeply believed in the Macintosh’s power to boost productivity and creativity
  in this sector, Apple’s actual misstep was failing to understand what their
  potential customers were thinking or feeling at the time.


  _“…We underestimated the difficulty of altering corporate policies and
  overcoming the perception that the Macintosh was easy to use but wimpy in
  terms of raw computational power” (page 3)._


  You may believe deeply in your idea, but what about those on the receiving
  end? What are their current circumstances? What does it really take for them
  to shift from one entrenched habit to something radical and different?

  ### Making Enchantment Endure


  > "The goal of enchantment is a long-lasting change -- not a onetime sale or
  transaction."- Enchantment, page 95


  Ethical enchantment endures.


  One element to help make it last is getting others to _internalize_ your idea,
  vision, or values. This is the stage where they move from shared interests to
  conviction. From simply identifying with something to finally believing in it.
  Their inner feelings don’t conflict, and there’s no coercion or moral
  compromise needed.


  Internalization is the deepest and most difficult level of enchantment, and
  while there are plenty of ways to set the stage for it, one of the most
  important tenets is building and nurturing an ecosystem. An ecosystem is
  another word for community, but there’s a difference between building an
  ecosystem with dynamic chemistry, over one that’s just stagnant and
  superficial.


  In an ecosystem, people help each other and thrive. Everyone’s success is
  intertwined with one another. The key players in your ecosystem could consist
  of your advisors, supporters, evangelists, fans, user groups, websites, and
  blogs.


  However, Guy asserts that when many organizations start to build an ecosystem,
  they have a tendency to dismantle it completely once any negative criticism
  arises.


  _“A healthy ecosystem is a long-term relationship, so an organization
  shouldn’t file for divorce at the first sign of marital discord” (page 107)._


  Instead, he suggests welcoming healthy discourse and criticism. The whole
  point of an ecosystem is to both nourish and improve your idea. It also shows
  that along with your relevance and success, you can also be transparent,
  human, and open to other ideas, too.


  And lastly, have a cause that’s worthy of an ecosystem.


  _“It’s hard to build an ecosystem around mundane and mediocre crap, no matter
  how hard you try”_ (page 106).


  Who are the key players in your ecosystem? Is it an environment where everyone
  is thriving under the banner of your idea? What can you do to improve the flow
  and energy between your key players?

  ### Enchantment Depends On Character


  > "Step one is achieving likability, because jerks seldom enchant."-
  Enchantment, page 9


  Guy argues that before you enchant, your likability must answer some important
  questions: _Are you someone people would listen to? Are you the kind of
  company someone would prefer and enjoy? To create and co-create with?_


  He also presents a simple litmus test which can make, or break, your
  likability:


  *   Do you think of people in binary?

  *   Do you believe you’re superior than someone?

  *   Do you accept people’s similarities as well as their differences?

  *   Do you cut people a break?


  Everyone is better than someone at something. People are more similar than
  they are different. We all have strengths and weaknesses. And the “bad
  qualities” people possess could be rooted in a complex past that’s beyond
  anyone else’s understanding.


  Guy suggests handling people’s imperfections with grace. When you accept
  people for who they are, the people you’re trying to bond with will appreciate
  it. The journey of enchantment, creation, and co-creation becomes easier.


  Trustworthiness also comes into play. Guy notes that even if people like you,
  it may not be enough for them to trust you. He reveals a wealth of compelling
  tips to practice, but the one tenet that requires serious ongoing effort is
  what he calls _“menschdom,”_ with Mensch meaning _“human being”_ in German.


  Here are a few important pointers of menschdom:


  *   Trust others

  *   Always act with honesty

  *   Treat people who have wronged you with civility

  *   Allow people their moment (don’t interrupt or dismiss people’s ideas
  prematurely)

  *   Suspend blame when something goes wrong and instead ask, _“What can we
  learn?”_

  *   Hire people who are as smart, or smarter than you, and provide
  opportunities for growth

  *   Focus on goodwill and give people the benefit of the doubt.


  Menschdom suggests that we must remember the humanity in other people, too.


  Likability and trustworthiness are rooted in one’s character. Since
  enchantment is a process, it becomes harder to fake these aspects over time.
  Squeeze in any compromises or shortcuts, and Guy argues that you rack up
  points on the karmic scoreboard, inviting scrutiny and distrust in the eyes of
  those you’re trying to enchant.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Enchantment_ is touted for the entrepreneur, but it’s truly a tactical
  handbook for anyone who has something meaningful to share and create. The
  ideas are actionable and can immediately be put into practice. The rest of the
  book includes other gems like how to launch, overcome resistance, how to
  enchant your employees, and how to resist unethical enchantment from others.

While some still look for the next best secret to pull heartstrings and earn a quick buck, there are those with daring ideas who know that the cycle of shallow relationships won’t cut it. They know that meaningful ideas deserve to endure and flourish. And when you’re armed with such ideas, traditional persuasion isn’t enough: You must catalyze others to dream right along with you.

In his book _Enchantment: The Art of Changing Hearts, Minds, and Actions,_ author and former chief evangelist for Apple, Guy Kawasaki defines enchantment as “the process of delighting people with a product, service, organization, or idea.” But it’s ethical, genuine enchantment that tempers cynics, sways hearts, changes minds, and forges an affinity with people that lasts.

The art of enchantment isn’t limited to just one kind of person or organization, either. Anyone can make enchantment happen anywhere, anytime. Apple uses enchantment to sweep the market with its innovative products. Zappos uses it to reinvent customer relationships. Even a Peace Corps volunteer has used it to disarm a hostile rebel group.

Capturing his experiences as both an entrepreneur and venture capitalist, Guy succinctly explains his observations and tactics gained over the years. However, he presents the prerequisites and the reasons why genuine enchantment can’t be faked.
