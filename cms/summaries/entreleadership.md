  ### What is this thing called EntreLeadership?


  > "EntreLeadership is defined as the process of leading to cause a venture to
  grow and prosper."- EntreLeadership, page 11


  What comes to mind when you think of a leader? Is it someone with integrity?
  Perhaps a visionary? It must be someone who is disciplined, right? How about a
  good listener?


  Now, what about when you think about an entrepreneur? Someone who is a risk
  taker? A person who is very driven? How about an avid learner?


  Dave makes the case that EntreLeaders are passionate servants, mavericks with
  integrity, disciplined risk takers, and ultimately, influential leaders. He
  makes the case that everything starts with the head of the organization.
  Ultimately the limit to what your organization accomplishes is you, its
  leader. John Maxwell calls this principle “the law of the lid”. He tells us
  that there is a lid on a person’s leadership ability, and this lid determines
  the level of effectiveness. The lower a person’s ability to lead, the lower
  the lid on his leadership ability and on his effectiveness is. I’ve
  highlighted two of the book’s leadership principles, dreaming and selling, in
  the Insights below.


  Oh, and let’s not confuse “having a position” with being a good leader. The
  first doesn’t mean the latter any more than the fact of having children means
  one is a good parent. It takes work. Serving your team by leading them well is
  like serving your children by parenting them well. Are you able to relate to
  this analogy?

  ### Selling by serving


  > "People don’t buy products and services, they buy what those products and
  services do."- EntreLeadership, page 180


  Have you ever heard that no money is made and nothing happens until someone
  sells and a sale is made? It’s true, and if you can make someone else feel the
  same way you do about a product or service, then you have “sold” them and they
  will buy the product or service. Everyday examples of this are when you read a
  great book or see a great movie, share your experience with someone else, and
  then they are able to experience the same thing you did.


  Dave shares the following four practical steps to lock in a sale:


  1.  Qualification

  2.  Rapport

  3.  Education/information

  4.  The close


  Failing to qualify a potential buyer is a huge mistake and taints the whole
  selling process. A qualified prospect has the money, time, need or want, and
  the authority to make the decision. Step 2, building rapport, is the same as
  building trust; like it or not, like my wife always says, first impressions do
  count. Do some research on the person you are going to meet; figure out their
  style and speak their language. Without establishing trust, there is no
  rapport. Therefore, a sale falls through. Regarding education or information,
  serve, don’t sell. Think of the last great server you had at a nice restaurant
  and the process they went through providing you all the information you needed
  to make your meal selection. Never try to sell someone something that you
  don’t believe in yourself; in other words, don’t drive a Toyota and try to
  sell Hondas! Closing the sale is effortless if you follow the first three
  steps. The prospect will buy readily because they are qualified, have rapport
  with you, and have all the information they need to make the decision.

  ### Start with a dream


  > "Dreaming is a sign you have hope. Dreaming is a sign you still think you
  can win. Dreaming keeps you young."- EntreLeadership, page 24


  The challenge that leaders face is converting their dreams to visions and then
  doing something about them. Andy Stanley states that you have to discuss the
  vision of your organization 21 times before people start to hear it! How many
  times have you consistently stated the vision of your organization to your
  team? As I write this, I am preparing for a 3-day working group comprised of
  about 20 people from all over the United States. As a result of learning this
  principle I will constantly find ways to communicate the vision of what we are
  trying to accomplish throughout the upcoming meeting.


  Dave challenges each leader to have a written personal mission statement and
  to include one’s skills and abilities (what), personality traits (how), and
  values, dreams, and passions (why) in it. Then he instructs to convert the
  vision and mission into action through specific goals in the specific areas:
  career, financial, spiritual, physical, intellectual, family, and social. The
  goals we set must be specific and measurable, not vague. Our goals must have a
  time limit, be written down and be our own, not someone else’s.


  EntreLeaders manage by objectives; that is, they get their team members to set
  goals as part of the overall objective of the organization. We fail when we
  allow an organizational culture to emerge in which team members don’t care
  about the organization’s goals but only about their own agendas. Ouch! The
  leader’s job is to constantly shine the light on the organization’s goals and
  to remove any distractions.
f_conclusion: >-
  Although not a business owner myself, I really enjoyed EntreLeadership and the
  style in which it was written. It informs the reader about the daily mechanics
  of starting and running a business along with high level leadership strategies
  that can be applied in any organization. Are you ready to be an EntreLeader?

> "You can win in business and have a blast doing it." _\- EntreLeadership, page 2_

From _New York Times_ bestselling author and nationally syndicated talk radio host Dave Ramsey comes the inside story of how he grew a multi-million dollar company from a card table in his living room.

Dave’s premise is that your company or organization is only as strong as your leadership. Your team will never grow beyond you, so here’s an important question to consider: Are you growing? Whether you’re sitting at the CEO’s desk, in the middle manager’s cubicle, or at a card table in your living-room-based startup, _EntreLeadership_ provides practical, step-by-step guidance to grow your business or organization to where you want it to go.
