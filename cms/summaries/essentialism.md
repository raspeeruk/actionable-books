  ### Less But Better


  > "Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it’s about how to
  get the right things done. It doesn’t mean just doing less for the sake of
  less either. It is about making the wisest possible investment of your time
  and energy in order to operate at your highest point of contribution by doing
  only what is essential."- Essentialism, page 5


  So what exactly is essentialism? The author defines it best as “a discipline
  you apply each and every time you are faced with a decision about whether to
  say yes or whether to politely decline. It’s a method for making the tough
  trade-offs between lots of good things and a few really great things. It’s
  about learning how to do less but better so you can achieve the highest
  possible return on every precious moment in your life.”


  How many of the tasks that get added to our to-do lists are absolutely vital?
  McKeown believes that by focusing on fewer pursuits, we can concentrate our
  energies on those with the biggest influence and increase our happiness and
  productivity. It’s about continuously asking, “Am I investing in the right
  activities?”


  The key idea is eliminating the non-essential to make time for what is
  important. Focusing on what’s vital starts with choosing how to spend our time
  and energy.

  ### Make time to escape and explore life


  > "The prevalence of noise: Almost everything is noise, and a very few things
  are exceptionally valuable. This is the justification for taking time to
  figure out what is most important. Because some things are so much more
  important, the effort in finding those things is worth it."- Essentialism,
  page 20


  Scheduling time to focus and reflect is hugely beneficial in figuring out what
  the best use of our resource should be. The purpose of choosing and making
  trade-offs is so we can focus and concentrate on our highest priorities. That
  is the ultimate aim of an essentialist.


  McKeown believes in the importance of “deliberately setting aside
  distraction-free time in a distraction-free space to do absolutely nothing
  other than think. We need space to escape in order to discern the essential
  few from the trivial many.” Only once we’ve cleared our mind of the clutter
  can we focus on what our biggest contribution will be.


  What’s important now? Can you confidently answer that question and feel like
  you’re working on the most meaningful priority in your life? In order to make
  essential choices in our lives, we have to ask the right questions. We can
  only ask the right questions when we’ve taken the time to pause and reflect
  what we really want in our lives.

  ### Exercise the power of choice


  > "If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will."- Essentialism, page
  10


  Our options are not always within our control but our ability to select among
  them is. Choosing how to spend our energy and time is difficult because it
  involves trade-offs and that means saying no to something. “The reality is,
  saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several
  others. We can either make our choices deliberately or allow other people’s
  agenda to control our lives.”


  So how do we go about having the courage to make better choices about what we
  do with our precious time and energy? Our first task should be to increase our
  level of comfort with saying no. It is not a rejection of the relationship,
  but merely a dismissal of the demand or request being asked of us. When we say
  no, we’re saying no to the request and not the relationship.


  He also advocates following the 90 per cent rule, which entails only saying
  yes to the top ten percent of opportunities. It involves identifying a set of
  critical criteria or attributes and assigning a score between 0 and 100. The
  only opportunities pursued would be those that score a 90 and above,
  disregarding everything else.


  It is easier to say no when you know what you want. Scheduling time to figure
  out what we want is one of the key themes to leading an essentialist life.
f_conclusion: >-
  There is a mistaken belief that we can have it all and multi-task our way to
  efficiency and productivity. McKeown makes a clear distinction between
  multi-task and multi-focus. While we can text and eat, or check email and
  clear our desk, we cannot concentrate on two things at once; we can only focus
  on one thing at a time.

  saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the

> "Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter." _\- Essentialism, page 10_

In a hyper-connected world filled with endless opportunities to pursue, Greg McKeown’s approach in _Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less_ provides a roadmap to help focus our energies on high-impact activities.

Following his essentialist dream, McKeown left law school to pursue a career of teaching and writing. He started his own leadership and strategy company, guiding individuals and companies to focus on the most critical priorities. The end result of his willingness to pursue his highest contribution is this book, which describes a blueprint for taking back control and directing our lives to make the most meaningful impact.
