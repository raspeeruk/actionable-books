  ### High performance is built on a process


  > "The four pillars of that platform are Mindset, Nutrition, Movement, and
  Recovery. Since every day is game day, you must: Prepare for It. (Mindset)
  Fuel for It. (Nutrition) Train for It. (Movement) Rest for It. (Recovery)"-
  Every Day is Game Day, page 5


  This process governs for both training and performance, practice days and game
  days. The better you work the process during practice or off-season, the
  better you will be on game day.


  The book applies this process to your physical training. And, if you need to
  get moving, I recommend it as an athletic training manual.


  The process is really not much different than it might be for, say, project
  management. You have to prepare for it. Get clear on goals. Have the right
  attitude. Gather the right people on the team. You must fuel for it. What
  resources do you need? Are there other ways to think about what you need
  besides just a budget? You’ll have to train for it, and do the actual work.
  Just like an athlete can enhance their movements and technique, so a manager
  can improve his skill as he gains experience and does the work. And, you will
  need to rest for it. That is, if you plan to do another project. The recovery,
  evaluation, learning and regrouping can make the next project even more
  successful. At some level a game or a project will be a failure if you don’t
  recover and learn from it.

  ### Recovery sustains high performance


  > "If you go through the effort to train and move your body and don’t take
  measures to repair it, you’ve wasted your workout."- Every Day is Game Day,
  chapter 4


  It is very significant that one quarter of the process of high performance is
  recovery. Very few hard-workers I know would assign one quarter of their
  attention to rest—the lazy people might! Rest, stretching, nutrition, and
  sleep all play a part in recovery.


  Maybe because I am older I notice I need more down-time than I used to. Not
  only am I less resilient physically, emotionally I’m not as flexible either.


  They recommend eating shortly after a workout. Stretching and balance
  exercises are part of an on-going injury prevention plan. Sleep is
  indispensable for high performance. Again, they are talking to athletes.


  I have worked at the same job now for over 25 years. I have some idea of how
  to sustain a long-term career. It does have to do with recovery. Take your
  vacation. Separate work and home so that you can go home with some energy to
  serve your family. Recover first. Don’t take your fatigue out on the people
  you love. Find people who energize you and spend time with them. Much of the
  productivity literature you will read recommends batching work and taking
  breaks, even power naps during the day. Recovery is a key, if not _the_ key to
  long term high performance.

  ### Fuel up, don’t diet


  > "Think of yourself as fueling throughout the day instead of sitting for
  three big meals."- Every Day is Game Day, chapter 2


  The second pillar of high performance is fueling. I have always resisted
  investing much time and/or attention to eating because food was either a means
  of enjoyment or something to avoid in order to lose weight. My mom was into
  diet fads. I remember consuming spoonfuls of cod liver oil as a kid with the
  promise that it was good for me. So I purposefully avoid getting too uptight
  about my diet.


  As a result, I’m tempted to treat what I learned here as a metaphor for work
  or business, but this part of _Game Day_ is good enough to treat it as it is
  written.


  _Every Day is Game Day_ contains Insights I’ve never seen elsewhere with
  respect to food. Think of it as fueling, not eating. “Think brown and close to
  the ground.” This is a mantra to help you choose carbohydrates. “The fewer
  legs the better.” When thinking about protein, choose meat from animals with
  the fewest legs. Of course, fish have no legs. Chickens have two. That’s a
  good place to start. You need one gram of protein for every pound of body
  weight.


  They recommend paying close attention to the effect food has on your body and
  energy level. I’ve started taking nuts to work to use as a mid-morning snack.
  This wards off hunger and prevents me from eating so much at lunch that I get
  sleepy in the afternoon.


  Staying hydrated and choosing what you drink is also important. They recommend
  you drink 1/2 to 1 ounce of fluid per pound per day, but, as they say, don’t
  drink your calories. They also assert that alcohol is not part of a
  high-performance lifestyle. But take heart, they are up for caffeine!

  The science of high performance has come a long way since I was an athlete. I
  wish I knew then what I know now. I wish I knew then what is between the
  covers of _Every Day is Game Day_.

  a career."

> "Anyone can hit excellence for a day, even a week or a month. That’s easy. But a high performer is one who does it consistently for years over the course of a career." _\- Every Day is Game Day, page 1_

In a previous life, I was a wrestler. That meant that every moment of every day I lived with a view to match day. I ran, cut weight, studied, practiced, slept, did homework with a view to competition. I only wished that every day was game day. I wish I knew then what Mark Verstegen and Pete Williams’ _Every Day is Game Day_ teaches.

On one hand, because of my background, it makes sense to me that a guide to high performance on an athletic field could hold promise for high performance in the rest of life. On the other hand, I had never thought to approach my work-life with any kind of athletic intensity.

While I still love to play anything with a ball on my free time – work is work. Sitting around. Writing. Walking down the hall. Attending meetings. Nothing inherently athletic. Nothing that would make one think of “Game Day.”

_Every Day is Game Day_ reminded me that I do all my work with my body, just like an athlete. The only work tool I really possess is me. I can try to cram more into a calendar or to-do list, get a smarter phone or a faster computer. But, if I underperform, all these other tools will fail to deliver the results I need.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### High performance is built on a process

This process governs for both training and performance, practice days and game days. The better you work the process during practice or off-season, the better you will be on game day.

While it may be too late for the book to help you compete on an athletic field, it is just in time to help you compete at work. You don’t just play on Friday nights any longer.

The reality is this: The better your body performs, the better you will perform. Don’t let yourself go. After all, every day is game day!
