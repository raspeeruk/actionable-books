  ### It’s All About the People!


  > "In the end, it is about truly caring for every precious human being whose
  life we touch."- Everybody Matters, page 15


  To start, their vision statement calls for them to measure their success by
  the way they touch the lives of others. Their approach to transformation,
  rejuvenation and renewed growth has been proven to create tremendous
  shareholder value in dozens of companies in different industries and cultures
  globally. The key pillars of their approach include:


  1.  Establish a shared long-term vision

  2.  Foster a people-centric culture

  3.  Develop leaders from within

  4.  Send people home fulfilled


  It is about living with an abundance mentality; abundance of patience, love,
  hope and opportunity.


  They share seven universal principles that can guide any team:


  1.  Every human being matters and is unique.

  2.  Evolution has a purpose.

  3.  The most powerful energy in the universe, and thus in human beings and in
  organizations, is caring.

  4.  The more we can combine work and caring, the more fulfilled we will be and
  the further we will collectively advance.

  5.  Individuals can choose to operate at a higher plane of consciousness or
  not.

  6.  Organizations can be built for resilience and inspired to care.

  7.  This is a journey with no end point.


  Leaders learn to inspire people to solve problems rather than trying to manage
  them out of problems. Offering and developing deep trust is the essential
  foundation of great leadership. And this is built on respect and caring which
  replaces the typical fear and anxiety often felt at work.

  ### Leadership Checklist


  > "When we engage our heads, hearts and hands around these habits,
  extraordinary levels of trust and fulfillment will result."- Everybody
  Matters, page 141


  Being a good leader means choosing to be a good steward of the lives entrusted
  to you. Not just your people, but the families they go home to at the end of
  the day, either surly and drained or happy and fulfilled.


  We all know that pilots follow checklists religiously. Thank goodness. Just
  like pilots, leaders are entrusted with precious lives every day. Chapman and
  Sisodia decided leaders too need checklists! So they took their vision and
  made it tangible. What must a leader DO every day? Here is their list. How
  many can you check off today?


  1.  I practice stewardship of the Guiding Principles of Leadership through my
  time, conversations and personal development.

  2.  I advocate safety and wellness through my actions and words.

  3.  I reflect to lead my team in achieving principled results on purpose.

  4.  I aspire to passion, optimism and purpose.

  5.  My personal communication cultivates fulfilling relationships.

  6.  I foster a team community in which we are committed to each other and to
  the pursuit of a common goal.

  7.  I exercise responsible freedom, empowering each of us to achieve our
  potential.

  8.  I proactively engage in the personal growth of individuals on my team.

  9.  I facilitate meaningful group interactions.

  10.  I set, coach to, and measure goals that define winning.

  11.  I recognize and celebrate the greatness in others.

  12.  I commit to daily continuous improvement.

  ### Create the Culture


  > "Most businesses use people to build products and make money; we use our
  products to build people."- Everybody Matters, page 123


  Do you consider the purpose of your business to maximize profits/shareholder
  value? The authors teach that this simplistic idea can damage the people and
  the business outcomes. It actually impairs the ability of the organization to
  sustainably generate value.


  Great leaders of truly great businesses think differently. The purpose of
  every great business is something deeper and involves having a positive impact
  on the world and on the lives of people.


  Bottom line, **if you create and run a business with the primary intention of
  driving profits and maximizing shareholder value, you will not be as
  successful as if your primary intention is to serve others.**


  To ensure they have the right emphasis at Barry-Wehmiller, they do two kinds
  of visioning; business visioning and cultural visioning. Culture equals values
  plus behavior. Cultural visioning focuses on their “why” and the values and
  behaviors that support it. Among other things, they ask how they should treat
  each other so they go home fulfilled.


  Where is your emphasis? I work with Pharma companies and encourage them to
  “serve patients by making medicines” rather than “make medicines to serve
  patients.”

  So how do you start? It starts with caring for the people you lead. How? Never
  look at the people you have the privilege of leading as a function (a sales
  rep, a receptionist). Rather, see them as a full human being: someone’s
  precious child, adored mother, beloved spouse. Think of them with infinite
  potential that you have the opportunity to profoundly impact. Listen to them
  deeply, inspire them to share their gifts fully and celebrate their journey.

  us their heads and hearts for free if we’d only known how to ask.”

> “We’ve paid people for their hands for years, but they would’ve gladly given us their heads and hearts for free if we’d only known how to ask.” _\- Everybody Matters, page 177_

What if there was a better way to do business? A way to make it, well, more fun? Bob Chapman and Raj Sisodia wrote this book to show the world that business **can** be done a better way. They started out as leaders who put profit before people, who always thought about costs, never about caring. Eventually they realized it is all about the people. They learned that great leadership, truly “human leadership,” brings our deepest sense of authentic caring and high ideals to business. And it is much different than the leadership they learned about in business school!

Their transformation began with the simple idea to make work more fun. From there they shaped a culture that’s being emulated nationally and even worldwide. Their culture is full of **caring,** **recognition,** **celebration,** and, as they say “holding up the goodness in people”. They discovered that the more they searched and shone a light on the goodness, the more they found.

They share the wisdom they gleaned successfully leading Barry-Wehmiller for forty years. They were able to pare down that wisdom to just two words: _Everybody matters_. They realized that when you treat people superbly and pay them fairly, you can not only compete globally but also enrich and elevate the lives of everyone the business touches.

How? Below are just three ideas they share. They don’t just want to help leaders in every field, they want to create a revolution. They want us all to use their discoveries to lead lives of meaning and fulfillment for ourselves and those we impact with our leadership.

So how do you start? It starts with caring for the people you lead. How? Never look at the people you have the privilege of leading as a function (a sales rep, a receptionist). Rather, see them as a full human being: someone’s precious child, adored mother, beloved spouse. Think of them with infinite potential that you have the opportunity to profoundly impact. Listen to them deeply, inspire them to share their gifts fully and celebrate their journey.

You don’t have to wait for your organization to decide this is the path forward. You, in your decisions each day, can do the right thing. You can pause each day to really listen to a colleague. Show them what they do matters.

Everybody truly does matter. Such a simple yet powerful idea. You already have within you what you need to start living the universal truth that everybody matters. How will you show people today that you care?
