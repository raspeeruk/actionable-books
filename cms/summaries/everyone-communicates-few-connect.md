  ### Finding the fertile common ground


  > "When I want to really get to know someone, I ask three questions. What do
  you dream about? What do you sing about? What do you cry about?"- Everyone
  Communicates, Few Connect, page 146


  Just like cultivating a garden, there are techniques the author offers to
  develop a common ground mindset in our communication. Carelessly throwing some
  vegetable seeds on the untilled surface of my backyard will not yield the
  healthful contents for my family’s salad bowl. It takes time and effort to
  break up the ground, to arrange the various seeds or seedlings, to guard
  against weeds and pests, to water when there is no rain, to prune for
  increased yield. In the same way, connection through communication does not
  materialize out of thin air. We must be willing to show up and choose to spend
  time with others.


  In the gardening world, the natural “green thumbs” seem to go about the
  growing business with relative ease and to know intuitively how to go about
  it. For those endowed with other colored thumbs, it may require more sweat
  equity and a concrete list of steps to follow to be able to garner a similar
  yield. Fortunately, fruit will be there for harvesting at the end of the
  season. It is no different in the world of communication. Engaging with others
  seems to come naturally for extroverts. However, for those of us who are
  introverts, it will require some extra effort.


  Really listening is an important technique on our way to finding common ground
  with others. Asking questions and then really listening to the answers
  demonstrates our interest in others. The opposite of this is to assume we
  already know what others know, feel, and want, or worse yet, being arrogant or
  indifferent enough to think we don’t need or care to understand what others
  know, feel, or want.


  Other techniques to finding common ground on Maxwell’s list are:


  *   Looking for ways to thank others

  *   Being open and letting people into our lives by giving up control and
  allowing them to know what we know, feel, or want

  *   Genuinely caring about other people

  *   Being humble by thinking of ourselves less and thinking of others more

  *   Being adaptable by moving from our own world to theirs

  ### Keeping your communication simple


  > "While educators often take something simple and make it complicated,
  communicators take something complicated and make it simple"- Everyone
  Communicates, Few Connect, page 150


  In my position as a project manager for the Air Force, I present briefings on
  various subjects and projects. A rule that has worked well for me over the
  years is to constantly strive to simplify the complicated concepts and
  processes so I can make them accessible for the audience. I am not there to
  impress the people in the room but to transfer information and to help make
  things understandable. As a result of keeping things simple, I have been able
  to clearly communicate information and have been told several times that I was
  the best briefer during an event. I believe striving to help the audience
  understand the information is the reason for this positive feedback. It makes
  me feel fulfilled when I have successfully communicated and transferred
  information to the audience.


  John Maxwell also recommends using humor, heart, hope and help when
  communicating with others. Humor is something that will make the audience
  laugh and put them in a receptive mood. Heart will captivate people’s emotions
  and get them engaged with your message. Hope will inspire the audience and
  move them toward an objective. Help is something that will assist the listener
  in some practical way as they listen and envision applying what you are
  sharing. How can you implement these four “h’s” in your next communication?

  ### Increasing your influence by connecting


  > "Connecting is the ability to identify with people and relate to them in a
  way that increases your influence with them"- Everyone Communicates, Few
  Connect, page 3


  It is not enough just to work hard and to do a great job; you have to learn
  how to communicate with others in the marketplace. This has been a tough
  lesson for me to learn. I have usually defaulted to prioritizing tasks over
  relationships with coworkers. As I reflect back on my career, I wish I had
  learned and implemented this principle years ago. My career would undoubtedly
  be better today if I had nurtured and maintained relationships along the way.


  The ability to connect with others starts with understanding the value of
  people. Successful people care about people as well as the work they do. They
  view subordinates optimistically and seek advice from them. The good news is
  that connecting with others has more to do with skill than with natural
  talent. It is something anyone can learn and it is never too late.
f_conclusion: >-
  As someone who desires to communicate well and to genuinely connect with
  others, I found this book very practical and helpful. By finding common ground
  with others, keeping my communication simple, striving to create enjoyable and
  interesting experiences, and staying authentic in my communication, I am
  confident that I will no longer just communicate but truly connect with
  others.

  "If I had to pick a first rule of communication - the practice above all
  others that opens the door to connection with others - it would be to look for
  common ground."

By finding common ground with others, keeping my communication simple, striving to create enjoyable and interesting experiences, and staying authentic in my communication, I am confident that I will no longer just communicate but truly connect with others.

John closes this book with the story of Moses from the Bible. He points out that initially Moses was not good with people, he was not a good communicator, and he was not a good leader. Moses took what ability he had, developed it, and made the most of it. What can you and I do with the talent we already have and with what we can develop by implementing the principles above? Now go connect!
