  ### Use Magic Words


  > "Magic Words are sets of words that talk straight to the subconscious brain.
  The subconscious brain is a powerful tool in decision-making because it is
  preprogrammed through our conditioning to make decisions without overanalyzing
  them."- Exactly What to Say, page 3


  For some of us, convincing another person to make a decision in our favor can
  often feel like pushing a rope. For others, the art of persuasion seems to
  come naturally. Jones provides some helpful insights into the power that words
  can have on the subconscious mind, and practical tips for using language to be
  more persuasive. Jones argues that your aim shouldn’t be to to move a person
  from “no” to “yes”—rather, you should focus on turning a “maybe” into a
  decision. The tips are deceptively simple: small tweaks to language that can
  easily be woven into any conversation. However, simple does not mean
  easy—changing our long-established speech patterns requires deliberate
  attention. And don’t fall into the trap of thinking that simple means small
  results—these tips and tricks could change everything about the way you get
  work done.


  You can use these magic words to guide and direct the conversation. A couple
  of my favorite magic word questions from the book are:


  How open-minded are you to \[result of using your service/offering\]?  

  What do you know about \[our business, what’s changed in the industry
  recently, etc.\]?  

  How would you feel if \[paint a picture of success\]?  

  When would be a good time \[to speak next, get started, etc.\]?

  ### Keep It Simple


  > "Roger realized he was doing everything wrong. He thought his obligation was
  to actually tell them how this stuff worked. He quickly realized his
  responsibility was not to give them _the_ answer; it was to give them _an_
  answer, so he changed the way he answered the question. From that point
  onward, when customers asked him, “So, how does all this stuff work?” he would
  respond with the words, “It works great.”"- Exactly What to Say, page 128


  For many people (myself included), there is a common urge to dig into the
  details—especially for those that consider themselves experts on a particular
  topic. The last time that I upgraded my cell phone, I encountered this
  problem—the salesperson launched right into the specs of the phone, and used a
  lot of words and terms that I didn’t understand. And to be honest, gave a lot
  of details that I didn’t really care about. I just wanted to make sure that it
  had enough storage for a bunch of music and could run the apps I use for work
  without draining the battery—I just wanted to know that it would work when I
  needed it.


  Especially for those selling technical products or services, big ticket items,
  or intangibles—the urge to dive right into details is strong. However, it’s
  often much more effective to resist the urge to geek out on the details, and
  keep responses at a very high level.


  Keep it simple: what is the outcome you’re trying to solve for? Remember that
  people typically make decisions based on feelings, with logic coming second.
  Keep your answers to questions as high-level as possible, and avoid the
  temptation to dive deep into the details. Nine times out of ten, your prospect
  just wants to know that you’re presenting a solution to their problem (and of
  course, for the tenth person, you should know what you’re selling or proposing
  like the back of your hand, so that you can provide the technical details they
  want—but treat that like the exception, not the rule).

  ### Just Imagine


  > "For a decision to come true, you must have first at least imagined yourself
  doing it. Have you ever been in a situation in which you have said, or even
  just mouthed, these words back to somebody else: “I just couldn’t see myself
  doing that”?"- Exactly What to Say, page 29


  There’s a reason that stories are about as old as humans. As a species, we are
  hardwired for narrative: stories help us understand the world around us,
  empathize with others, analyze the past, and make decisions for the future.


  Think back to the last time you accepted a new job, moved into a new house or
  apartment, or made a decision to change your life in a radical way. If you’re
  anything like me, you spent a lot of time imagining what your life would be
  like before you took action.


  When you want someone to make a decision in your favor, whether it’s to
  purchase a product, collaborate with you, or simply to agree with your point
  of view, invoking their imagination can be a powerful trigger. By asking a
  person to imagine what success looks like, you can encourage them to enter an
  imaginative (and thus highly receptive) state. As Jones argues, “when you hear
  the words, “Just imagine,” the subconscious brain kicks a switch and opens up
  the image viewer, and it cannot help but picture the very scenario you are
  creating” (30).


  Try this out at your next meeting. When you’re hoping to get a decision in
  your favor, use the sentence: “Just imagine… \[fill in the blanks of what
  success will look like\].”
f_conclusion: >-
  _Exactly What To Say_ is a small book that packs a big punch. You’ll want to
  keep it close by—it’s not one to read and then forget on your bookshelf.
  Practice your magic words daily. Try them out on different people and in
  different situations.

How much better would your life be if you were more persuasive?
