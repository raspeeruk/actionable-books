  ### Real Leaders Get Dirty


  > "Many people regard execution as detail work that’s beneath the dignity of a
  business leader. That’s wrong. To the contrary, it’s a leader’s most important
  job."- Execution, page 1


  Far from simply articulating a vision and parceling out work for subordinates
  to complete, the authors contend that it is a leader’s equal responsibility to
  both set direction and drive momentum in every aspect of their business – even
  if it takes them from formulating grand strategies to screwing in nuts and
  bolts, tweaking and fine-tuning operations designed to implement those very
  strategies. After all, only by serving in the trenches can you possibly begin
  to identify with, and understand the responsibilities of, the person you’re
  sending off to fight on your behalf.


  This was a lesson learnt and painstakingly implemented by Steve Jobs and Jamie
  Dimon. These two very different men, both from two strikingly different
  backgrounds, eventually ended up learning the same lesson from the ground-up;
  Jobs as he was soldering motherboards in his garage alongside fellow members
  of the Homebrew Computer Club, Dimon as he and his mentor Sandy Weill spent
  days and nights poring over spreadsheets and calculating ratios to identify
  the companies that they would one day take over and combine to build
  Citigroup.


  Wading into a ditch to do the work you’d rather have someone else do is
  humbling, and establishes a frame of mind that is focused on implementing
  solutions, leaving no problem unsolved, and looking for ways to simplify and
  minimize open-ended processes. All of these experiences are necessary
  components of the discipline of execution, and can be instrumental in the
  initial stages of setting up your new venture. A willingness to shoulder
  undesirable work and lead by example is a quality that is often over-promoted
  by many leaders but rarely exhibited in public.

  ### Seeing It In Action


  > "Putting an execution environment in place is hard, but losing it is easy."-
  Execution, page 3


  When Larry Bossidy joined Allied Signal as its CEO in 1991, he found that the
  three core processes of the company – people, strategy and operations – were
  each independently advanced, but thoroughly disconnected from one another.
  Although the business was staffed with smart, highly talented people, they
  were sequestered within the company’s various business units, each of which
  had its own distinct culture and functioned as a semi-autonomous subsidiary.


  Communication between the various business divisions was minimal and
  uncoordinated, which made it difficult for a single, unified business strategy
  to permeate across the company. Not everyone had the same view of the company
  and its priorities, nor did they necessarily understand and identify with any
  overarching strategy as it was articulated to them.


  Bossidy started out by firing people who hadn’t established a drive to succeed
  and a track record for generating results, thereby keeping and promoting only
  the best talent within the business (People). He then focused on breaking down
  the siloed culture within each of AlliedSignal’s business divisions by
  creating lines of communications that cut across departments, and encouraging
  and forcing people from different departments to work together in order to
  formulate solutions and unite the different business divisions under the
  AlliedSignal name.


  Once the entire organization was moving in unison, he focused on setting
  business priorities that required members from across the business to
  contribute and set accountability standards (Strategy). Projects were then
  designed with a specific focus in mind, and were constructed deliberately
  around the standards of accountability developed by the business leaders
  themselves. Results-oriented performance was strongly encouraged, recognized
  and rewarded; incompetence was stamped out ruthlessly (Operations).


  His strategy worked. In just 8 years AlliedSignal had successfully merged with
  Honeywell International, tripled its operating margins to nearly 15 percent,
  raised its return on equity from just over 10 percent to 28 percent, and had
  delivered an almost ninefold return for shareholders.

  ### The Bedrock of Your Church


  > "The three processes – people, strategy, and operations – remain the
  building blocks and heart of good execution. But as the economic, political,
  and business environments change, the ways in which they are carried out also
  change."- Execution, page 14


  Here’s how it breaks down: Whenever you’re bringing a group of **people**
  together, either to build a project team, staff a division or flesh out your
  executive branch, seek and hire only top talent. Don’t settle for “next-best
  alternatives”, “good enough” solutions or people who can just “get the job
  done”.


  In your quest for talent, be unreasonable, be demanding, and insist on only
  bringing on people who have demonstrated their worth and value to your
  endeavour. Anyone else is going to dilute your team’s capabilities.


  While **strategy** can be important in providing a sense of direction for your
  business, it is the really just that – a _sense_ of direction. It may provide
  some level of coordination between your team members and several different
  stakeholders, but it doesn’t solve the problems of execution on its own
  merits. It is just a tool, a set of organizing principles around which the
  leader coordinates the efforts of the people on her team. It can be a vision
  statement or a loose goal pegged for completion one year from now, but the
  real challenge will be to orient the skills, experiences and talents of the
  people on your team towards the end goal articulated by your strategy.


  Which brings us to the very definition of **operations** – the essential third
  component that bridges the gap between the people you have recruited and the
  direction set by your strategy.


  This term encompasses a whole swath of different things, from projects broken
  down into mini-projects, to progress meetings, deadline reviews, coffee
  breaks, drinks at the bar – anything that allows a leader to build and keep
  momentum going, but which also breaks down a high-level business strategy into
  specific, measurable goals and milestones that can be matched directly with
  the skillsets of the team and be made time-bound.


  As the authors often allude, very often a failure to execute stems from an
  inability to translate a strategy into concrete, actionable steps that are
  then given to the right people who can be held accountable to them.
f_conclusion: >-
  The discipline of _Execution_ works. Although this book may not introduce new
  concepts to the seasoned manager, its principles are sound and the examples
  thorough and illuminating. The challenge of creating and entrenching a culture
  of execution within your business may require you to get your hands dirty, but
  the process works and generates manifold rewards. Some people will suffer and
  fall by the wayside, but under the right leadership, only the best talent will
  be attracted to your business in order to orchestrate some of the most
  inspiring feats of business imagination that the world has yet to see.

So begins _Execution_, a crisp eye-opener of a book widely considered by many to be the best book written on a discipline that lies at very heart of success. And rightly so, because this book is the intellectual fruit of a collaboration between two of the last century’s finest business minds – Ram Charan, the highly sought-after management consultant and theorist, and Larry Bossidy, the award-winning and seasoned executive, moulded by more than thirty years of high-powered leadership at General Electric and AlliedSignal, and nearly a decade more as Chairman and CEO of Honeywell International.

Bossidy and Charan argue that the biggest pitfall facing businesses today is their inability to execute. Far from being unable to attract the brightest minds, innovate consistently or shave costs to reach a new zenith of efficiency, the slow decline and death of a business is often due to its inability to create an environment that encourages, recognizes and rewards the discipline of execution – the ability to coordinate human effort and generate outstanding results continuously, consistently and efficiently.
