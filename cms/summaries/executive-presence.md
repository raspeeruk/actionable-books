  ### The power of developing presence


  > "Your presence communicates your self-worth and confidence as well as the
  level of respect you have for others and the occasion."- Executive Presence,
  page 26


  There is something about your presence that sets you apart, that makes you
  some combination of brilliant, charismatic, empathetic, smooth, persuasive,
  strategic and full-on cool.


  Simon Cowell, of _American Idol_ fame, who possesses only a few of those
  attributes, refers to the latter criterion as the “it factor,” and by
  implication one can conclude that you have it or you don’t. Although that may
  be true in entertainment and athletics, the business and corporate world
  remains a place where, genetics aside, you can acquire and evolve the
  attributes of a CEO-level executive presence the old-fashioned way – you can
  learn them.


  Many of those in management haven’t learned how to leverage their assets by
  effectively representing themselves or communicating with others to the best
  of their abilities. You need to master a multitude of communication skills to
  create an _executive presence_ and reach the top in your field.


  These skills range from accurately reading people and predicting their
  behavior to subtly influencing the perceptions and behavior of those around
  you, from persuading those of opposing views to come over to your side to
  creating and maintaining a personal brand that broadcasts your positive
  reputation to a wide audience, and from managing and controlling your online
  reputation to performing effective damage control when things go wrong.

  ### How to communicate for maximum impact


  > "If awareness is your social radar, authenticity is playing to the social
  radar of others by being genuine, honest, and respectful. Phoniness and
  bluster, no matter how proficiently conveyed, are easy to spot and
  consistently off-putting on several levels. The concept of honesty goes beyond
  telling the truth; it embraces conveying the truth about yourself as well."-
  Executive Presence, page 26


  The collective memories, experiences, values, and beliefs of the person to
  whom you are delivering a message may seem to be a significant hurdle, and
  rightly so. That means your goal should not be so much to change people’s
  minds as to use their existing thought modeling to your advantage. In other
  words, the most effective approach is not to challenge the audience but to
  play to the audience. If you can make your pitch _about them_ and the effect
  that your content will have on their lives rather than _about you_ or your
  priorities, you may be able to end a belief system that seems less than
  pliable.


  You are left with two primary strategies. **First know your audience.** Do
  what you can to understand the way the members of the audience will filter
  your message, which includes biases and preconceptions that are firmly in
  place before you utter a word. Work toward understanding the underlying values
  and belief systems on which those biases and preconceptions are based. The
  more you speak their language – particularly in the terms of context and
  framing – the better off you’ll be when it is time to tell them something that
  challenges or stretches the status quo.


  All this falls into the category of content, and by now we’ve established that
  style occupies an equally high place in the hierarchy of effective
  communication. This means that the **nature of your delivery** is the second
  tool you must optimize, including the pace and tone of your words, the nature
  of your body language, and the visual presentation that packages it all.


  This book is an excellent guide for anyone aspiring to take their career and
  communication skills to higher levels. **With the right timing, delivery and
  with spin that optimizes your chances because you’ve done your homework,
  you’ll have given your message the best shot it can have at success.**


  Have you experienced the power of presence in your communications?

  ### The path to perception


  > "‘To each his own’ has never been truer than it is when it refers to the way
  people filter information."- Executive Presence, page 9


  We are at our core a society of pitchers. Pitching – the kind that pleads a
  case and asks for the order that wraps an agenda within a message and ties a
  neat bow of sincerity around it – is the very essence of commerce, the
  lifeblood of law and politics and romance, the fundamental stuff of human
  interaction.


  We pitch our qualifications at job interviews. We plead our case in courtrooms
  and at bars over drinks. We manage employees by pitching them our wisdom and
  our vision for the future. We are pitching when we sell, when we lobby, when
  we complain, and when we seek to be heard and understood, which for most of us
  happens each and every day.


  The common denominator is being understood. But all pitches, and more aptly
  all pitchers, are not created equal, and the most persuasive among us know
  something the rest of us don’t.


  Consistently successful communicators – whether they are sales professionals,
  politicians, lawyers, managers, parents, partners, or coaches – know how to
  manage and influence the way they are _perceived._ More than that, they
  understand that it is perception, not intention or even content that dictates
  the outcome of an agenda that resides at the heart of each and every pitch we
  make.


  The way we are perceived by those who experience what we say or do or even our
  mere presence is the product of a specific neurological process whose outcome
  can take any number of forms. Information is taken in by one or more of five
  sensory portals – the senses – and then is filtered or processed by a suite of
  specific mental mechanisms that assign meaning and nuance to what has arrived
  through the senses, each with very different criteria and experiential
  rationales.


  The line between input and output is anything but straight and is not remotely
  simple. **This is the source of our opportunity as communicators, because if
  we know what we are doing, we can be architects of that line.**

  "One of the most common phrases uttered about business: ‘It’s not what you
  know; it’s who you know.’ …this cliché isn’t quite on target, but if we adjust
  it to ‘it’s not only what you know but how you manage perception,’ we are
  taking the first steps on a life-altering journey."
