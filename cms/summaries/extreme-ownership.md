  ### Extreme Ownership


  > "The leader must own everything in his or her world."- Extreme Ownership,
  page 30


  Looking at leadership through the paradigm of “Extreme Ownership” makes a
  complex subject quite simple. In any organization, on any team, “all
  responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader”. This is one of
  those mindsets that “say easy but do hard”. We all have egos and none of us
  like to fail or fall below the line, however, it’s going to happen. The best
  leaders check their egos, accept blame, seek out constructive criticism and
  take detailed notes to improve individually and as a unit.


  It’s unfortunate how common and acceptable it is in business and society today
  to place blame elsewhere and say “that’s the reason we failed” or “it’s that
  person’s fault”, etc. Willink and Babin write, “The best leaders don’t just
  take responsibility for their job. They take Extreme Ownership of everything
  that impacts their mission. This concept is the number-one characteristic of
  any high-performance winning team, in any military unit, organization, sports
  team or business team in any industry”.


  What I found compelling is that, by a leader taking Extreme Ownership of their
  team and the situations the team encounters, they will actually increase their
  trust and credibility with their leadership team and their subordinates at an
  accelerated rate. When leaders set this precedent, this mindset of “Extreme
  Ownership” starts to permeate into the culture of the team and the
  organization. When this starts to happen, look out!

  ### Discipline Equal Freedom – The Dichotomy of Leadership


  > "Although discipline demands control and asceticism, it actually results in
  freedom"- Extreme Ownership, page 272


  Discipline defined is: strict order, regimen, and control. While that sounds
  like the complete opposite of freedom, Willink and Babin challenge us to look
  at discipline past the initial inconvenience of doing the task. They suggest
  that discipline is the pathway to freedom and is paramount to success for any
  leader, team and organization.


  Think about your team and the standard operating procedures that you have in
  place. Why do you have them? I would venture to guess it’s so that things get
  done in an efficient, effective manner, across the variance of people that may
  be responsible to accomplish a task. These standard procedures allows you to
  not have to reinvent the wheel every time this situation presents itself. By
  creating a culture of disciplined execution, it allows your organization to be
  more flexible, adaptable and ultimately more efficient. Now there is a balance
  between discipline and freedom and as a leader that balance must be identified
  and maintained but once you get it right, you open up the opportunity for
  success within that setting.


  Jocko and Leif also share with us a list of leadership dichotomies that must
  be carefully balanced. A good leader must be:


  *   Confident but not cocky

  *   Courageous but not foolhardy

  *   Competitive but a gracious loser

  *   Attentive to details but not obsessed by them

  *   Strong but have endurance

  *   A leader and a follower

  *   Humble not passive

  *   Aggressive not overbearing

  *   Quiet not silent

  *   Calm but not robotic, logical but not devoid of emotions

  *   Close with the troops but not so close that one becomes more important
  than another or more important than the good of the team; not so close that
  they forget who is in charge


  “A good leader has nothing to prove, but everything to prove,” they say.

  ### No bad teams, only bad leaders


  > "Whether a team succeeds or fails is all up to the leader. The leader’s
  attitude sets the tone for the entire team. The leader drives performance – or
  doesn’t."- Extreme Ownership, page 49


  The title of this insight captures the very nature of what Extreme Ownership
  is all about. “This is a difficult and humbling concept for any leader to
  accept,” the authors write. “But it is an essential mind-set to building a
  high performance winning team”.


  As a leader, you must take full ownership of the standards of your team. Any
  leader knows all too well how difficult this can be but when it comes to these
  standards, as the leader, _“it’s not what you preach, it’s what you
  tolerate”_.


  No matter what those standards are, no matter if they are written or spoken,
  if team members are falling below that line and aren’t being held accountable
  to that precedent, then that poor performer/performance becomes the new
  standard. To put it bluntly, leaders must enforce their expected standards.


  “A leader must find a way to become effective and drive high performance
  within his or her team in order to win,” the authors advise. “Whether in SEAL
  training, in combat on distant battlefields, in business or life: there are no
  bad teams, only bad leaders”.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are thousands of books out there about leadership and while many are
  great, few I’ve read are as practical, actionable and frankly emotionally
  moving as _Extreme Ownership_. _Extreme Ownership_ is a mind-set, an attitude,
  and the authors do an incredible job of laying a foundation for both in this
  book. I’ll leave with you the last paragraph from the book as I feel it is so
  appropriate…

_Extreme Ownership_ is about the principles of leadership that are used within the US Navy Seals. This gem was written by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin, former Navy Seal officers for SEAL Task Unit Bruiser. Both are decorated combat veterans who now run a leadership training and consulting firm called Echelon Front. The book was written with the belief that “how Navy SEALs train and prepare their leaders, how they mold and develop high-performance teams, and how they lead in combat – are directly application to success in any group, organization, corporation, business, and, to a broader degree, life”.

The principles that are taught and discussed throughout the book are told through incredible stories and lessons from Willink and Babin’s experience leading combat troops in the battle of Ramadi. They then break down, examine and discuss each leadership principle individually, and, finally, share these principles from client examples of how they show up in the business world.

You’ll not only gain appreciation and respect for what these men did in combat, but you’ll learn practical and actionable leadership principles to help you succeed in your leadership role!

I’ll leave with you the last paragraph from the book as I feel it is so appropriate…

“While there is no guarantee for success in leadership, there is one thing that is certain: leading people is the most challenging, and, therefore, the most gratifying undertaking of all human endeavors. So, with that humbling reward in the distance, embrace the burden of command and go forward onto your battlefield, in whatever arena that may be, with the disciplined resolve to take Extreme Ownership, lead, and win”.
