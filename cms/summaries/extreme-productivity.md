  ### Three simple, but powerful, ideas


  > "Let’s begin with what I mean by ‘personal productivity.’ I mean the
  quantity and quality of your results in achieving your own objectives."-
  Extreme Productivity, page XII


  Pozen’s formula for boosting your productivity and improving your performance
  centers on the application of three fundamental ideas:


  1\. Articulate your goals and rank them in order of priority. (I write
  specifically about how to do this in insight #1.)


  2\. Keep your focus on the final product.


  3\. Don’t sweat the small stuff. In other words, spend your time on what is
  most important to you and find ways to simplify and spend as little time as
  possible on lower-priority items.

  ### The Magic of Routine


  > "Try to keep as much of your daily routine as simple and automatic as
  possible. That allows you to spend more time on your work, family, and
  friends, and it helps you avoid fatigue."- Extreme Productivity, page 59


  When you take time in the morning to decide what you want to wear, you are
  wasting time that could be spent doing something related to your top
  priorities. This is also true of time you spend figuring out where to go and
  what to order for lunch everyday. Pozen’s solution to this is to routinize
  these items and as much of his day as possible, thus eliminating time and
  mental energy wasted on making choices. For example, he eats the same things
  for breakfast every day (a banana and a bowl of Cheerios or Life), opts for a
  chicken salad sandwich on whole wheat bread with a diet soda in his office for
  lunch unless there is a specific reason for eating out (such as recruiting a
  new employee or networking with colleagues) and, taking a cue from President
  Obama, he limits his wardrobe choices to either a blue or gray suit (he has
  five summer and five winter suits) and shirts and ties that his wife assures
  him go with the suits.


  Although I’m probably not as extreme as Pozen, I have targeted areas of my
  life that I consider mundane and have simplified them. For example, like many
  male corporate employees, during the warmer months I wear the same color
  slacks (khaki) and short-sleeved polos of various colors (any color goes with
  khaki, right?) When I wake up in the morning I can pretty much mindlessly grab
  slacks and any polo shirt and I’m good to go. I won’t win any fashion awards,
  but then, winning one of these awards is not one of my top priorities. I have
  also routinized my breakfast on workdays, saving variety and satisfying my
  taste buds for the weekend when I have the time to indulge in something
  different.

  ### Get clear on what matters most


  > "To be productive, you need to articulate your goals clearly and prioritize
  them."- Extreme Productivity, page 18


  In the first chapter of _Extreme Productivity_ Pozen takes us step-by-step
  through the process of listing relevant goals (i.e. our personal and career
  goals AND the goals of those to whom we report) and then prioritizing them. He
  recommends doing this once a year and then using the results to help you focus
  your energy for the rest of the year.


  There are six steps to Pozen’s process:


  1. **Write everything down** – Take out one or two sheets of paper and write
  down all of your career-related duties. Then, add short-term and long-term
  goals (things you want to do) and aspirations you have for work.


  2. **Organize by time horizon** – Divide your list into three time categories:
  Career Aims (5+ years), Objectives (3 – 24 months), and Targets (1 week or
  less). Pozen recommends that you have at least one or two Targets associated
  with each Objective.


  3. **Rank your Objectives** – In this step, Pozen recommends that you attend
  to both supply (things that you want to do and things that you are good at)
  and demand (things that the world, your organization, or your boss need from
  you) as you rank your Objectives from highest to lowest priority. The
  importance of acknowledging “demand” should be obvious. If your boss wants
  something done and it’s something that supports the strategy of your
  organization, then it needs to be at or near the top of your priority list –
  if keeping your job is important to you.


  4\. **Rank your Targets** – First, divide your Targets into two categories:
  Enabling Targets (those that help you accomplish your Objectives) and Assigned
  Targets (things that your boss and boss’s boss have given you.) For your
  Enabling Targets, Pozen suggests that you consider which Objective(s) they
  support and how effectively they advance your Objectives. For your Assigned
  Targets, he suggests that you consider who created the Target, its implied
  importance, and its overall importance.


  5\. **Estimate how you actually spend your time** – With the exception of
  professions that bill by the hour (e.g. attorneys and consultants), most
  people never take the time to really record how they are spending their time.
  To get a better grasp of how you might really be using your time, Pozen
  suggests answering three questions regarding your current work schedule and
  three regarding your work schedule as you expect it to be next year.


  6\. **Address the mismatch between priorities and time spent** – The next step
  involves comparing your time estimate to your prioritized list of Objectives
  and Targets. If the mismatch seems large, don’t lose heart. Pozen asserts that
  most professionals spend no more than half of their time on their highest
  priorities.


  7\. **Fix the mismatch** – The last step involves the creation of a tiered
  to-do list that focuses your time and energy on your priorities. At the top of
  the list you write your highest priority Objectives and Targets with precise
  deadlines for completion. At the bottom of the page you write your lower
  priority items with rough estimates of when you’d like to finish each of them.
  Once you’ve created this two-tiered to-do list, Pozen recommends that you
  check and make adjustments to it each day. Then, on the weekend complete a
  detailed review of your list and make adjustments as you see fit.


  Completing these six steps takes time, but I promise you that it will be time
  well spent. I found it difficult to complete all the steps in one sitting, so
  it probably took me longer to complete than you might need (i.e. It took me
  several 20 minute sittings over four days in a local coffee shop.) Once I
  finished the initial process, however, I found that it helped me focus and get
  more done. Now, at the end of a week, I also feel a greater sense of
  accomplishment than I did when I allowed others “orders” and “requests”
  dictate how I spent my time.

  I like many of the suggestions that Pozen makes for increasing productivity,
  but am not so sure about one of them in particular. In the chapter titled,
  “Don’t Sweat the Small Stuff,” Pozen states that “. . . especially with
  colleagues, it is socially acceptable to multitask.” I’m curious, how would
  you feel if one of your colleagues chose to respond to email or text messages
  while talking with you?

> "Success depends a large part on a proper mind-set: focusing on the results you plan to achieve, rather than the number of hours you work." _\- Extreme Productivity, page XII_

Have you ever marveled at the productivity of some business executives and wondered how they managed to get so much done AND maintain a healthy family life (let alone, their sanity)? And, have you ever wished that you could get some face-time with one of these business executives to learn their secrets of productivity? If so, then you’ll want to read about Robert C. Pozen’s guide to being productive, _Extreme Productivity: Boost Your Results, Reduce Your Hours_.

Pozen is the former chairman of MFS Investment Management and is currently a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute. Over the years, he managed to serve on many of the boards of local charities and public companies, author six books, write hundreds of articles and raise a family with his wife of more than four decades. His own productivity record eminently qualifies him to advise the rest of us on how to be extremely productive.

_Extreme Productivity_ is for those who want to be productive at work, but do not necessarily aspire to launching an online business. It’s a guide to being as focused and productive as possible at work so that you can have a more successful career and more time to spend with family and friends.
