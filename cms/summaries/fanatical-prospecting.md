  ### The Case for Prospecting


  > "There is no easy button in sales. Prospecting is hard, emotionally draining
  work, and it is the price you have to pay to earn a high income."- Fanatical
  Prospecting, page 7


  So why write a book on prospecting? Well, for the most part, anyone who has a
  corporate job is directly impacted by the ability of your company to acquire
  business. If your sales people aren’t able to do that, the people in HR,
  accounting and IT are going to be out of a job. And as anyone that has been in
  sales for even for one day knows, the most difficult part of the sales
  process, without a doubt, is PROSPECTING!


  From his years of experience in sales the author says, “Lots of sales people
  possess the drive, talent and hunger to succeed. Lots of sales people have the
  intelligence, talent skills and education to be top performers. Yet they
  consistently underperform the superstars.” Why is that you ask? The number one
  reason sales professionals struggle or flat out fail is the inability to add
  qualified prospects and opportunities into their pipeline.


  Jeb Blount gives us very detailed and actionable items to focus on in order to
  improve in these areas. At a high-level, he says, “in sales, business, and
  life, there are only three things you can control”:


  1.  Your actions

  2.  Your reactions

  3.  Your mindset


  Our ability, as sales professionals, to be great at prospecting, will afford
  us, our company and those that we work with the ability to provide for
  ourselves, families and others.

  ### Developing Mental Toughness


  > "You must deliver results or you will be fired."- Fanatical Prospecting,
  page 245


  The quote above is the harsh reality of the sales profession. The author says
  that “sales professionals are the elite athletes of the business world” and
  that’s exactly how we have to think of ourselves. Again, your company and the
  people that work there rely on you for their jobs and their paychecks and if
  over time you don’t produce for them, they will find someone who does.


  Jeb talks a lot about the only things we can control in our lives: our
  actions, our reactions, and our mindset. These are magnified when it comes to
  individuals in sales. During this chapter, we take a deep dive into what
  Blount calls the “Four Pillars of Mental Toughness in Sales”:


  *   Desire

  *   Mental resilience

  *   Outlearn = outlearn

  *   Physical resilience


  We have to make a concerted effort to relentlessly continue to get better at
  our craft. We have to keep our mental edge and attitude sharp, we have to keep
  learning and growing our knowledge base and our technique. The moment we get
  complacent, someone else is right on your coattail to steal your client or
  take your business.

  ### The Four Objectives of Prospecting


  > "Prospecting is not for building relationships, selling or chatting up your
  buyer."- Fanatical Prospecting, page 73


  This chapter in Fanatical Prospecting is gold and a foundational element to
  success in sales. Before we jump into any kind of sales activity (in this case
  – prospecting), we need to get clear on what our objective is for that action.
  The author walks us through the “four core prospecting objectives”. They are:


  *   Set an appointment

  *   Gather information and qualify

  *   Close a sale

  *   Build familiarity


  “The bottom line is,” Blount writes, “if you don’t have a plan and you don’t
  know your objectives, your prospecting blocks will be far less effective and
  you will waste time.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Sales is such a fun profession to be in. You have the opportunity to build
  relationships and work with great people, learn about different businesses and
  be rewarded for all of your hard work. It’s also one of the most difficult
  things to do in the world. Having a guide and resource like _Fanatical
  Prospecting_ is such a strong asset for anyone in sales or leadership.
