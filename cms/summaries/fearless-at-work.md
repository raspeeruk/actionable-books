  ### It’s all about the fundamentals


  > "Fearlessness stays present, and that’s what these fundamental habits are
  about. The here and now. By recognizing the moment that you are in and its
  potential, you can begin to create profound changes in the way you think and
  act."- Fearless At Work, page 15


  The key to success is realizing that even the smallest of changes can lead to
  greater results. Fletcher continually highlights how simple choices in
  thinking can lead to major shifts in outcome and provides examples from her
  own personal experience, as well as from the experiences of many of her
  clients. The book focuses on 10 habits or patterns she has identified. For
  each of these she provides a series of “trades,” where if you exchange a
  current behavior for an alternative, it will lead to positive outcomes.


  The 5 fundamental trades are the basic habits that influence everything –
  making a change here can lead to significant progress and lead to the largest
  impact.


  1.  **Trade Defensiveness for Curiosity** – here the goal is to ask “what
  if…?” and find a way to push yourself out of trying to protect your own
  narrative, and find new solutions.

  2.  **Trade the Old Story for a New Story** – too often we live with fear,
  afraid to try new things and challenge ourselves, so here the goal is to
  eliminate the “but” and search for the new who, what, where, when, why and how
  to become what we truly want to be.

  3.  **Trade Bad Stress for Good Stress** – here the goal is to find those
  things that energize us, not wear us down and leverage this to focus on those
  things that excite us and avoid those that don’t.

  4.  **Trade Words for Action** – this is one of the most critically important
  elements, and the one that is so often underutilized. We spend time planning
  and talking about what we want, but do not spend enough time doing… we know
  what we want, but never truly define why we want it, and what it will take to
  make it happen… how and what don’t matter if we don’t know our “why.”

  5.  **Trade Comfort for Clarity** – we allow ourselves to be comfortable and
  this usually means we then try to _stay_ comfortable and fear of change stops
  us from growing. Finding clarity means asking questions to truly understand
  how we will get to what we want, our why, and what we are willing to
  sacrifice, or not, to achieve it.


  These essential elements are all linked together, and through working on them,
  trying to achieve a level of mastery will lead us to improvements in all areas
  of our lives. These trades will make the rest of what it takes to achieve
  fearlessness possible, because each of the future trades will be based on
  these fundamental choices.

  ### Embrace fear to make yourself better


  > "Fear can’t be eliminated, but we can work through it. You will achieve this
  by creating awareness of key moments and learning to trade a current behavior
  for a better one that builds fearlessness."- Fearless At Work, page 10


  Embracing fear is not ignoring its existence, or having a false sense of
  bravado—rather it is understanding what drives the fear, and then facing the
  reality and searching for alternatives that confront the negative behaviors
  and situations with more positive ones. Examples of trades that focus on this
  are intentional, such as trading scarcity for opportunity, trading urgency for
  simplicity, complacency for ingenuity, grudges for gratitude, complacency for
  ownership. In each of these examples, the author describes the differences and
  provides anecdotes that illustrate how to overcome them. The call to action is
  to understand that you can make conscious choices to confront the negative
  behaviors that are holding you back, and to search for better ways to live
  your values while still exhibiting leadership.

  ### Know who you are and what you stand for


  > "If you don’t have a clear purpose, you are more likely to sacrifice your
  time, energy, and resources to the desires of others and to stay in a place of
  passivity and fear."- Fearless At Work, page 13


  The key to success is in knowing what is important, what you value, and having
  that mission lead you in every decision you make. When there is alignment, you
  will find success. Fear and indecision come from making choices that go
  against our values, or call the goal into question, but when we have clarity
  of purpose, these moments are less frequent. Fletcher provides a few chapters
  where she discusses trading superficial behaviors such as insecurity, status,
  and entitlement for more beneficial behaviors such as authenticity, legacy,
  and humility; trading excuses, regret, and impulse for accountability,
  responsibility and self-discipline. These choices can only be made
  consistently when you have a clear understanding of your values, those of your
  organization, and your ultimate mission.
f_conclusion: >-
  With each chapter, this book provides a few trades where a simple shift in
  mindset can take you from crippled with fear to a growth mindset rich with
  fearlessness. Success is not dependent upon you alone, but rather in gaining
  alignment and support from those around you, co-workers, friends, and family
  through finding cheerleaders and creating your own tribe, that subscribes to
  the same set of values and your shared mission.

  inspire your purpose must be anchored within you to guide your reactions and
