  ### 100%-zero accountability


  > "In the model of 100%-zero accountability, it does not matter what others
  choose. Accountability is viewed as owning the problem or situation. It's
  irrelevant who is to blame or what caused the problem."- Fearless Leadership,
  page 150


  In the model of 100%-zero accountability there is no blame or guilt attached
  to any alleged issue or problem within a business. You are fully responsible
  for your actions and are not judgemental towards others’ behaviour nor
  expecting them to take accountability for their behaviour. The zero means
  there is no waiting for others to act.


  The central element in this approach is to have an entire organisation of
  committed partners wherein trust is granted early, is a requisite and remains
  transparent. You must be willing to accept responsibility where you have
  conspired against or not supported others and correct this behaviour, most
  importantly in yourself, but also stopping this behaviour in others.


  100%-zero accountability means listening for positive intention; they
  eliminate ambiguity by being absolutely honest and clear about your behaviour
  and immediate reactions.


  Achieving this is definitely not an easy task and requires considerable
  willpower. Several steps discussed below are worth considering:


  1.  Keeping an optimistic attitude and remaining positive despite fighting
  against your core values and belief systems, i.e. “it’s not my fault” versus
  taking responsibility.

  2.  Avoiding victim mentality. Move away from the 50-50 mentality of “I will
  do this if you do that” towards taking full responsibility, irrespective of
  other people.

  3.  Take a bold stance of achievement and reduce half-hearted commitments.

  4.  Allow yourself to speak up constructively, versus remaining silent. This
  will allow others to see you walking the walk. Also, openly discuss your blind
  spots and allow others to coach you.

  5.  Listen for positive intention instead of tuning out and making
  assumptions.

  6.  Set the organisation goals as a priority. Don’t wander off into your own
  silos, but achieve alignment of team members with committed partnerships.

  ### The Five Levels of Alignment


  > "The informal question ‘Do we all agree?’ is often used in meetings. Having
  no other option than to agree or disagree, many people nod and comply. The
  tragedy is that complying is often mistaken as alignment, until a breakdown
  occurs"- Fearless Leadership, page 235-236


  Malandro has developed a unique template to provide clarity around
  accountability for agreements.


  The template is referred to as The Five Levels of Alignment. Where are you?


  **Level 1:** Resigned; being actively disengaged and expecting nothing to
  change.  

  **Level 2:** Concerned; not aligned and concerned about some aspects such as a
  third party.  

  **Level 3:** Complying; a form of resignation but letting the group take
  accountability rather than taking responsibility for you own concerns.  

  **Level 4:** Intellectually Committed; supporting the decision but lacking
  full commitment for execution throughout initiation to full implementation and
  completion.  

  **Level 5:** Emotionally and Intellectually Committed; Alignment is both
  intellectual and emotional and both aspects must be addressed.


  To achieve alignment in an organisation, ask you group where they stand on the
  alignment scale and if they are feeling understood and listened to. Ask for
  communication around issues if they are not aligned, address behavioural blind
  spots such as the need to be right or remaining silent, check for automatic
  listening, and ask for support when they may not completely support the
  decision initially.


  By keeping conversations open and direct until all issues have been exposed,
  all parties will be heard and alignment will be easier. Practice this
  behaviour consistently and results will be achievable.

  ### Automatic listening


  > "Automatic listening is the process of unconsciously filtering and
  distorting information to support your views and beliefs."- Fearless
  Leadership, page 75


  To maintain 100%-zero accountability and avoid the behaviour of a need to be
  right we must check our assumptions when listening for information and remain
  open to new ideas and points of interest. Listen to others without defending,
  explaining or justifying. Automatic listening is a closed loop. Something
  happens and…


  1.  you have a reaction

  2.  you form a judgement

  3.  you make up a story

  4.  you search for evidence

  5.  you predict the future


  It is based on beliefs rather than intention. It is a very dangerous automatic
  behaviour and can have devastating results.


  When you are aware of this automatic rigid behaviour and how this affects
  others negatively you have the ability to make a breakthrough in leadership.


  It all begins with self-awareness. 100%-zero accountability means that you can
  bring understanding and compassion when others are stuck in your automatic
  thinking. Fearless leadership means letting go of the need to be right, expand
  your thinking and take decisive action to correct your behaviours and achieve
  better outcomes.


  Consider how you make judgements on people or groups. Ask yourself: “What
  evidence have I collected?” and “What stories have I told?” Check your ego and
  examine how your behaviour is counterproductive.
f_conclusion: >-
  Malandro’s _Fearless Leadership_ is a genuine leadership Bible. Her
  recommendations are difficult to implement and control because our default or
  automatic behaviours are natural stumbling blocks to fearless leadership, but
  the book provides many exercises to begin and I suggest all leaders should.

As aspiring leaders we must become aware of our internal strengths but also recognize our blind spots. Blind spots are hidden in people’s lives, we are completely unaware of this behaviour and its damaging effects on both ourselves and more importantly, to our coworkers and colleagues who are prudently aware of those things we can’t see ourselves. Dr. Loretta Milandro, author of _Fearless Leadership_, brilliantly describes ten blind spots within us all and provides insight into first recognizing this behaviour and then challenging ourselves to allow others to coach our behaviour around these blind spots.

Leaders become engrossed in navigating the success of their business and neglect and the most important aspects of running a successful business: its culture of communication and people. Blind spots are not flaws and are not deliberate, they are what Malandro refers to as “automatic behaviours”. Examples of these automatic behaviours are “the need to be right” and “have all the answers”, while concurrently ignoring the need to be more aligned to business success. Others develop a victim mentality while acquiring co-conspirators to encourage and enhance this limiting belief.

A fearless leader must be able to surround themselves with “Coaches” who will address their behaviour; they must not be offended but instead take the coaching on board and correct the behaviour. A fearless leader must also recognize blind spots, ask for completely honest feedback, accept responsibility for their actions and stop justifying their behaviour by defending their positive intentions. When challenged on weakness, a fearless leader must stop the behaviour, make corrections and acknowledge the behaviour.
