  ### Understanding and Uncovering Deep Bias, Not Fighting Each Other


  > "Recognizing sexism is harder than it once was. Like the micro-aggressions
  people of colour endure daily—racism masked as subtle dismissals—today’s
  sexism is insidious, causal, politically correct, even friendly. It is a kind
  of can’t-put-your-finger-on, not-particularly-overt, hard-to-quantify,
  harder-even-to-call-out behavior that maybe isn’t necessarily intentional, or
  conscious. Sometimes women exhibit it too. None of that makes it any less
  damaging."- Feminist Fight Club, page xxii


  I’m aware, as I’m sure Bennett is, that just using the words “feminism” and
  “patriarchy” feels aggressive to some people. I’m not one of those people. But
  the book lays out a straightforward answer to those sorts of objections. The
  tactics that Bennett provides for combating sexism in the world and workplace
  are all strategies creating a more egalitarian environment for everyone. The
  fight is against the construct and manifestation of patriarchy, not against
  individuals.


  We can all get better at navigating our workplaces, regardless of our gender
  expression, and understanding the biases we have (often unconsciously). The
  key is to recognize that becoming aware of our behavior, and correcting it
  when needed, is not a personal failing. Look around your workplace: are men in
  the C-Suite while women primarily run the administration? Do you hear
  water-cooler talk about your breastfeeding co-worker getting “special
  treatment”? Are all of your staff development events focused entirely on
  playing beer-pong or going to sporting events? Start to look for opportunities
  to change those behaviors. Sexism and bias in the workplace can be subtle and
  insidious. By simply becoming more aware of the way it can manifest in the
  workplace, you can start to contribute to a solution.

  ### Pay Me!


  > "There’s no easy way around it: negotiating sucks. It’s difficult,
  anxiety-inducing, awkward, risky—no matter your gender. Some people are good
  at it, a few may even enjoy it, but most people I know would rather do almost
  anything else (and in fact we often do avoid it, at great cost."- Feminist
  Fight Club, page 197


  The wage gap is one of the most frustrating elements of the modern workplace
  for me. Pair that with the “pink tax” (i.e. higher prices for personal care
  products, dry-cleaning, etc. that are specifically marketed to women), and the
  result is a systemic economic disadvantage for women. We often hear that women
  make approximately 78 cents on the dollar compared to men—a frustrating
  statistic on its own, and even more disheartening when you pay attention to
  the fact that women of colour typically make even less.


  The last time I was in a position to negotiate a pay increase, I felt so
  nervous and sick about it that I almost abandoned the task. I was also fairly
  certain that my (male) predecessor, who was let go for poor performance, had
  been making more money than me, despite my own glowing reviews. The modest
  increase wasn’t even close to what I’d been hoping for, but I was so nervous
  about the process that I enthusiastically accepted the low-ball increase and
  silently kicked myself later for being such a pushover.


  Bennett outlines a fantastic cheat sheet for negotiating a raise, complete
  with sample language to practice ahead of the meeting, follow-up steps, and
  countering objections. I wish I’d had this handy when I was negotiating. We
  all (yes men too) need to do our part to fight the wage gap. Whether that
  means trying to negotiate a raise, disclosing your salary to team members or
  others in your field, or recommending outstanding members of your team for a
  promotion, Bennett makes it clear that there is at least one actionable step
  you can take today.

  ### Beware the Manterrupter


  > "We speak up in a meeting, only to hear a man’s voice boom over ours. We
  chime in with an idea, perhaps a tad too uncertainly—and a dude interjects
  with authority. We may have the ideas, but he has the vocal cords—causing us
  to clam up, lose our confidence, or cede credit for our work."- Feminist Fight
  Club, page 7


  The book lists many examples of workplace sexism, and provides solutions, or
  “fight moves” to help overcome them. Watch out for the Bropropriator, the
  Mansplainer, and the Womenemy. Perhaps the most easily recognizable is the
  “Manterrupter”: a person who frequently speaks over others in meetings.
  Bennett uses the example of Kanye West grabbing the microphone from Taylor
  Swift at the 2008 VMAs, so that he could launch into a monologue about
  himself, despite the fact that _she_ was the award winner. Classic
  manterruption.


  Bennett gives four tactics to fight against this behavior in the workplace:


  *   **Verbal chicken: stay strong and keep talking**. Throw in some side-eye,
  and make it clear that you’re not finished. Don’t back down.

  *   **Womanterruption**: Speak up when you see this happening to your
  colleagues. “Wait, can you let her finish?”

  *   **Lean In (Literally)**: Use body language to assert yourself.

  *   **Kanye-Free Zone**: Are you running the meeting? Make it a policy that
  interruptions will not be tolerated.


  Being interrupted constantly is a demoralizing experience, and I love the
  simplicity of these four tactics for minimizing interruptions in the
  workplace, which can easily be applied in your next meeting.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Feminist Fight Club_ is funny, charming, sometimes infuriating, and always
  entertaining. What I love about Bennett’s approach is that the book is packed
  with actionable steps to combat sexism and bias in the workplace. For anyone
  who has felt the discomfort of working in an environment that felt even
  vaguely sexist (which is, unfortunately, almost all the women I know), this
  book will arm you with strategies to recognize, call out, and begin to change
  sexist behavior. These tactics also extend to other biased behavior—implicit
  racism, ageism, ableism, or subtle discrimination that may be playing out in
  the workplace. Regardless of your position, a more inclusive working
  environment creates better opportunities for everyone.

  “And yet each of us, in every field, in every role, was stumbling into gender
  land mines at seemingly every turn—and often ones we didn’t even know existed.
  It was like trying to dodge the stench that lurks on a New York City street on
  a hot summer night: there you were, minding your own business, and BAM.”

I first heard about _Feminist Fight Club_ on one of my favorite podcasts: [_Call Your Girlfriend_](http://www.callyourgirlfriend.com/). Hosts Ann Friedman and Aminatou Sow were interviewing the author, Jessica Bennett, and talking about their tactics for dealing with sexism in the workplace. The conversation was candid, funny, and exhausting (seriously, every woman I know has some anecdotal evidence of sexism in the workplace, and that just makes me _tired_), and I knew I wanted to pick up a copy.

The book is a charming, sometimes hilarious, sometimes dead-serious blend of memoir and self-help. Bennett’s stories about herself and the women she champions are personal and filled with great advice. The book includes illustrations, factoids, quotes, and yes, even cursing (which was no issue for me; after 10 years in the—sometimes sexist—service industry, there’s a special place in my heart for people who curse when warranted). Bennett arms the reader with fight moves that can be used against workplace sexism, to create a more inclusive workplace for everyone.
