  ### The Conversation Is The Relationship


  > "Never mistake talking for conversation."- Fierce Conversations, page 228


  Every time you have a conversation with your employees, your partner, a friend
  or your child, the words you exchange define your relationship with them. The
  words you say, the ones you withhold; the thoughts, tone and feelings you
  convey are all elements that define your relationship with the other person.
  Too often, we hold back, or worse, allow ourselves to be distracted rather
  than giving the other person the respect of our complete presence. We need to
  remember that **our conversations _are_ our relationships**, and **we need to
  work hard to bring the fullness of ourselves to every conversation we have.**


  How can you begin to change the quality of your conversations with the people
  who matter in your life?

  ### Combine Honesty With Compassion


  > "Take responsibility for your emotional wake."- Fierce Conversations, page
  187


  When you show up and get real in your conversations, you have to be ready to
  manage the emotions that can be generated as a result. **Digging deeper and
  being honest does not give you the right to simply unload blunt statements on
  the other person and end it there** – you must slow down and think about the
  effect the conversation is having on them. Take time to complete the
  conversation.


  Scott reminds us that each perspective needs to be honoured, and everyone
  shares in creating the full picture of reality in any given situation. She
  coaches us to use silence, noting “the more emotionally loaded the subject,
  the more silence is required.” Silence allows us to regroup, and create space
  for additional comments. Wait and see what else emerges.


  “Being real is not the risk. The real risk is that:  

  _I will be known.  

  I will be seen.  

  I will be changed._”

  ### Go Deep - Interrogate Reality


  > "Recognize that there is something within us that responds deeply to people
  who level with us, who do not pamper us or offer compromises but, instead,
  describe reality so simply and compellingly that the truth seems inevitable."-
  Fierce Conversations, page 19


  Scott tells us, “you get what you tolerate”, and she pushes us to pursue
  deeper conversations that draw out the core truths, and address the underlying
  issues. You may suspect that there are issues in your team or organization,
  but if you only skim the surface and fail to deal with the deeper realities,
  you will never address the problem. She asks, “What are you pretending not to
  know?”


  Scott provides a model called “Mineral Rights” (think “mining for gold”) plus
  lists of probing questions for engaging in effective one-on-one meetings with
  your team. Ask them to bring their most important issues to your meetings, and
  guide the conversations with your questions, not by telling them what to do.
  Try saying “What topic are you hoping I won’t bring up today?” or “If nothing
  changes, what is likely to happen?” and see what conversations unfold.


  As real conversations begin, real emotions may emerge, and you need to be
  ready.
f_conclusion: >-
  All of this talk about getting real or managing emotions may feel overwhelming
  to some, and unnecessary to others, but at the very least, I encourage you to
  think about any issues in your life you may be avoiding. What truths are
  keeping you from building meaningful connections in your life? **What is
  holding you back in your conversations or keeping you from getting real with
  those who matter to you most?**

> "When you think of a fierce conversation, think passion, integrity, authenticity, collaboration. Think cultural transformation. Think of leadership." _\- Fierce Conversations, preface_

I read a lot for work, and rarely have I been as completely consumed with the contents of a book, or seen the potential to use the lessons from it, as I have with this book. Susan Scott’s _Fierce Conversations_ is **an incredible tool for anyone looking to improve the depth and effectiveness of their conversations**, whether at work or at home. This book is **essential for leaders, coaches, and anyone who has relationships they feel could improve.**

Scott’s book provides a system for moving beyond the superficial level of interactions we often allow ourselves to have, and pursue deeper and richer connections as a result.

All of this talk about getting real or managing emotions may feel overwhelming to some, and unnecessary to others, but at the very least, I encourage you to think about any issues in your life you may be avoiding. What truths are keeping you from building meaningful connections in your life? **What is holding you back in your conversations or keeping you from getting real with those who matter to you most?**

“…so often people forget that one of the fiercest conversations any of us can have is to tell someone how important he or she is in our lives, how much we love and value that person.”

Think about your own life, the conversations you have every day, and the relationships you cherish. **Are you showing up fully in your life every day?** Where do you need to get fierce?
