  ### Keywords


  > "Having a systematic understanding of your keywords is arguably the most
  important step in successful SEO."- Fifty SEO Ideas, Chapter 1


  There are several ideas/chapters on building and using keywords, so I am going
  to incorporate three of them here. Keywords are the way in which Google knows
  what your website is about so it can display it when specific words are typed
  into the search field. Keywords drive Google and SEO, but as McDonald says,
  most organizations lack a structured list of their own keywords. I know the
  ones for my website are outdated.


  **Step One: Keyword Discovery**


  1\. Brainstorm your keywords. What words best describe your company?


  2\. Use free keyword tools to build a large list of keywords for your site.
  Google has a good one, search “Google Keyword Tool”. You can also use the
  Google Suggest option, by typing in a phrase into Google and see what
  suggestions come up.


  3\. Build a structured keyword worksheet.


  4\. Measure your success in Google Analytics. This will give you detailed
  insights into your website. Sign up for a free account.


  **Step Two: Title Tags**


  The title tags are the phrases that are seen at the top of the browser, the
  headline on a Google search, and helps Google understand what the page is
  about.


  1\. After you have prioritized your keywords in terms of importance, put your
  most important keywords in your title tags on your home page.


  2\. On all of your other pages, make sure the title tag contains the target
  keywords.


  3\. Make sure that the title tags are accurate and unique.


  4\. Title tags should be less than 69 characters.


  **Step Three: Meta Description**


  Think of meta description tags as your suggestion to Google for how to
  describe the pages on your website. They are different from title tags in that
  they are larger and explain in more detail what the page is about. Think of
  title tags as short phrases, meta descriptions as sentences. When you do a
  Google search, the title tags are the link, and the meta description is the
  description of the page under the link. Follow the same steps for designing
  meta descriptions as you would for title tags, but keep in mind that meta
  descriptions are longer (155 characters).


  If you aren’t tech savvy or don’t make changes to your site, your web person
  can make the changes for you once you provide them the keywords, title tags,
  and meta descriptions.

  ### Speed Check


  > "One of the metrics that Google pays more and more attention to is your web
  site response speed."- Fifty SEO Ideas, Chapter 44


  After I read about response speed, I felt embarrassed that I never realized
  this before. It makes so much sense to me now that this should be a factor,
  but I have never checked the speed of any of my websites, ever. I’ve had
  probably a dozen different websites over the past ten years. How embarrassing
  is that? (Blushing.) When I think about it, I have zero patience for
  slow-loading sites. My attention span is limited at the best of times, but
  online it’s even shorter. Especially on my phone. McDonald helps us solve this
  problem.


  To Do:


  1\. Go to one of the free speed tools
  ([here](http://developers.google.com/pagespeed),
  [here](http://tools.pingdom.com) or
  [here](http://google.com/webmasters/tools)).


  2\. Measure your website speed. If it is slower than 20% of other sites, you
  should be concerned.


  3\. Have your web developer fix your site with the solutions that the sites
  provide. Note that the solutions are technical – I don’t understand what they
  mean, so unless you are a guru yourself, call your web developer.


  I played around with all three of the sites above. Google gave me a
  not-so-good report, the Pingdom was a bit better. All of them listed the
  challenges on my site. Excuse me for a moment while I call my web guy…


  Once thing I stumbled upon that I found REALLY useful was Pingdom’s free
  service that tests your site every minute to ensure that it’s up and running.
  Did I mention it’s free? Did I mention it tests every minute? Consider me
  signed up! They also have other paid services that are more in-depth.

  ### Press Releases


  > "News is one of the most powerful techniques that you can use for Search
  Engine Optimization."- Fifty SEO Ideas, Chapter 8


  Google _loves_ new content. Posting new content is what lets Google know that
  your website is living and not stale, old, and irrelevant. Press releases (PR)
  are a great way to add content to your site. McDonald suggests doing this
  monthly and says that it should only take a few hours or less.


  To Do:


  1.  Identify timely, SEO friendly news topics. Admittedly, this is an area
  that I have been terrible at. My goal, starting next month, is to do a monthly
  press release. I think that I sometimes fall into the trap where I think our
  news isn’t very interesting, but in reality, it may make for an interesting
  read by others.

  2.  Make sure that your keywords are in the PR, but don’t “keyword-stuff”.
  Google frowns upon that.

  3.  Post the PR on your website.

  4.  Syndicate your PR through free or paid news services.
  [PRLog](http://www.prlog.com) is one of the best he says.
  [PRWeb](http://www.prweb.com) is a paid service that starts at $99 per
  release.[  
      ](http://www.prweb.com)
  5.  McDonald has some [videos](http://www.bit.ly/Pd8xZ8) that show you how to
  syndicate a PR. If you are doing any press releases, this is a must watch.

  6.  Identify bloggers who may be interested in your PR. Post links to it on
  all of your social media outlets.
f_conclusion: >-
  McDonald has some great ideas in his book. I’m not going to use all of them,
  but I did pick several to execute in the next couple of months. Writing a book
  on a technology like Google is challenging I would imagine. The technology
  changes daily, if not hourly. I did find a link that was listed in his book
  that didn’t work, but McDonald’s own website site is packed with free
  information. I think you know how to find his site.

> "Just Google 'Jason McDonald' to find his site or send him a message – he’s number one on Google!" _\- Fifty SEO Ideas, Introduction_

You’d think that a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Guru should be number one on Google when you search his name, right? Well, Jason McDonald is!

I don’t think I am alone in wanting my website to be at the top (or at least on the first page) of Google’s results, so I picked up McDonald’s book, _Fifty SEO Ideas: Free Tips, Secrets and Ideas for Search Engine Optimization_, looking for some quick, easy to implement techniques to help me do so. I wasn’t disappointed.

McDonald tells the reader right out of the gate that not all of the 50 ideas in his book will be relevant. You can pick and choose “like a recipe in a cookbook” which techniques you want to use; you don’t have to do them in order either. Each technique is laid out on two pages with a bulleted summary, a description, a “Best For”, timeline, importance, To-Do list, and resource links. It’s an easy read.

Is your website listed at the top of Google? Have you ever been frustrated by a slow-loading site?
