  ### Learn the Art of Finance


  > "The art of accounting and finance is the art of using limited data to come
  as close as possible to an accurate description of how well a company is
  performing."- Financial Intelligence for Entrepreneurs, page 6


  I think we can all agree that 2 + 2 = 4.  

  But when it comes to the world of business finance, it’s not that clear cut.


  “\[bookkeepers and accountants\] can’t know exactly what everyone in the
  company does every day, so they don’t know exactly how to allocate costs. They
  can’t know exactly how long a piece of equipment will last, so they don’t know
  how much of its original cost to record in any given year… Accounting and
  finance are not reality, they are a reflection of reality, and the accuracy of
  that reflection depends on the ability of bookkeepers, accountants, and
  finance professionals to make reasonable assumptions and to calculate
  reasonable estimates.”

  ### Follow the Open Book Management (OBM) Philosophy


  > "As everyone learns the numbers, people begin to take responsibility for
  making the numbers move in the right direction, in accordance with monthly or
  quarterly goals that they help set."- Financial Intelligence for
  Entrepreneurs, page 218


  Once you understand the assumptions and estimates being made, you’ll get a
  better feel for the numbers and be able to make more informed decisions for
  your business.


  But don’t stop there. Karen and Joe recommend that you not only share the
  financial information with your employees, but you also help them learn what
  the numbers really mean and how it affects their roles.  

  In fact, they recommend developing a strategy for developing a financially
  intelligent company from top to bottom. This strategy might include:


  *   Delivering three short training sessions (30 to 60 minutes long), where
  each session focuses on a single financial concept (i.e. one on income
  statement, one on cash flow and one on the balance sheet).These courses can be
  offered on a monthly basis and can be taught by you first.

  *   Have weekly numbers meetings where you share your organization’s key
  numbers with your employees.

  *   Use visual aids like scorecards and/or [money
  maps](http://www.business-literacy.com/bli-products-services/money-maps/) to
  reinforce the key numbers to be aware of.


  Now, I understand that there are different rules governing what financial
  information can be shared if you’re a public or private company, so keep those
  rules in mind.


  The underlying philosophy here is that by being as transparent as possible
  with your numbers, your employees are not only more knowledgeable about the
  direction of the business, but they’re also able to make better and more
  effective decisions in their daily duties as a result (which is why you’ve
  hired them in the first place).


  In fact, Joe followed this exact principle in his company Setpoint, and it
  helped him get through times of difficulty and crisis when his accountant
  thought they wouldn’t survive.


  _“You know, I think the reason why you get through these difficult times is
  because you train your employees and share the finances with them. When times
  are tough, the company rallies together and finds a way to fight through it.”_

  ### Understand the Assumptions & Estimates


  > "If you aren’t aware of the assumptions and estimates that underline the
  numbers and how those assumptions and estimates affect the numbers in one
  direction or another, your decisions may be faulty."- Financial Intelligence
  for Entrepreneurs, page 13


  Bookkeepers, accountants and other financial professionals in your
  organization make various assumptions and estimates when they prepare
  financial statements such as the Income Statement.


  And it’s crucial to the success of your business that you understand what
  these assumptions and estimates are because these are the numbers you use to
  make daily decisions on the direction of your business.


  Let’s look at an example that Karen and Joe share in the book:


  “Imagine, for instance, that you run a business that resells specialized
  telephone equipment to local customers. Most of your customers buy the
  equipment with a maintenance contract, and the whole thing is wrapped up in
  one financial package. Now, suppose you deliver the equipment in October, but
  the maintenance contract is good for the following twelve months. How much of
  the initial purchase price should be recorded on the books for October? After
  all, you haven’t yet delivered all the services that you are responsible for
  during the year. Your accountant can estimate the value of those services, of
  course, and adjust revenue for October accordingly. But this requires a big
  judgment call.”


  As you can see, even seemingly simple questions like “When is a sale a sale?”
  require some assumptions to be made. And if you take the example above one
  step further and realize that you most likely pay out sales commissions and
  bonuses according to how and when revenue is recognized, you begin to see that
  these assumptions have a significant impact on how you run your business.


  So make sure you speak to your bookkeepers, accountants and other finance
  professionals to understand what the numbers in your financial statements
  _really mean_. Your business depends on it.

  Understanding the numbers is critical to the success of any organization. Of
  course, with the limited time you already have as a busy entrepreneur, you may
  not have the time to get your MBA in Finance. Thankfully, _Financial
  Intelligence for Entrepreneurs_ is there as your guide to the hidden language
  of Finance.

  with customers and employees. Your concept for a company is probably
  fantastic. But if you don’t know finance, you’re operating at a disadvantage
  in the world of business."

Do you know what your burn rate is?  
What about your cash conversion cycle?  
Are you surprised that your company is running out of cash even though it’s profitable?

These questions, and more, are answered in _Financial Intelligence for Entrepreneurs_ as Karen Berman and Joe Knight, founders of the Business Literacy Institute, break down what the numbers in your business _really_ mean.

They walk through, step-by-step, how you can analyze your company’s Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement to _really_ understand how your business is performing and how you can make more informed, and better, business decisions.

And no, you don’t need an MBA in Finance to understand all of it either.

But before you get caught up in calculating profit margins, return on assets, days sales outstanding and other critical ratios, it’s important to understand one fundamental principle: “finance is as much an art as it is a science.”
