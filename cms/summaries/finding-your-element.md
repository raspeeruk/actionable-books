  ### Three Elemental Principals


  > "Being in your Element is where your natural aptitudes meet your passions."-
  Finding Your Element, page 33


  The process of discovering one’s Element is more like a quest than a 10-step
  program – highly individualized, introspective, and challenging. Robinson
  reminds us of the unifying factor for this journey: the simple miracle of our
  existence. And his three principles set the stage for our quest.


  **Principal #1:** Your life is unique. “There’s no one in the world precisely
  like you, nor is there anyone else living your life.”


  **Principal #2:** You create your own life. “What sets human beings apart from
  the rest of nature…is that human beings have immense natural powers of
  imagination and creativity.”


  **Principal #3:** Life is organic. “\[L\]ife is a constant process of
  improvisation between interests and personality on the one hand and
  circumstances and opportunities on the other.”

  ### What's Your Attitude


  > "Whether you see the cup half empty or half full is often a matter of choice
  and experience."- Finding Your Element, page 148


  Citing Carol Dweck’s research, Robinson reminds us that our mindset,
  dispositions, and attitudes have a significant effect on what we achieve in
  life. In fact, individuals with a growth mindset (versus a fixed mindset)
  believe that they can change and grow. “The passion for stretching yourself
  and sticking to it even, or especially, when it’s not going well is the
  hallmark of the growth mindset.” So too, finding your Element is frequently
  the result of your attitude and persistence.

  ### Where's Your Tribe


  > "Connecting with people who share your Element can have tremendous benefits
  for you and for them…affirmation, guidance, collaboration and inspiration."-
  Finding Your Element, page 188


  The value of finding your tribe(s) cannot be understated. The members of your
  tribe offer validation and encouragement, but finding yourself in the wrong
  tribe sucks the life out of you. Robinson encourages us to “try a tribe on for
  size.” Spend time with other people with differing interests, seek
  opportunities you may never have considered, and look for others who are doing
  what you think might be your passion. Getting to know the culture of a tribe
  can help you determine your Element, as well as the ways in which you prefer
  to engage your Element.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s important to remember that identifying your Element is an extremely
  personalized process. Finding your tribe and having a positive mindset are
  only a couple of the strategies outlined in Finding Your Element, but they
  resonated with me as key to determining if your current state (in work and
  life) is fulfilling or draining. If you’d like to delve deeper, pick up a copy
  of Finding Your Element and work through the exercises outlined in its pages.
  You’ll be glad you did.

  inward journey to explore what lies within you and an outward journey to
  explore opportunities in the world around you."

_Finding Your Element_ is a deeply introspective guide to your talents, passions, preferences and goals. Based upon his bestselling book, [_The Element_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-element/), Ken Robinson outlines an intensive journey that will help each of us discover our own Element.

Robinson provides a series of guided exercises to evaluate your current life, review what activities and ideas give you energy, and ultimately to identify your unique contribution to the world. While the bulk of this work is personal and intimate, the author outlines key behaviors that will help anyone dig deeper into their inner workings to identify and harness their Element.
