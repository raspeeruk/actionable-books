  ### Not an event, after all


  > "…there are four stages in the exit process, and doing the deal comes not
  first or second, but third. It’s preceded by the strategic phase, when you
  build into the company the qualities and characteristics that will allow you
  to have the kind of exit you want."- Finish Big, page 93


  What little we do hear about entrepreneurs exiting (selling) their businesses
  is often hype and spectacle; tech startups that sell for a billion dollars, 18
  months after incorporating. It’s almost always about the deal. The numbers.
  How much someone “cashed in” for. We are rarely exposed to the details of a
  “normal” private company sale, and we don’t hear about what comes before the
  sale… or after it.


  Bo spent five years researching real life stories for _Finish Big_ (many of
  which are in the book, and make for some truly engrossing tales) and
  determined that there are four distinct phases to a successful exit.


  *   **Stage one is exploratory.** Learning what options exist, and deciding
  what you do and don’t care about in an exit. It may also include coming up
  with a number—that is, the amount of money you’d be happy to walk away with
  when the time comes—and a time frame.

  *   **Stage two is strategic.** It requires learning to view your company as a
  product itself, not just as a deliverer of products or services, and then
  building into it the qualities and characteristics that will maximize its
  value and allow you to have the kind of exit you want (and to whom).

  *   **Stage three is about execution.** This is the deal stage, whatever type
  of exit you may be looking for. It could be a sale to a third party, but there
  are lots of other options that make more sense – a management buyout, a gift
  to your children, a liquidation of assets, or any number of other possible
  outcomes.

  *   **Stage four is the transition.** It begins with the completion of the
  deal and ends when you’re fully engaged in whatever comes next. Until you’ve
  moved on—not just physically but psychologically—to a new venture, a new
  career, a redefined role, or even retirement, your exit isn’t complete.


  As Bo goes on to explain in the book, how each stage unfolds is unique to each
  entrepreneurs’ situation, but the important part is to appreciate that all
  four stages exist and you **will** go through them, whether it’s on your terms
  or through the lens of regret as you analyze stage 1 or 2 after the deal is
  done. So why wait?

  ### Strange Bedfellows


  > "'Everybody else spent the time talking about terms and fee structures and
  trying to impress us,' he said. 'These guys spent the time asking us questions
  and trying to understand our needs.'"- Ed Zimmer, as quoted in Finish Big,
  page 186


  One of the big eye openers for me in reading _Finish Big_ was the distinct
  difference in mentality between what Bo labels as **Financial Buyers** vs
  **Strategic Buyers**.


  Financial buyers are those who want to flip your company, basically. They’re
  in it for the short-term cash, and they’ll maximize short term revenue and
  drive up the company’s annual earnings, often at “whatever the cost”
  (typically culture).


  Strategic buyers are interested in leveraging what you’ve built. They might be
  a competitor, a complementary business looking to expand, or have some other
  business reason for wanting to acquire you. But, by and large, they want to
  see your business continue to succeed.


  In other words, not all money is created equal. If you care what the business
  will look like after you’re gone, you’ll want to know what type of buyer will
  help take it there, and what their motivations might be for buying you at all.
  You’ll want to build the business around those motivations.

  ### Why?


  > "When you think about it, service is a factor—perhaps the primary factor—in
  creating the sense of purpose that successful entrepreneurs derive from their
  businesses."- Finish Big, page 261


  A good portion of the book is dedicated to stage four of the process: the
  stage of transition into the next phase of life for an entrepreneur who has
  cut ties with her business. But interestingly, by focusing on the first two
  stages early on we can dramatically improve stage 4. Here’s what I mean:


  As Bo discovered through his research, entrepreneurs seemed to fall cleanly
  into one of two camps, post sale; those who were exhilarated and proud of the
  exit, and those who were left feeling lost, confused and bitter. A big part of
  this came down to how much the latter group was gaining from their business
  beyond the financial compensation.


  As illustrated in the quote above, **Purpose** is a massive part of what an
  entrepreneur derives from their business. Additionally, they usually find
  their **Tribe** (the people they interact with every day), **Structure**, as
  created by the demands of the work, and **a sense of achievement**, all of
  which can be difficult to immediately recreate post sale.


  For me (many years from a sale, myself) reading that list was a good reminder
  of why I’m in business in the first place. There’s an altruistic desire to
  create positive change in the world through the work we do, and I’m proud of
  that. But it was also a great reminder of how much I gain personally from the
  structure, the daily wins, and the incredible tribe I get to be a part of.


  Whether we’re entrepreneurs or not (and if you’re not, thanks for reading this
  far!), I think there’s tremendous value in taking stock of what we’re gaining
  from our work. Most of us need a paycheque to keep the lights on, of course,
  but hopefully there’s a lot more there for you than simply the money.
f_conclusion: >-
  Like building a product in a vacuum, then launching it with the hope that
  someone will buy it, building your business without any thought to the exit is
  a risky way to go. _Finish Big_ has reminded me that regardless of when you
  plan to exit your business, the time to start thinking about it and planning
  for it is now. After all, if you’re going to spend years of your life
  dedicated to getting the business off the ground in the first place, don’t you
  want to know that will count for something in the end?

> "I have some advice for anyone who owns a business or is planning to launch one: If you haven’t already begun thinking about your eventual exit, now is the time to start." _\- Finish Big, page 25_

When I first launched Actionable Books (then _Goose Educational Media_), I had no intention of “exiting” my business. Exiting seemed like selling out back then and, frankly, kind of a dirty word. John Warrillow adjusted my thinking a fair ways through the pages of _Built to Sell_.

In his book _Think Big_ (due for release Nov 29, 2014), Bo Burlingham brings the point home with the line “_Of course, someday you will have to leave, and either the ownership will change hands or the business will be liquidated. You may leave feet first, but leave you will, one way or the other_.” That put the final nail in the coffin (so to speak).

Even if you’re not familiar with Bo by name, you’re likely familiar with his work. As the Executive Editor of _Inc._ magazine from 1983–1990 (and _Editor-at-large_ ever since) Bo was instrumental in growing the publication into the giant it is today. He’s penned one of my personal favorites, [_Small Giants_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/small-giants/)_,_ and co-authored 3 other books including [_The Knack_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-knack/), (later renamed _Street Smarts_). So I was delighted when I learned that he had another book on the way, and managed to finagle an advance copy.

_Finish Big_ doesn’t disappoint. It also reads like a natural follow up to _Small Giants_, tackling yet another important-but-rarely-discussed-topic ~ the process of exiting your business as an entrepreneur. And yes, “process” is an apt description and one that we should start now, before it’s too late.
