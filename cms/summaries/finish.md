  ### “Finished” is Always Better Than “Perfect”


  > "Some readers … think the opposite of perfectionism is failure. It’s not.
  The opposite is finished."- Finish, page 13


  When we set a goal, we’re aiming for a better something. But “better” quickly
  morphs into “best,” and this is how we set ourselves up to fail before we even
  begin working on our goal. If we miss a day in our new diet, we get derailed
  and have a hard time continuing the diet the next day. If we’re working on
  creating a new habit, we’re more likely to lose steam—or totally quit our
  habit building—if we miss a day.


  Acuff noticed that participation started to drop off in just the second day of
  the 30 Days of Hustle challenge. People with good intentions started to drop
  out when they missed a day, and no longer had a perfect “score” in the pursuit
  of their goal.


  When we stop trying to be perfect, or perform perfectly, we eliminate a huge
  stumbling block in our attempts to reach our goals. By accepting our own
  imperfections and being comfortable with our own imperfect steps, we are much
  more likely to cross our goal finish line.

  ### Decide Which Things You’ll “Bomb”


  > "The only way to accomplish a new goal is to feed it your most valuable
  resource: time. And what we never like to admit is that you don’t just give
  time to something, you take it from something else. To be good at one thing
  you have to be bad at something else."- Finish, page 33


  Most of us keep thinking we can do it all. We continually add to our already
  full plates and find it difficult to acknowledge we can’t get it all done. Our
  search for the best to-do app, project management software, time management
  book, or productivity class never ends. Acuff says we can either keep trying
  to do it all, or choose what we’ll not do at all (or do very imperfectly) and
  be successful pursuing a goal that really matters to us. Learning to let go of
  tasks that don’t serve us in pursuit of our goals can free up valuable time
  and energy that we can direct toward progress.


  Acuff chose four things “to bomb”:


  1.  Keeping up with TV conversations

  2.  Snapchat

  3.  E-mail

  4.  The satisfaction of cutting his own lawn


  In choosing your own things “to bomb,” you can use the author’s “traffic
  light” method. Some of your activities are like green lights because they’ll
  help you reach your goal. Other activities impede your progress. These are red
  lights. Start looking at your own daily activities to see which items are
  green lights or red lights.

  ### Reduce Your Goal by Half


  > "If I can get you to do a little one month and win, you’re more likely to do
  a little more the next month and win even more. In the course of a year or
  maybe even a lifetime that approach will always beat the
  kill-yourself-for-a-month approach."- Finish, page 25


  When we set a goal, we go for the stars. It’s much more exciting and
  motivating to have a BIG (and “perfect”) goal. We’re not happy setting small
  goals. In our planning, we’re almost always overly optimistic about what we
  can do and how much time it will take us to accomplish it all. This,
  inevitably, sets us up for failure because it’s next to impossible to set a
  big goal and execute perfectly day after day.


  In the 30 Days of Hustle challenge, Acuff asked participants to cut their goal
  in half—this simple act of reducing the goal helped the people stay motivated
  and it encouraged them to stay the course and continue the pursuit of their
  goal.
f_conclusion: >-
  If you’re looking for a book on goal achievement, look no further! Do you have
  a new goal you’d like to work on but you’re hesitating because you haven’t
  been too good at finishing previous goals you’ve set? This is a book that will
  help you feel normal about all of those goals and projects you’ve started in
  the past and never completed. But, more importantly, it will help you realize
  just how powerful an enemy perfectionism is to achieving your goals. And how
  easily you can eliminate it and start setting goals you can definitely
  achieve.

> “The harder you try to be perfect, the less likely you’ll accomplish your goals.” _\- Finish, page 16_

Throughout this entertaining book on goal achievement by Jon Acuff, perfectionism is the enemy, with a capital “E”. In one hilarious story after another, the author talks about the multiple ways perfectionism schemes to sabotage us when we set and pursue new goals.

Acuff created an online course called the “30 Days of Hustle” (no longer available) which had been taken by thousands of people. Researcher Mike Peasley from the University of Memphis studied and reported on the results of challenge participants. That information is the basis of this book. There were definite patterns in what helped the challenge participants achieve their goals and what helped ensure they wouldn’t be successful.

When we set a goal, we’re aiming for a better something. But “better” quickly morphs into “best,” and this is how we set ourselves up to fail before we even begin working on our goal. If we miss a day in our new diet, we get derailed and have a hard time continuing the diet the next day. If we’re working on creating a new habit, we’re more likely to lose steam—or totally quit our habit building—if we miss a day.

Acuff noticed that participation started to drop off in just the second day of the 30 Days of Hustle challenge. People with good intentions started to drop out when they missed a day, and no longer had a perfect “score” in the pursuit of their goal.

When we stop trying to be perfect, or perform perfectly, we eliminate a huge stumbling block in our attempts to reach our goals. By accepting our own imperfections and being comfortable with our own imperfect steps, we are much more likely to cross our goal finish line.

_Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done_ isn’t your usual dry tome on goals and productivity. It’s a fun and easy read, full of laugh-out-loud stories that the author uses to illustrate the various ideas he presents.

If your next goal doesn’t have to be perfect, what goal will you set?
