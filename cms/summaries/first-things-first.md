  ### Fourth Generation Time Management


  > "More than an evolution, we need a revolution. We need to move beyond time
  management to life leadership—to a fourth generation based on paradigms that
  will create quality-of-life results"- First Things First, page 31


  We are constantly bombarded by ugent choices in the modern, fast-paced
  landscape. Sometimes we don’t like these choices and we begin to neglect what
  we feel is of paramount importance to our lives, creating guilt and
  frustration. The authors review time management literature around the concepts
  of the clock and the compass, in addition to the three generations of time
  management. The clock is our commitments, appointments, schedules, goals and
  activities. The compass is our vision, values, principles, mission, direction
  and what we feel is important to our lives. The struggles begin when there are
  misalignments between our clocks and compasses. The three generations of time
  management are:


  *   First generation: Reminders and to-do lists. First things are what is in
  front of you and what you’re keeping track of.

  *   Second generation: Scheduling, calendars, appointments, planning and
  preparation for future events.

  *   Third generation: Value clarification, setting long term goals and
  prioritizing your activities daily.


  The authors suggest a fourth generation which includes the first three
  generations, but eliminates their weaknesses. These weaknesses include a
  reliance on urgency and a lack of understanding of the expectations around a
  good quality of life. This concept is not easy to grasp and means implementing
  a paradigm shift in thinking. This means moving from a position of responding
  to urgency, to concentrating on what is important. These are universal things
  like living a responsible life, loving fully, learning and leaving a legacy.
  Knowing what is important to you rather than being reactive around urgency is
  the key.


  The authors provide a time management matrix that is divided into four
  quadrants around importance and urgency. This gives the reader an easier means
  of grasping the concepts around urgency and importance.


  **Quadrant 1—Urgent and important:** Crisis (i.e. a medical emergency). It can
  be problematic if action is left in quadrant one too long.


  **Quadrant 2—Important, not urgent:** The quadrant of quality and personal
  leadership, long range planning, reading, empowering others and relationship
  development.


  **Quadrant 3—Urgent but not important:** Creates an illusion of being
  important, such as interruptions and phone calls.


  **Quadrant 4—Not urgent or important:** Trivia, social media, youtube videos
  about funny cats, etc.


  In order to move from urgency to importance (to quadrant 2) we must learn to
  identify our “first things” in life.

  ### Characteristics of Becoming Principle Centred

  ### To Live, To Love, To Learn, To Leave a Legacy


  > "What we are talking about are the true north realities upon which quality
  of life is based."- First things First, page 54


  In order to determine the first things the authors suggest three underlying
  principles:


  *   The fulfillment of four human needs: These needs are fundamental to human
  fulfillment and include Maslow’s hierarchy of live (physical), love (social),
  learn (mental) and legacy (meaning and purpose). If any of these needs are
  unmet, quality of life is greatly reduced, resulting in frustration and a
  constant sense of urgency. When all four needs are met there is fulfillment
  and joy, and we can address the things that are truly important.

  *   True north: This is a metaphor for the concept of lasting principles
  across time and civilizations that remain true to this day: including
  integrity, humility, courage, justice, service, and reciprocity.

  *   Unique human endowments: These include self awareness, conscience,
  independent will and creative imagination. These endowments allow us to decide
  between stimulus and response, a power to choose, respond and ultimately
  change if we want to.


  The authors suggest the following strategies to develop human endowments:


  *   Keep a personal journal, a high level quadrant 2 activity.

  *   Educate yourself by learning, listening and responding and reading.

  *   Make and keep promises to yourself and others

  *   Mediate and listen to your inner voice

  *   Develop creative imagination through visualisation.


  The bottom line is that the power to create a great quality life is not within
  any digital planner or technique, it is within us. It is the power of our
  inner compass that allows us to act with integrity and clarity when moments of
  choice occur.


  Implementation of shifting focus from urgency to importance involves six steps
  based on principles and endowments;


  *   Create an inner vision and mission statement based around what is
  important and empowering.

  *   Itemize your roles in life, i.e. father, employee, mentor, and identify
  where and how you can spend quality time in each role.

  *   Set weekly goals in each role to have the most positive impact.

  *   Schedule priorities for the week and wait for the right time.

  *   Preview the day based around the integrity of the moment, which means
  being able to adapt and change depending on circumstances.

  *   Evaluate, weekly cycle of checking successes and failures.
f_conclusion: >-
  _First Things First_ is a classic that still stands up well in the genre of
  management books. To get the most out of this book you have to become involved
  in a deep way and be willing to examine your life, your scripts, vision,
  missions, and motives: your “first things.” Exercises and charts throughout
  the book are useful tools to implement and understand concepts. It is a large
  book and can’t be digested in one sitting and perhaps is best read in parts.
  The concepts are profound and life changing. Any leader that wants to move
  from time management to personal management should read this book: it will
  give you the means of choosing the correct course to achieve a life of
  fulfillment.

> “Wheres there no gardener, there’s no garden” _\- First Things First, page 77_

_First Things First_ is a follow up to Stephen Covey’s best seller _The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_. In _First Things First_ the authors drill down into the concepts of personal time management—not around matters of urgency but around values and principles, i.e. “first things”. We have to cultivate and nurture all areas of our life over time. You don’t expect a bumper crop after neglect of a crop. By the same token, you can’t fix your relationships by not communicating with your partner, and you won’t become healthy by going to the gym for one week. We must move away from a reactive, quick fix culture and become conscious of our own destinies, by allowing our choices to be governed by principles and not short cuts; you must take care of the farm.
