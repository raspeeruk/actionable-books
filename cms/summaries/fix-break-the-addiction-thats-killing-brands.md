  ### Six elements of a cult brand


  > "Consumers are in the driver’s seat and no longer dependent upon ads to tell
  them what, or when, or from whom to buy."- Fix, page 138


  It’s not news that consumers no longer believe traditional advertising.
  However, for some reason the quote above really resonated with me. There was a
  time when advertisers “controlled” consumers. Now, consumers are in total
  control. They have more information and exposure than ever before. Marketing
  departments can certainly influence consumers but it’s no longer about
  “tricking” customers into buying. Consumers want to know who your brand really
  is at its core and believe in the brand, the product or service, and the
  people behind it. _Fix_ does a great job of telling us what consumers look for
  in order to latch onto a brand and become a cult follower. And let’s face it.
  We ALL want cult followers.


  _Fix_ identifies six key elements (plus some bonus items) that cult brands
  possess. Here’s a quick rundown. Brands should be **remarkable**; they should
  be so fantastic that they spark conversation. They should have **purpose**.
  Brands should stand for something. Brands should **inspire from the inside
  out** by empowering their employees as their biggest fans and followers. They
  should be **relatable**. Brands should be able to display human attributes and
  emotions so that they feel approachable. Brands should **involve** their fans.
  They should listen, celebrate their fans, and give their fans ownership of the
  brand. And brands should be **pervasive**. They should be everywhere consumers
  want them and do more than their competitors.

  ### Inspire from the inside out


  > "Cult followings don’t randomly materialize. No, companies aspiring to have
  an engaged fan base must first turn their attention inwards."- Fix, page 67


  One of the best ways to create a cult brand is to inspire your existing team
  to continue inspiring others on the team and outside the team. You have to
  multiply your following. Panera Bread has a strong culture of giving back to
  the communities where its stores are. They have created a culture of employees
  that go the extra mile. _Fix_ tells the story of a Panera employee that
  delivered soup that wasn’t on the menu to a terminally ill customer, simply
  because it was the right thing to do.


  I oversee our social media (among other things). Last week I had a manager
  reach out for help about creating a social media contest for a local
  conference using a hashtag. We offered suggestions and guidance for his
  contest and event, along with our reasoning to teach him how we think about
  social media strategy. We also offered him free product to give away in
  addition to the prize in his budget. I encouraged him to tell his peers that
  he got free product for helping to support the mission of our department and
  create positive stories for the overall brand. His team is creating positive
  (social) media and chatter about the company. PLUS, the manager will tell his
  peers that we rewarded him for the hashtag contest, which promotes working
  with our department and putting on similar contests locally in other parts of
  North America. He said I made his day by sending him the email about free
  product! I know that I can talk until I’m blue in the face about what managers
  can do to help us improve the online brand and positively impact recruiting.
  But if our managers are promoting it to each other, the culture grows
  exponentially faster.

  ### Be relatable


  > "At the end of the day, all business is personal (and can be very
  emotional)."- Fix, page 79


  I’ve read many books and articles that recommend that brands be more human so
  that consumers can feel a connection to the brand. In _Fix_ the concept
  finally really seemed to stick with me. The authors say that people look for
  brands that make it easy to interact with them, which helps to make them more
  human. We sometimes think of literally making the act of reaching out to us
  easier but _Fix_ offers a few more ideas. Think of ways that you can help
  customers or fans more comfortable reaching out to the people that represent
  the brand, like wearing name tags and answering the phone in an energetic and
  personable manner. These are easy fixes, but there are larger ideas in the
  book to consider as well.


  _Fix_ encourages brands to “show off their human side.” My company recruits
  tens of thousands of sales reps each year. The recruiting process can easily
  feel like our applicants are being herded through the early part of the
  process. One idea that I would love to implement is including in the interview
  confirmation email a headshot of the manager that our applicants will meet
  with for their interview. Our managers are very personable once we get
  applicants in front of them, but some applicants self-select out before they
  get a handshake and face-to-face human point of contact in the office. Maybe
  if they can “see” who they will be meeting with via email, the recruiting
  process becomes more human and more real much earlier in the process.


  Part of my daily routine is responding to comments and messages on Facebook.
  We want to be concise in the way that we answer questions. No one wants to
  read a really long monologue from the company. Nor do they want to read the
  language that the legal team approves. In my experience, legal speak lacks a
  human element. However, I have recently fallen into the habit of very concise
  but dry, generic responses. After reading this chapter, I’ve begun to inject a
  little more of my personal experience and personality into my responses. After
  all, I started in the sales rep position! I can speak first hand to answer
  many of their questions and I have no need for generic responses. I AM the
  human on the other end of the keyboard!
f_conclusion: >-
  As always, I can’t fit all my great “ah ha moments” into one summary. _Fix_ is
  a quick read and easy to navigate so it will be easy to go back to for
  inspiration. What thoughts will you use to “fix” or improve your brand? One?
  Some? All? Let me know in the comments below!

  their biggest professional desire isn’t to get people to buy, but to buy into

> "Cult brand leaders…refuse to settle for good enough and, more importantly, their biggest professional desire isn’t to get people to buy, but to buy into their cause." _\- Fix, page 127_

Do you ever feel like you keep reading the same old stuff about branding, the death of advertising, the new marketing, cult brands, and creating consumer loyalty? Fret not! _Fix: Break the Addiction that’s Killing Brands_ is not just another book about branding. Sure, the authors address those things but they do it in a fresh and concise manner. They cover a variety of ways that brands can create loyal followings. And they aren’t just preaching. They cite a variety of mini-case studies. Plus, they are living it through their company called Cult Collective, which is what they call a marketing engagement firm, rather than a traditional advertising firm. They want the reader to consider this book an intervention to “fix” your brand. So get to reading!
