  ### Who are you playing for?


  > "In short, a real-market orientation creates individual and societal good,
  while an expectations orientation creates a downward spiral that threatens
  both individual well-being and the health of our economy."- Fixing the Game,
  page 34


  A quick lesson to get you up to speed:


  Professional football exists in two worlds. First, you have the “on-field,” 60
  minute game. This is the “real world” game, one where two teams compete for a
  real victory. All round, the sport creates **real value**: fans are
  entertained enough to feel their money was well spent, players get paid,
  owners make money, and the organization thrives. We call this a positive-sum
  game – value is created. The other, darker world of professional football (and
  most sports for that matter) exists for the gamblers. The gambling world is a
  zero-sum game – one person wins when another person loses. Martin is quick to
  point out that this is not a book against the evils of gambling. It **is**,
  however, a book about the _nature_ of betting, the manipulations that attempt
  to “balance” the odds… and the devastating impact such a mentality can have
  when it bleeds over into the corporate world.


  In professional sports, balancing the odds through what’s known as a _point
  spread_ is an accepted part of the gambling game. In essence, a point spread
  means that if a game has a spread of 10.4 points, the favored team needs to
  win the game by at least 10.4 points for it to be considered a true win for
  the gamblers.


  Even if you’re not a football fan, you’ll likely recall the 2007 perfect
  season (16-0) for the New England Patriots, lead by MVP Quarterback, Tom
  Brady. What most of us aren’t aware of is that, as Brady continued to lead his
  team to victory after victory and speculators began to believe they’d never
  lose, the point spread that Brady had to beat grew to remarkable heights. So
  massive were the point spreads that the Pats only beat the odds 10 out of 16
  times that season. Speculation grew at such an exaggerated rate that, despite
  playing a perfect season, there was no way the Patriots could beat the
  expectations market forever.


  In the business world, we call this expectations market “The Stock Market”.
  And, as Martin brilliantly illustrates, the business world could do with some
  of the legislation that the professional football world has adopted.

  ### Who are you trying to impress?


  > "...everyone wants to be a part of a community, however unhealthy that
  community may be."- Fixing the Game, page 115


  Focusing on creating value is crucial but, as any high-schooler will tell you,
  so is fitting in. And, just as you would caution that high-schooler, it’s
  important that we know who it is we’re trying to fit in with. Are they a
  positive, or negative influence in our lives?


  Martin believes, as I do, that a fundamental part of what it is to be human is
  the desire to do good; to contribute to our societies and to be recognized for
  it. Working to impress the wrong group of people can fulfill the desire for
  acceptance in the short term, but can leave you feeling empty or lacking in
  the long run. Had Brady worked to the interests of the gamblers rather than
  the fans, he may have realized some short term financial success, and a sense
  of acceptance from that community, but in the long run would have likely been
  left feeling unfulfilled.


  We all want to be accepted. But are you seeking acceptance from a group that
  has your authentic, long term interests at heart?

  Imagine for a second that Tom Brady was betting on the games he was playing in
  (an act which is completely illegal, for the record). Looking at the
  impossible point spreads against him and his team, do you think he might have
  played differently? Do you think he might have taken a dive one game; bringing
  the point spread back down to a reasonable level for the next game? True Brady
  fans would argue that there’s no way their hero would even consider such
  tactics, but you’ve got to imagine the pressure that he would be under in such
  a situation. What if his financial contract was 10% of what it actually is,
  and the rest of his compensation was based on his ability to beat the points
  spread? You can imagine how quickly his focus would go from creating
  real-market value (winning football games) to expectations-market value
  (managing the point spread). This, sadly, is **exactly** the way the corporate
  compensation model works for executives of public companies. Their base salary
  is a small amount compared to the stock options they collect – stock options
  that only realize value if they manage stock analyst (Wall Street’s version of
  bookies) expectations. As a result, they face tremendous pressure to manage
  expectations rather than generate real value (read: win football games).


  The NFL commission cracks down on players betting on their own sport for one
  reason: **_the benefit of the fans_**… the NFL’s customers. The games are
  better when the players are playing to win, _legitimately_. Because he had
  nothing riding on the expectations-market, Brady’s motivation was to win the
  Superbowl for his team, his fans, **and** for himself.


  Where is your focus? On creating real value? Or is it on managing
  expectations? Many a salesperson’s compensation, for example, is based on
  “beating quota,” effectively overcoming the adjusted expectations of their
  manager. When you excel, your quota rises. When you excel again, your quota
  rises again. This cycle _can_ continue until the expectations become
  unreasonable. If you’re involved in a cycle like this, there’s a longer
  conversation that needs to take place. Hitting quota is **not** the same as
  delighting customers and maximizing positive company impact.


  Brady, for the record, signed a 4 year deal in 2010 for $78 million. Focusing
  on the customer can be profitable, too.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Fixing the Game_ is as brilliant as it is complex. Writing a two page article
  to cover the main points is no easy task, and I fear that I’ve done the book
  an injustice by attempting to do so. If you have any interest in the global
  stock market, the nature of corporate business practices (or football for that
  matter!) I would encourage you to pick up this book. Read it in long sittings,
  as the content is as dense as it is riveting. It’s truly been a long time
  since I’ve read something this mind expanding, and I look forward to seeing
  what Martin has up his sleeve in the future.

I like an easy read as much as the next guy, but every now and then I really enjoy reading something that challenges me; something I can sink my teeth into and expand my understanding of a new subject. Imagine my delight then, when I came across a book that taught me about the NFL Football world **and** Wall Street investing (two areas I know very little about… at least in any level of detail).

Roger Martin (author of [_The Opposable Mind_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-opposable-mind/) and [_The Design of Business_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-design-of-business/)_)_ has taken these two seemingly disparate institutions and woven a fantastic message about the importance of focusing on the tangible, real-world in front of us… and the danger of instead choosing to focus on the siren song of short term profitability.
