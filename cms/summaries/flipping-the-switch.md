  ### Ask the Question Behind the Question


  > "When we ask better questions, we get better answers. The QBQ guidelines
  show us how to build better questions and which questions to avoid. Also, it’s
  important to remember that these are questions we ask of ourselves, not of
  others. The QBQ is primarily a self-management tool, designed to help us
  reframe our own thinking."- Flipping the Switch, page 10


  Miller explains that the Question Behind the Question (QBQ) is a tool that
  helps us to take personal responsibility. QBQs begin with what or how, contain
  the word I, and are focused on action. However, Miller points out that **not
  all questions are created equal**. Incorrect Questions (IQ) ask why, when, or
  who. Asking why leads to complaining, when encourages procrastination, and who
  promotes blame. IQs also use they or them rather than I, which is a problem
  because we can only change ourselves, so asking what your spouse can do to
  stop being judgmental won’t work.


  Throughout the book Miller provides several IQ vs QBQ examples to help
  understand the difference. For example, instead of asking “who’s fault is it”
  when a mistake is made, ask “what can I do to help solve the problem?” Or
  rather than inquiring “why aren’t they more well behaved?” if your children
  are behaving unruly, ask “How can I become a better parent?” Miller emphasizes
  that **asking better questions leads us to better answers which in turn can
  influence our behavior.**

  ### Be honest and build trust


  > "Trust provides a wonderful advantage in our lives. It forms the foundation
  of strong relationships, which are critical to success both at work and at
  home. With Trust, we communicate more openly and effectively. We are more
  creative and collaborative. Our teams are stronger and more productive. Our
  families are happier. We find more satisfaction in everything we do."-
  Flipping the Switch, page 95


  We all know trust is important. No one is going to argue that point. **Why
  then do we micromanage, gossip about, or doubt those that we claim to trust?**
  By striving to be honest and ask QBQs we can work to build trust in our
  organizations and families. It will not be easy. If it were, there would be a
  lot less blaming. Was it really the weather’s fault that you couldn’t go
  running or did you just not want to go out in less than ideal conditions?
  Admittedly, there will be situations beyond your control but those will be the
  exceptions, the permitted kind, rather than the rule.


  Those you work with will put in more effort when they know you trust them and
  won’t seek to unload the blame at the first problem. Your children will be
  more likely to be honest and open with you if they know you will take the time
  to listen to them.


  “When we take responsibility for our own actions,” Miller writes, “when we
  practice being accountable, when we persistently invest the time in
  cultivating it–Trust will grow.”


  Miller stresses repeatedly throughout the book the importance of personally
  taking action with “how can I–how will I– apply these ideas at work and at
  home?” supplications throughout the book. I’ve found it is simultaneously
  empowering and debilitating to “flip the switch” of personal accountability in
  my life. It is empowering because I started to realize just how much I could
  influence my attitude and situation in many aspects of my life. It is
  debilitating because I started to realize how much I blamed others, how I fell
  short and used excuses. It is not the professor’s fault that I didn’t get
  anything out of class. Those realizations stung. But I am optimistic of the
  results and am confident they outweigh any blows to my pride.


  What can you do today to become more personally accountable and flip the
  switch?

  ### Don't believe you're the exception


  > "We tend to teach others what we need to hear ourselves... If we hear an
  idea and immediately think of other people who really need it, that's a good
  sign we may need the idea more than they do."- Flipping the Switch, page 20


  **Sometimes being the exception is a good thing.** For example: everyone
  arrives to work late but you’re the exception, or most people can’t make it to
  the gym consistently but you faithfully log your workout day after day.
  However, **when it comes to personal accountability, Miller explains we don’t
  want to be the exception.** He explains that when we believe we are the
  exception with personal accountability we create a roadblock that impedes our
  progress. To steer clear of this roadblock when you start to think others
  “should really hear this” instead ask a QBQ like “how can I use this in my own
  life?”

  "The moment we stop being accountable–by blaming, complaining, thinking like a
  victim, or procrastinating–we also stop learning, taking ownership, acting
  creatively, or being of service. And the trust we've built with others will
  quickly evaporate."

> "The moment we stop being accountable–by blaming, complaining, thinking like a victim, or procrastinating–we also stop learning, taking ownership, acting creatively, or being of service. And the trust we've built with others will quickly evaporate." _\- Flipping the Switch, page 3_

“But it wasn’t my fault! He did it, but I told him not to.” **Blame is rather common today.** It runs rampant in organizations and families large and small. We blame others, others blame us. Ironically we even blame others for blaming; but, what good does blaming do? Author and coach John Miller believes that we can overcome this tendency and instead begin to take ownership and transform our lives and our organizations in the process.

In _Flipping the Switch_, Miller explains that there are five fundamental values or principles that encourage personal accountability and when applied help us flip the switch and transform our lives. The five values are **learning**, **ownership**, **creativity**, **service**, and **trust**. Learning how to rewire these values into your life all starts with asking better questions.

### Ask the Question Behind the Question

Miller explains that the Question Behind the Question (QBQ) is a tool that helps us to take personal responsibility. QBQs begin with what or how, contain the word I, and are focused on action. However, Miller points out that **not all questions are created equal**. Incorrect Questions (IQ) ask why, when, or who. Asking why leads to complaining, when encourages procrastination, and who promotes blame.
