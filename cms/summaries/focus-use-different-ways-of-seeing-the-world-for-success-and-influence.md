  ### Real Work Requires Focus


  > "Focus is crucial to those of us who create, because creating is so
  difficult without it."- Focus, page 16


  For many of us, that little icon on our email program is powerful enough to
  draw us away from what we were doing. Everytime. We compulsively check to see
  what just came in. And whatever just came in probably has something that
  requires responding to and includes something that needs to be done. Halfway
  through completing that brand new task, the compelling chirp from our phone
  alerts us to a new text message – which, let’s face it, is practically
  impossible to ignore. Then someone pops their head through the cubical door as
  the phone rings. The next thing we know, it is noon – and that Big Important
  Task (you know, the one that actually matters) – is still sitting largely
  untouched. But that’s ok, we come back fresh from lunch to start on it again.
  This time, however, the urge to check Facebook, Twitter and our favourite
  blogs for new posts is so strong we don’t even realize we’re checking them
  until it is too late. By mid afternoon, the urgent, but unimportant tasks have
  piled up on our desks and inboxes, so that Big Important Task is going to have
  to wait until tomorrow. And the cycle begins again.


  It is pretty obvious that it is impossible to do real, important work with all
  these distractions. Babauta points out that creating is a completely separate
  process from consuming information and communicating with others. Obviously,
  we need communication and consumption – not just for succeeding in what we do,
  but also for inspiration and collaboration that feeds our creativity. That
  being said, **_every time we pop into email (communication) or check the
  latest blog posts (consumption), our brain switches gears and we lose our
  ability to create_**.


  It gets worse. The more we do this, Babauta says, the more we train our brains
  to need that fix of communication and consumption. We literally click, tweet
  and email our way to a very real addiction. As long as we are drawn away from
  creating, we are unable to do the work that matters – work that will change
  our lives and the world in some small way.


  Believe it or not, that’s not the worst of it. Distraction does more than just
  affect our ability to create. All the distractions caused by the constant
  barrage of our connectedness can also negatively affect our peace of mind,
  stress levels and, ultimately, our happiness. Our mind needs rest and, if we
  don’t disconnect, the stress can affect us in ways we don’t often realize. But
  there is hope, Babauta promises. His prescription for the distraction junkies
  among us are some simple steps we can take to break free and learn to focus.

  ### Steps To Getting Amazing Things Done


  > "1) Find Something Amazing to work on. 2) Clear away everything else. 3)
  Focus on that Something Amazing."- Focus, page 88-89


  This is where living a focused life comes in. We need to be working on Amazing
  Things. We want to accomplish Amazing Things. But all of life’s distractions
  get in the way. This is where the simple three step system comes in. This is
  an everyday thing – right out of the gate we want to be finding that Something
  Amazing and working on it **_before we do anything else_**. Yes, there are
  important emails to respond to and phone calls that need to be made. But this
  comes first. The purpose isn’t to be rigid and locked into only one thing –
  it’s great to have a few projects on the go. That way, every morning, we can
  work on the one that gets us the most excited, that we feel the most energized
  by and passionate about, that day. Procrastination and distraction lose some
  of their power when held up against a project that makes us come alive. If you
  don’t know what that Something Amazing is just yet, Babauta has some advice on
  that too – he lists ideas to get us started and then lets us know that we
  aren’t ‘locked into’ it – we can always try out something tomorrow. The key is
  to be in the present and let all else fade away. You might just be amazed at
  what you can accomplish!

  ### Disconnect


  > "Without great solitude no serious work is possible."- Pablo Picasso, quoted
  in Focus, page 19


  Just like with any addiction, you gotta go cold turkey. At least to start.
  What Babauta recommends is to unplug (quite literally) for some time to just
  give your mind some desperately needed rest. You’re going to want to shut off
  your email program, cell phone, Twitter, IM, blogs, TV, etc. You probably even
  need to unplug your Internet connection or Wi-Fi. This will end the stream of
  distractions. And, (after the panic wears off), you’ll be amazed at how much
  more quickly you’ll be able to complete typical tasks.


  Now, spend some time creating, reading, get outside, find somewhere quiet and
  reflect. When I do this, I am always amazed at how valuable it is and how
  refreshed I am when I’m done. Then, once you’ve obtained a bit of mental
  sanity again, dip your toe back into the river of information.


  The key to being effective with this is to separate your times of focus with
  times of consumption and communication. Don’t try to mix them. Instead, spend
  some time connected – say 15 minutes, and then some time disconnected – say 45
  minutes. Set a timer and when your connected time ends, unplug. You have to
  experiment to find out the best ratio for yourself and the type of work you
  do. Speaking of the type of work you do, this brings us to the second meaning
  of focus. This is focus in the broader sense – what commitments, projects,
  goals and tasks do you have on your plate? Here’s where the application of a
  focused life offers real leverage.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Focus_ was an excellent follow up to Leo Babauta’s previous book, [_The Power
  of Less_](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/the-power-of-less/). When you’ve
  simplified your life down to the essentials, as he teaches in [_The Power of
  Less_](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/the-power-of-less/) – the next step
  is to direct your focus, like beams of sunlight with a magnifying glass, onto
  those few essentials, thereby intensifying your results and the quality of
  your life. I’m inspired by Leo’s life and writing and I hope that you feel
  encouraged to eliminate some distractions and hone your focus.

We are living in an Age of Distraction; an always-on culture that is barraged from every direction with text messages, email, cell phones, TV, twitter, blogs, IM and 24” monitors filled with 13 open windows. It was supposed to make us more efficient. In many ways it has. However, it has the power to destroy our ability to focus. For many of us, all these distractions have become addictions. They have also become a crutch – a constant excuse that keeps us from doing truly important work – work the world needs us to do. We need focus if we want to accomplish anything of value. That’s why Babauta wrote this book; to help us regain our focus.
