  ### Audit Your Attention


  > "Attention works much like a muscle—use it poorly and it can wither; work it
  well and it grows."- Focus, page 4


  I find it interesting that in English the verb we commonly utilize to refer to
  the use of attention is “to pay.” We pay attention, not temporarily part with
  or receive without effort. Pay, that is a commitment, it implies a
  transaction, an exchange. You are giving some of your attention to receive
  something in return. What kind of investment do you currently receive for your
  attention?


  We budget, at least hopefully, our money but how well do we budget where to
  spend our attention? Do we spend our attention as well as we spend our money?
  We talk about priorities but do those receive our full attention or only what
  is left over? The simple practice of jotting down what you think about during
  the day or what your mind wanders to when working on other projects can aid
  you in fixing your lapses in attention.


  Goleman quotes an economist who said, in 1977 in regards to the increasing
  amount of information in the world that, “A wealth of information creates a
  poverty of attention.”


  Knowing where your attention lies is the first step to better investing it and
  avoid attention poverty. The good news is you can start small.

  ### Reflect


  > "Setting aside some regular reflective time in the daily or weekly schedule
  might help us get beyond the firefight-of-the-day mentality, to take stock and
  look ahead."- Focus, page 2-3


  Once we audit our attention and then recharge we will have enough attention at
  our disposal that we can invest it in ways that help to pay dividends in the
  future. Goleman explains that having a dedicated time to step back from the
  day to day habits and rituals allows us to reflect and grow. He cites examples
  of Congressmen, professors, and CEOs who all agree that “you need to find some
  quiet time in your day just to reflect.” With a few short minutes we gauge
  where we are and lessons we’ve learned and where to go next.

  ### Ring A Gong


  > "Tightly focused attention gets fatigued—much like an overworked muscle—when
  we push to the point of cognitive exhaustion. The signs of mental fatigue,
  such as a drop in effectiveness and a rise in distractedness and irritability,
  signify that the mental effort needed to sustain focus has depleted."- Focus,
  page 56


  Goleman shares a story about witnessing a meeting where the participants were
  anything but interested, with a few checking email on their smartphones. Then
  one of the participants said “time for some mindfulness moments” then stood
  and rang a gong. Golman remarked, “We all sat there together in silence for a
  few moments until the gong rang again, and then resumed our meeting—but with
  renewed energy. With this cue the group is able to pause, clear their heads
  and have a renewed sense of focus.”


  Our attention is limited, when exhausted it is highly ineffective. Think about
  how many times you have to read something when you are tired before it starts
  to make sense. The good news is that once attention is lost it can be found
  again. The physical act of ringing a gong, or something else can provide
  enough of a reminder to pause, regroup, and then draw your thoughts back to
  where they were before you got too far off track. We can, in essence,
  replenish our emptied attention span. In contrast, surfing the web or watching
  TV will actually continue to deplete attention because of the stimulation.
  Therefore, to effectively recharge your supply, be smart about what you do
  with your breaks.

  I enjoy reading articles and links on Twitter, it is a personally curated fire
  hose of information tailored to my interests. However, because it is so
  information rich I can spend FAR too much time when I should be focused on
  doing other things, like studying for finals. So I decided to start tracking
  how much time I spend on Twitter or reading articles so I could audit my
  attention. I also moved my Twitter client to a screen on my phone that it now
  takes six swipes/taps to access. Now these acts might sound too simple to be
  effective but they were enough of a gong ringing to stop me before my
  attention was completely diverted. For me, seeing the results of my audit was
  enough to jolt me into a different behavior. I have tried to use this
  attention that I had previously allocated elsewhere to do more thinking,
  writing and reflecting. The result is I have gained some “obvious” insights in
  solving problems that I failed to previously see and overall seem to be in a
  better mood.

  While the link between attention and excellence remains hidden most of the
  time, it ripples through almost everything we seek to accomplish.

Earlier this week I had lunch with my wife’s father in law. The restaurant was reasonably busy but I noticed that several of the people at the occupied tables had their heads down and thumbs scrolling some sort of device. This is not a comment on technology, rather one on our attention. There are more distractions than ever before, and we can have the world in our pocket. Nevertheless, our attention is an extremely scarce resource rivaled perhaps only by our time. Attention is a finite resource that we must constantly decide where to allocate.

We must continually strike a balance between not paying enough attention to something such as family members and friends with paying so much attention that no details escapes us. (Do you need to remember the license plate number of each car you see on your way to work?)

Daniel Goleman, the author of _Focus_, explains that distractions are more than minor annoyances. They have longer lasting impacts. For example, being distracted while reading creates gaps in comprehension. How many things are you doing right now? In addition to reading this article you may have music playing in the background, or a podcast, you may also be working on a project in another window. How well have you been focusing on what you are reading? Time for a quiz, who did I have lunch with this week?

I had lunch with my father, my wife’s father-in-law would be my father. It may have taken you a second to recall this detail, or you may have skipped over it altogether in your less than focused state. Don’t feel bad, Goleman uses a similar test in the book, which I failed, and also shamed me into rereading the previous few pages before my attention started to wander. The point is: our attention is a finite resource that once squandered takes time to regenerate. Most of us admit that we could be more focused and that doing so would produce better results. So why aren’t we more focused?
