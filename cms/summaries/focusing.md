  ### Focusing: The subtle skill needed for psychotherapy


  > "If what happens does not feel good, ‘like fresh air,’ then it isn’t really
  therapy that is happening."- Focusing, page 198


  The The Big Idea of this book is the practice itself. The book is fairly short
  and spends most of the time explaining the process and how to do it. This
  summary will most likely not be long enough to fully describe focusing in
  enough detail that you can use it, but I will give you a sense of it. The
  important thing to know is basically described in the quotation: **if you’re
  trying to do therapy and it’s not working, go buy this book and learn the
  technique**. Numerous published research papers support this point.


  The focusing process consists of six steps, but these steps often end up
  blurring together for experienced focusers.


  1\. **Clear a space**. In order to think about the problems that are vexing
  you, you need to clear some mental space. This is like how when cleaning or
  unpacking a room one first needs space to move and to think.


  2\. **Find a felt sense**. The felt sense is the deep feeling you have of a
  problem or situation. The felt sense is in the body/unconscious, so give
  yourself a minute or two to find it—don’t just try to answer the question by
  thinking about it.


  3\. **Get a handle**. Find a word, short phrase, or image that really captures
  the felt sense.


  4\. **Resonate**. Go back and forth between the felt sense and the handle to
  make sure it feels right. Often the felt sense will shift at this point.
  That’s a good thing!


  5\. **Ask**. Ask questions like “What about this situation makes me feel so
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_?” This prompts your body and mind to come to deeper mutual
  understanding.


  6\. **Receive**. Welcome what came. Even though the process is probably not
  finished, be grateful for the progress you’ve made.


  As I said, these steps might not be enough, but if they seem interesting then
  I highly recommend getting a copy of _Focusing_. I would also recommend it to
  anyone doing therapy with a therapist or on their own.


  Finally, while the book doesn’t emphasize this, there is a brief discussion at
  the end about how the same focusing technique can be used to make intellectual
  and creative breakthroughs by allowing you to **get a better sense of the
  problem and develop it beyond your current declarative understanding** of it.
  I can’t speak to this yet myself, but it strikes me as a huge potential source
  of value for creative professionals and knowledge workers.

  ### Facing Truth


  > "What is true is already so. Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse. Not
  being open about it doesn’t make it go away. And because it’s true, it is what
  is there to be interacted with. Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.
  People can stand what is true, for they are already enduring it."- Focusing,
  page 162


  This single paragraph above was what prompted me to read the book in the first
  place. I had seen it quoted online and was curious to discover its origin.


  The context in which this quotation appears is in fact _also_ in The Listening
  Manual, in a part about expressing your own feelings when listening. The point
  being presented is that other people want to hear your honest feelings, not
  just the feelings you wish you had or the ones you think are appropriate.
  Gendlin also points out that, “other people don’t care how good or wise or
  beautiful you are. Only you care all that much. It is not harmful to the other
  person if you look stupid or imperfect.”


  While originally written for this relational context, these words can be
  applied much more broadly, as a recitation to encourage yourself to be brave
  in situations where you find yourself potentially facing an uncomfortable
  truth. In doing so, many people find that opening up to reality as it is
  (rather than as you want it to be) provides a release in tension, much like
  the one described in the opening quote.

  ### Methods of Charitable Interpretation


  > "If you find it hard to accept someone with unlovely qualities, think of the
  person as being up against these qualities inside. It is usually easy to
  accept the person inside who is struggling against these very qualities. As
  you listen, you will then discover that person."- Focusing, page 140


  This quotation speaks for itself. It might not be _easy_ to do, but it is
  straightforward. There is a section of the book called The Listening Manual,
  which outlines a variety of techniques and approaches for improving your
  ability to listen to others, both individually and in a group context.


  Another related quotation from this section is:


  _“In arguments both people endlessly repeat their positions, over and over. It
  saves a lot of time if you_ **_restate the other’s position_**_.”_


  What both of these quotes have in common is that they are specific techniques
  to improve your understanding of and empathy for the other person. By seeing
  them as a person inside grappling with flaws, and by seeking to understand and
  articulate their point of view, you validate the parts of them that want to be
  accepted and understood. This is essentially specific advice for how to
  maximally act on the [Principle of
  Charity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).
f_conclusion: >-
  I realize this can be a tough question, but I’m going to ask it anyway:
  **what’s an area of your life that you suspect you might be holding back from
  the truth?** What might you gain by allowing yourself to go there? Remember:
  you can stand what is true, for you are already living it.
f_quote-2: >-
  "Often this transferred knowledge seems to be part of a tough problem, and it
  might be expected that this would make you feel worse. After all, you now know
  something bad that you didn’t know before. Logically, you should feel worse.
  Yet you don’t. You feel better."

**Why does psychotherapy work for some people but not for others?** Starting in the 50s, Eugene Gendlin, author of _Focusing_, set out to answer this question. He and other researchers discovered that there is a very simple answer: the patient’s approach. It was apparent from simply listening to a recording of the session which patients were going to succeed and which would not. They also discovered that **the successful approach can be taught**, and that it has powerful uses beyond therapy and trauma. Focusing is the skill of approaching yourself in that way.
