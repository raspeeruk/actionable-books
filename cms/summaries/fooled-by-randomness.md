  ### Understand Data Analysis


  > "Consider that you have a very small number of poor people and the rest
  clustering around the middle class. The mean will be lower than the median.
  Take a population of 10 people, 9 having a net worth of $30,000 and 1 having a
  net worth of $1,000. The average net worth is $27,100 and 9 out of 10 people
  will have above average wealth."- Fooled by Randomness, page 106


  The reverse is true too, 1 millionaire would raise the average and make 9 out
  of 10 below average wealth. We may think by definition not more than 50% can
  be above or below average. We sometimes use _average_ to refer to _mean_ or
  _median,_ but they are not the same. The key is that if the samples are not
  statistically symmetrical the mean or _average value_ will not describe the
  median or _probable distribution_ of the samples. We can see there may not be
  a single sample that fits the description of the average. Notice one rare
  occurrence changes statistics significantly.


  When we confuse mean and median, we draw conclusions that are wrong but seem
  logical. For instance, 90% of drivers consider themselves above average. We
  may think they must be wrong, only 50% can be above average. Not so. If 10%
  are very bad drivers who create a high percentage of accidents and violations,
  90% may be above average. However, Taleb points out we tend to overvalue our
  skill, and I suspect most drivers do. Perhaps we assume we have a 50% chance
  of a successful marriage because half of all marriages end in divorce. Not
  true. People who divorce once will often divorce again which creates a
  statistical bias. It appears divorce is as common as a successful marriage. In
  fact, most marriages are successful.


  It is important to check facts and conclusions when we analyze data as there
  are many ways to get it wrong. How do we become more aware of relevant
  probability? Read on to the Insights.

  ### Ignore the Noise


  > "Some so-called wise and rational persons often blame me for ‘ignoring’
  possible valuable information in the daily newspaper and refusing to discount
  the details of the noise as ‘short-term events.’ Some of my employers have
  blamed me for living on a different planet."- Fooled by Randomness, page 68


  Information is often just noise and irrelevant to good decisions and sound
  ideas. Oversimplifying is dangerous we may overlook significant rare events
  but if we look for every possibility, there are too many to comprehend. Taleb
  talks about incurring emotional torture or burnout focusing on too much
  information. He says he is aware he needs to ruminate on information, but he
  can only do so if he is somewhat deprived.


  I have an internet connection but not television. I read the newspaper
  selectively. I could not tell you about the latest drama in Washington or
  Hollywood. Most of that information passes through a brief period of relevance
  and fades away. If it is significant, it will keep showing up, and I will
  discover the trend. I am filtering out the noise and concentrating on the
  significant. I feel more connected in meaningful ways but to casual observers
  I seem disconnected.

  ### Evaluate Risk by its Potential Impact


  > "Accordingly, it is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is
  how much is made when it happens that should be the consideration. How
  frequent the profit is irrelevant; it is the magnitude of the outcome that
  counts."- Fooled by Randomness, page 102


  Avoid risk when you cannot afford the loss. Taleb uses Russian Roulette as an
  example. A single bullet is loaded randomly in a six chamber revolver and when
  the player pulls the trigger they have a 1 in 6 chance of death. The
  probability of loss is small but if it occurs, it is catastrophic. Taleb
  mentions he lost a friend who played the game. I had an acquaintance that lost
  his left eye playing the game. The bullet lodged in his skull, but he
  survived. He realized he nearly took his life for a simple thrill. The reality
  is some risks are not worth taking.


  I am an Insurance Broker. In the insurance industry, we call this adverse
  selection. We have to charge more overall than it costs to cover the average
  client because a few will cost much more than the average. We employ
  actuaries, mathematicians who use the law of large numbers to ensure we have a
  large enough pool of low-risk clients to offset the high-risk clients and
  enough reserves to cover the unexpected but statistically probable losses. We
  balance lots of small gains, and a few big losses to keep the business
  profitable and the clients protected. We have the assets to protect clients
  from a chance occurrence that we can cover but would be an overwhelming
  personal loss.


  In life, we often make the mistake of using small numbers to calculate risk.
  We take a risk, hedge our bets with the odds that if we do something a few
  times it’s not likely to occur. We do it, it becomes comfortable, and then we
  forget the risk. As the number of repetitions increases so does the
  probability of the unlikely event. Eventually, odds are it will happen.
  Reality wins, always.
f_conclusion: >-
  The curious reader will appreciate this fresh perspective and exploration of
  provocative ideas that Taleb illuminates with a great amount of knowledge and
  understanding. Most importantly he stresses keeping an open mind and balancing
  logic and emotion. As he points out, “Researchers found that purely rational
  behavior on the part of humans can come from a defect in the amygdala that
  blocks the emotions of attachment, meaning that the subject is, literally, a
  psychopath.” We build loyalty to our ideas because they seem rational but
  strict adherence to beliefs looks like insanity, and we play the fool.

Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Wall Street Trader and innovation catalyst, challenges conventional logic with his discussion of probability from a more philosophical than mathematical perspective in _Fooled by Randomness._ The quote above is his axiom. His convincing argument is that we mistakenly attribute hard work and skill to success or failure we experience and observe instead of correctly identifying it as an instance of chance. When we maximize our probability of success, it does not maximize our gains unless our strategy includes protecting ourselves from a small chance of a large loss and betting on a large chance of small wins. We oversimplify creating generalizations and overlook anything we have not experienced. Some information we consider important is just a distraction and distorts our perception. Also, knowing where we get probability and how we can change our beliefs is more important than having a sophisticated model.

Of the many concepts worth practicing, I decided to touch on interpreting statistics and the significance of probability. The The Big Idea illustrates the common confusion between mean and median. This is one example of how we often misinterpret statistics.
