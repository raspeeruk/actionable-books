  ### Stop Performing. Start Experiencing.


  > "Try to remember this: It’s not a performance; it’s an experience."- Four
  Seconds, page 51


  I absolutely love this paradigm shift that the author proposes in the quote
  above. Think about the reality of our lives – what we do feels like a series
  of performances. Think about how we’re graded throughout school, our
  performance reviews in the workplace and the fact that many of us are paid for
  our performance – “even little things – leading a meeting, having a hallway
  conversation, sending an email – are followed by the silent but ever present
  question, ‘How’d that go?’” Here’s the kicker: living our lives with the
  perspective that everything is a performance lead to stress, unhappiness and
  most often, mediocre performances. “If you want to get better at anything, you
  need to experiment with an open mind, to try and fail, to willingly accept and
  learn from any outcome,” Bregman writes.


  When you make this slight mindset shift, you’re taking the “pressure” off a
  short lived moment in time. There’s going to always be someone there to judge
  your performance and that will never change. When you’re going through an
  “experience”, you remain fluid and agile. Yes, you may “bomb” your speech but
  at least you did it. Now you have an experience to lean on to do better next
  time.


  Easier said than done, right? Of course, luckily for us Bergman gives us some
  advice. “So how can we let go of performance in favor of experience? –
  complete this sentence: This is what it feels like to \_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the
  blank). IE: This is what it feels like to be in love; this is what it feels
  like to be nervous for a sales meeting; etc.” Try it out!

  ### Not everything needs to be sustainable


  > "For something to be a great success, it doesn’t have to last forever."-
  Four Seconds, page 236


  Today, things change… fast! What got yourself to where you are today isn’t
  going to get you to where you want to be tomorrow. We’ve seen throughout
  history brilliant ideas, companies, processes that are incredible. Then they
  aren’t. Nothing is perfect and nothing lasts forever. We’re going to have to
  evolve as individuals, leaders, and businesses to keep up with the changing
  economy, business landscape and competition. By having this paradigm of
  looking at solutions and ideas as temporary rather than permanent, it becomes
  easier to commit to. It becomes easier to implement. It becomes easier to get
  others involved. It becomes easier to pay for.


  Keep in mind that we change. Situations change. The people around us change.
  And the tools we use should change, too.

  ### Let People Fail – or Almost Fail


  > "Learning anything – isn’t about doing it right."- Four Seconds, page 176


  We all learn differently. That’s been drilled into our heads from the time
  we’re young. What we also know to be true, although it’s not ideal, is that
  failure helps us learn. “Our natural instinct is to prevent all failure, but
  doing so stunts growth,” writes Bregman. Consider this example:


  _“If an employee comes to you with a presentation that doesn’t meet your
  expectations, what do you do? Take it, fix it and present it yourself? Tell
  him what he’s doing wrong and ask him to fix it? Allow him to present it
  without making changes and let him face the consequences? Each choice is
  legitimate in the right circumstances.”_


  What would you do? Your job as a leader is to determine and gauge the
  circumstance correctly. It’s certainly easier said than done, but luckily,
  Bregman gives us some questions we can ask ourselves, when facing these types
  of situations:


  *   What’s the risk, the consequences of failure?

  *   Is it time critical?

  *   Will mistakes destroy the person’s reputation forever?

  *   Will it being an effective learning experience?


  Failure is a valuable part of the growth and development of people in all
  areas of our lives. Being a leader or parent puts us in a position to make
  determinations on if failing is going to help or hurt the person and their
  development. Whether we are succeeding or failing, it’s all part of the
  experiences that make up who we are, our skill sets and abilities. Once we
  learn to embrace failure and see it as an opportunity to grow, the faster
  we’ll get to where we, our teams or our children are trying to get.

  _Four Seconds_ is an enjoyable read filled with ideas, strategies and tactics
  that will help you to make better, more impactful decisions. Some of these
  ideas will help you today, others will prove helpful later in life.
