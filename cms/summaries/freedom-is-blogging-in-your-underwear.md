  ### Your Own Electronic Croft


  > "Thanks to the Internet, we all have a little electronic 'croft'—an
  electronic smallholding—to call our own: what is commonly referred to as our
  own digital identity, which we can cultivate, like a small farm, however we
  see fit."- Freedom Is Blogging In Your Underwear, location 161


  I love the analogy that MacLeod uses for blogging because it’s so apt: “My
  grandfather was a Scottish highlands “crofter”—i.e., a small-time, mostly
  self-sufficient tenant farmer with his own little patch of land, who raised
  sheep and grew potatoes, turnips, and other stuff.” The internet allows us to
  have our own “croft,” a little plot of land to call our own and do what we
  want with it. So much of the freedom of blogging is that the potential of an
  internet audience is so vast that we can be as unique and specialized as we
  want (unlike a plot of land, we don’t have to worry about whether something
  will grow or not). If you want to blog horror movie reviews, you can. If you
  want to share gluten free recipes, you can do that too. Blogging offers us an
  “electronic identity”. But, as MacLeod warns, this isn’t an identity separate
  from your professional identity: they are all one. While certainly the
  internet gives us a great deal of anonymity, those who truly benefit from it
  know that it’s an extension of your professional life. When harnessed properly
  the two will work in concert with one another, and many new and exciting
  opportunities will reveal themselves.

  ### Put In the Time


  > "But no matter how easy it gets, art still remains an expensive,
  time-consuming, labor-intensive, pain-in-the-ass thing to make. I still get up
  early in the morning and get to work, every day. I still do the long hours,
  every day."- Freedom Is Blogging In Your Underwear, location 264


  Hugh MacLeod is quick to point out that blogging takes work. A lot of work. If
  you’re looking to make a quick buck then go elsewhere, because you’re going to
  learn, very quickly, that successful blogging is about the long haul. It’s
  like any job– passion is paramount. Your readers’ will easily detect when
  you’re “faking it”. As Hugh pointed out in the quote I used to lead this GEM,
  despite the fact that his office is in his home, he still rises early and goes
  to work. He has a set routine, and he sticks to it. The “office” may be down
  the hall, and he may be able to show up in his underwear, but it’s still where
  he goes to work and to create things. As someone who has dabbled in blogging,
  I can attest to the fact that this can often be the most difficult aspect of
  blogging: the self-discipline. To be truly successful, you need to devise a
  schedule for yourself so that it feels as though you’re working a 9 to 5. Set
  aside a spot in your home, whether it’s a small nook under the stairs or a
  writing shed in your garden – a place that’s dedicated only for your blogging
  – if you intend to make a career out of it. Do whatever you can to approximate
  “showing up at the office”. When it seems real, you’ll put in the time and see
  real results.

  ### Cheap. Easy. Global Media.


  > "CheapEasyGlobal is the big story. And it’s here now. It has arrived. And
  it’s permanent. And there’s not a damn thing anyone can do about it, save for
  a nuclear holocaust. And yes, the changes will be vast. In fact, they already
  are."- Freedom Is Blogging In Your Underwear, location 229


  Guess what? Your croft is free! Blogging allows us to get our “art” out there
  to an audience for next to nothing; your biggest investment is time. As
  MacLeod writes, “…I use the Internet to sell it \[my art\]. I don’t do
  galleries or get my stuff in newspapers. I just publish it on my blog, I post
  it in my online gallery, I send it along in my daily newsletter, and then
  people buy it. Yes, it’s easy. Compared to getting discovered by the New York
  Times, United Features Syndicate, or a blue-chip New York art gallery, it’s
  REALLY easy.”


  Blogging has truly levelled the playing field, and we all need to take
  advantage of it. In fact, as MacLeod so bluntly puts it, we’d be stupid not
  to. He quotes Clay Shirky as saying, “So forget about blogs and bloggers and
  blogging and focus on this—the cost and difficulty of publishing absolutely
  anything, by anyone, into a global medium, just got a whole lot lower. And the
  effects of that increased pool of potential producers is going to be vast.”


  The possibilities are endless, and the journey that cultivating our digital
  croft can take us on is completely unknown. In fact, while writing this piece,
  I took a short break to visit one of the blogs I frequent and discovered that
  the author was given an opportunity to write an essay for an internationally
  published magazine because one of the editors stumbled upon her blog. That
  alone is inspiring! Where will your journey take you?
f_conclusion: >-
  To be honest, Hugh MacLeod’s _Freedom Is Blogging In Your Underwear_ isn’t the
  book I anticipated. If you’re looking for a book that will give you advice on
  monetizing your blog, how many blog posts you should write a day to keep your
  audience interested, and ideas on how to aggressively build your audience,
  then this book isn’t the one for you. On the other hand, if you’re looking for
  a fun, quick, irreverent read (replete with MacLeod’s signature cartoons on
  the back of business cards!), that will light a fire under you to get that
  blog you’ve always wanted to write going, then pick up this book. Blogging,
  when done for the right reasons, can mean true freedom artistically and offer
  an incredibly flexible lifestyle. And, if you’re so inclined, an opportunity
  to show up for work in your underwear.

Blogs. We all know what they are, but few of us truly know how to harness the power of a blog to transform our lives. But as Hugh MacLeod argues in his recent book, _Freedom Is Blogging In Your Underwear_, the power isn’t monetary, it’s freedom. A decade before the publication of his book, MacLeod was a struggling cartoonist. He knew he was talented, and was smart enough to realize that sitting around waiting for his cartoons to be syndicated in newspapers was futile. So he established his blog, [GapingVoid.com](http://gapingvoid.com/) to showcase them. Through sharing his talent and passion with the world, he quickly gained a dedicated following and became one of the first visual artists to launch his career entirely online. It’s quite a feat, but you too can do the same… if you bring enough passion and dedication.
