  ### Get Fuzzy


  > "A fuzzy goal is one that 'motivates the general direction of the work,
  without blinding the team to opportunities along the journey.'"- Gamestorming,
  page 7


  Like Chris Columbus, Magellan and other explorers of old, we need to be ok
  with having only a vague sense of where we’re going. (India, anyone?)
  _Gamestorming_ co-authors, Dave Gray, Sunni Brown and James Macanufo suggest
  that, as leaders, it’s ok to be unsure of the exact specifics of how we’re
  going to get to where we want to go… or even if where we think we want to go
  is, in fact, our best bet. The name of the game is **keeping an open mind**,
  and maintaining a willingness to explore a multitude of potential avenues
  before committing to one course of action. You don’t need to “know it all” to
  be a strong leader in the 21st century. Instead, your role should really be to
  identify the objective, and then be able to motivate your team to work towards
  a solution. As an example…


  In a [conversation with Roger
  Martin](../videos/roger-martin-all-bets-are-off-or-should-be-at-least/) (Dean
  of Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto), Roger outlined
  to me an exercise he had his MBA students work through as a part of their
  course. The situation was Toronto traffic, and the challenge was to identify
  better systems for managing the flow of people in an average day. Now, you
  don’t need to know Toronto to understand the magnitude of this challenge.
  Imagine any city of 6 million people and you’ll start to get the picture.
  Roger’s objective was **not** to define the ideal solution and have his team
  build it. Instead, his role was (a) to define the problem, fuzzy though it was
  (improve Toronto traffic), and (b) to engage his “team” in creating a
  solution. In _Gamestorming_, we explore the engagement aspect of the
  leadership role. How, exactly, do you get people actively involved in creating
  a solution to a problem this large, and this fuzzy?


  In the following two Insights, we look at two tools that Gray, Brown and
  Macanufo suggest for getting people engaged.

  ### Defy labels (at least initially)


  > "Ask people to sort the sticky note into three columns... Naming the columns
  too early will force them back into familiar, comfortable patterns. Remember
  that in creative work we are trying to help people generate and see new
  patterns."- Gamestorming, page 21


  This was another great takeaway for me – label things **later**. So often when
  I’m leading a brainstorming session, I break the whiteboard into columns
  (good) and label the columns to help create clarity (bad). Labelling itself is
  not inherently bad, but labelling things _too early_ can be limiting on the
  creativity being generated. Suddenly ideas that don’t fit into the three
  arbitrary categories seem like “bad” ideas.


  Instead, get all your ideas (recorded on sticky notes) on the board, sorted by
  _relationship_ (how do the ideas themselves relate, without an imposing
  structure?) rather than the three, pre-defined headings. Then, by all means
  label your columns, so long as it’s **after** all the ideas are sorted by
  relationship.


  In the process of Gamestorming, the familiar and the comfortable are
  counter-productive. Acknowledge their siren’s call, and do your best to steer
  the group back into uncharted territory.

  ### Embrace Artifacts


  > "An artifact can be anything from a piece of paper to a sticky note or index
  card. Artifacts make it easier to keep track of information by making it a
  part of the environment."- Gamestorming, page 17


  By their very nature, complex problems are, well, complex. Perhaps you could
  hold all the information about the problem in your head, but why would you, if
  you have the opportunity to use props and reminders instead? In
  _Gamestorming_, these “props and reminders” are called “artifacts”, and can
  take on a variety of appearances. As suggested in the quote above, artifacts
  (certainly in the business world) often come in the form of sticky-notes,
  index cards or pieces of paper. They don’t have to be paper, however. Have you
  ever used the salt and pepper shaker to tell a story over the breakfast table?
  Those salt and pepper shakers just became artifacts in your story.


  Too often, we rely strictly on words to attempt to describe a complex
  situation or problem. If you’re not in the habit of doing so already, use
  artifacts where possible. The great thing about sticky notes, specifically, is
  that they can be laid out spatially (on a wall or white board, for example) to
  explain complex relationships that we might not otherwise be able to
  articulate. They can also be rearranged as we talk through ideas and start to
  test out different relationships.


  In a brainstorming session, sticky notes and index cards also allow people to
  jot down their own ideas, rather than wait for their turn to have the
  facilitator write their idea on the board (as is the case in traditional group
  brainstorming). Get people actively engaged by giving them the power to
  contribute on their own time, in their own words. Then get all the ideas (one
  per sticky note) on the board and start to look at the relationships. This
  simple twist on your traditional brainstorming process could have a huge
  impact.
f_conclusion: >-
  Considering the actual “instruction” part of _Gamestorming_ is only 52 pages,
  I took a crazy amount of notes as I read through it. Perhaps this speaks to
  the uniqueness of this book. Perhaps it’s a reflection of how many ideas it
  sparked for my own life and business. Regardless, I can comfortably say that
  it’s been a while since I so _enjoyed_ reading a business book. I don’t think
  I’m alone. At our core, we all love games – the chance to explore a new world
  and create, through a structured frame. _Gamestorming_ gives us the tools (and
  the confidence) to do so in our professional lives. But be warned; this is not
  a “one time thing”. As the authors themselves say, _“Those hoping for a
  ‘flavor of the month’ to rescue their failing business, or a quick fix, can
  look elsewhere. But those who approach gamestorming as a practice, worthy of
  careful study and ongoing skill-building work, will find here a path to rich
  rewards and personal fulfillment at work.”_

If you’ve read Dan Pink’s [_A Whole New Mind_](../summaries/a-whole-new-mind/) or Seth Godin’s [_Linchpin_](../summaries/linchpin/)_,_ you’re likely already aware that there’s a new skill set required for professional success in the 21st century. The days of following a step by step job description are dead, and the future belongs to those who can innovate; those who can “surprise and delight their customers and colleagues”. Which, of course, is easier said than done. Imagine my delight then when I came across a slim book called _Gamestorming: A Playbook for Innovators, Rulebreakers, and Changemakers._

Fully living up to its (sub)title, _Gamestorming_ is an easy-to-comprehend-and-apply guidebook to a new method of brainstorming; a world in which we use the basic foundations of **games** (yes, games) to think through challenging or sophisticated problems. The book provides not only 80 some-odd pre-built games (games that you can use immediately to take your brainstorming/meetings sessions to a whole new level), but also provides a comprehensive explanation of how games are designed and best utilized, allowing the reader to start to visualize their own potential games to use with colleagues and/or clients.

For those of us who were hardwired through our education to identify a _process_ for solving a problem, _Gamestorming_ offers a refreshing look at the real world we live in, and how we can navigate the challenges of our daily professional lives in a fun and productive manner.

I’m looking forward to it.
