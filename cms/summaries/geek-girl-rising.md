  ### Are you in the pain or pleasure business?


  > "Ask yourself: Are you starting this business because you’re in the pain
  business that is solving consumer problems? Or are you in the pleasure
  business because you want to be part of \[a ‘hot startup’\]?"- Geek Girl
  Rising, page 64


  Many of the women in the book share stories and examples of coming up with
  ideas to solve pressing problems that they or their friends were facing, but
  then being worried about others’ opinions of the worthiness of their ventures.
  This seemed especially true of start-ups that are addressing women’s issues.


  The front cover gives it away—too many people are building tech start-ups—but,
  as many of the stories admit, there’s still a long way to go from a start-up
  with potential to a business generating an ongoing repeatable income stream.


  There’s also a cautionary tale for start-up founders—“don’t drink the
  ‘start-up Kool Aid’. One founder explained that she had a really important
  mission to make mental health services more affordable online. But she was
  seduced into spending her first round of funding on the trappings she thought
  were required to be a successful start-up—the trendy office, the new branding,
  the beautiful website, the overseas freelance team—until she found that the
  beautiful website didn’t have functionality and she had paid for expensive
  garbage code.

  ### Are you prepared to use your networks?


  > "Men are six times more likely to ask their personal network of family and
  friends for money and nearly three times more likely to ask their business
  acquaintances for capital."- Geek Girl Rising, page 43


  As someone who’s always kept business and personal lives separate, this one
  was an eye opener. While the stories that explained the importance of really
  connecting and building a community, so that you understand your customers,
  really resonated, I hadn’t thought to involve them in the success of the
  venture.


  Others reinforced that no matter where you are on the learning curve, there is
  always something you’ve learned that you could teach to others—for example, by
  writing a blog or creating a video clip. And if you are doing it because you
  understand and want to connect with your community, as Michelle Phan, CEO of a
  digital beauty lifestyle empire, has done, then you get free feedback all the
  time about what your community (not audience, because that implies passively
  waiting) wants and needs.


  There’s also advice on how to deal with sexist or uninformed prospective
  investors, when you do start asking people to invest in your idea. Kathryn
  Minshew, CEO of the Muse advises young women to learn the “stare and steer”
  technique. This involves a dead stare, with a straight face, for one second
  longer than necessary at the person, then learning to steer the conversation
  to another topic. This technique avoids the risk of an older male reacting
  badly to being told off by a young woman, and it sends an authoritative
  message that you can’t be pushed around.

  ### Nobody is as good as they are now when they first started


  > "You can’t give up on your goal because it didn’t work out the first time."-
  Geek Girl Rising, page 105


  There are many important messages here for girls and women, and men as well.
  Just because you aren’t good at something initially, doesn’t mean you can’t
  like it. And just because you don’t understand something quickly, doesn’t mean
  you will never get it. I especially liked the story of Microsoft engineer Dona
  Sarkar, who failed her first computer science class but repeated it and found
  that she had learned a lot the second time round. As she saw it, her male
  colleagues had three to five years of practice in high school, which she
  missed out on, so she was realistic about the time it would take for her to
  learn the basic lessons. As a bonus, she now has a much better grasp on the
  frustration of normal users, who don’t understand the power or limitations of
  their computer system.


  The reality is that most start-ups fail, so part of the message of the book is
  to normalize failure by “failing forward”—encouraging us all to recognise that
  innovation is inherently about trial and error but success comes from taking
  some learning and insights that informs your next effort.


  However, some of the research indicates that there may be a difference in how
  many women are raised to strive for perfection (an unrealistic first goal)
  rather than to strive to get better over time. As one engineer said, “I wish
  more women knew that you don’t have to be the best engineer, or even an
  engineer, to start or work with a \[tech\] company.” We can start with “good
  enough” and then get better.
f_conclusion: >-
  The overall message of this book is that just about anyone can participate in
  the tech revolution. It’s a rallying call to all of us who see problems in the
  world that we care about. One key thing that really resonated is to encourage
  all of us to shift from consumers to creators, and we can start as early or as
  late as we like.

> "If you truly want to become an entrepreneur, you have to do it with a sense of conviction, of passion, but most importantly, you \[have to\] want to solve the problem." _\- Geek Girl Rising, page 42_

The American statistics on women in tech are depressing, so I can only imagine the percentages of women in Tech in Australia, and other Western countries are even worse. But the real value for budding entrepreneurs, or anyone who wants to encourage female tech entrepreneurs, is the personal stories in this fascinating book.

What’s different is that many of the stories in _Geek Girl Rising: Inside the Sisterhood Shaking Up Tech_ are about failure, as well as success, and perhaps this is where women have an edge—we are more used to confiding our successes and our fears to our friends—so the book comes across as both inspiring and realistic about what is required to succeed.

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Are you in the pain or pleasure business?

The message is that promoting diversity in the tech world (and in all areas of society) is not charity, it’s a smart bet. Girls can learn that it is OK to be a princess and to build their own online castles too. All it requires is a meaningful problem, time, and persistence, and a bit of encouragement from your family and friends.
