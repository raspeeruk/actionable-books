  ### Gift or Burden


  > "'Sean,' she asked quietly, 'is this going to be a gift or a burden?'"- Get
  Off Your “But”, page 12


  Part of Stephenson’s previous work experience included time spent at the White
  House and the opportunity to meet and work under President Bill Clinton. He
  shares with us his Top 10 Lessons he found working with a top influential
  leader of our time. He applies many of those lessons directly into his book.
  For example, through story and vulnerability, Stephenson opens up about the
  physical disability he was born with and the choices that his parents and,
  subsequently he himself, had to make to decide how his life would be lived.
  This is an overarching theme I recognized throughout all the lessons – is this
  going to be a gift or a burden? Can you make a positive out of a negative? Are
  you going to wallow in your own pity or start taking action on what you can
  accomplish? There are plenty of things the author could focus on that he can’t
  do, but instead he focuses on what he can do. When this pivot happens
  throughout the many stories and examples provided you see the positive affects
  it has on the individual, sometimes in ways they weren’t even expecting. I
  actually would describe it as liberating. Deciding to shift towards a positive
  has the ability to actually liberate you into the world of what is possible.

  ### Fool Me Once


  > "Negativity doesn’t need your consent to affect you."- Get Off Your “But”,
  page 176


  I found this to be such a profound reminder of how negativity, through others
  or our own thoughts, can and will affects us. This notion is weaved throughout
  the author’s lessons. In particular through Lessons 5 (Choose Your Friends
  Wisely) and 6 (Take Full Responsibility) I think it becomes clear how you can
  take action against negativity that may be in your life. Examining your tribe
  and who you choose to spend time with plays an important role in the amount of
  negativity you experience. Equally, I think taking responsibility for your
  actions, where you are and the choices you make has an incredible ability to
  liberate you from a feeling of constant doom and gloom. Negativity isn’t
  something that you can opt out of like ordering a burger with no onions. Even
  the most positive and self-aware individuals are affected by it. Instead of
  focusing on what we can’t change, you can focus on what you can and that is
  deciding who and how much time you will spend with people and to what extent
  you will let negativity influence and control you.

  ### Who Said That?


  > "Choose the words you are saying to yourself wisely: they are creating your
  reality."- Get Off Your “But”, page 81


  There are many things that might hold us back from doing what we really love,
  making a choice, finding forgiveness, or moving forward. Whatever it may be,
  people tend to have a dialogue or story around why this is the case. Upon
  digging deeper into this, more often than not this underlying fear or
  self-doubt is coming from none-other than our own selves. So while it may feel
  as though there are things holding you back, likely it is really only
  yourself. So how do you break out of that? Following the lessons outlined by
  Stephenson is an obvious start, but I think the above quote is a simple and
  yet powerful reminder. We are the narrators of our own story, so take a moment
  to listen to what that narration is saying. If you don’t like it, then change
  the tune.

  your attention on determines what you accomplish, how you feel, and what you
  can handle in life.”_

> "It’s more fun to be the underdog anyway – it makes for much better stories." _\- Get Off Your “But”, page 21_

Sean Stephenson’s book _Get Off Your “But”: How to End Self-sabotage and Stand up for Yourself_ is a collection of simple life lessons that can be applied to both your personal and professional life. Baked in are real life tangible stories that both he and others have used to overcome challenges. This book isn’t rocket science, and even before picking it up I naively thought I might be able to finally unlock the secret to fear and doubt. Turns out, most of what the author shares with us are things we already know. Despite knowing them, they may be having a profound affect on where we are in life. Stephenson summarizes his findings with the following key lessons:

Lesson 1: Start Connecting  
Lesson 2: Watch What You Say to Yourself  
Lesson 3: Master Physical Confidence  
Lesson 4: Focus Your Focus  
Lesson 5: Choose Your Friends Wisely  
Lesson 6: Take Full Responsibility

Instead of going through each one, I decided to focus on areas that stuck out the most to me. Reading through you may find your own combination of lessons that stick out to you. The important thing you will find, though, is that ultimately you are the driver in this journey and whatever happens or doesn’t happen starts and ends with your own choices.

_“The ability to manage your focus is one of the greatest powers. What you put your attention on determines what you accomplish, how you feel, and what you can handle in life.”_

This book is about taking ownership of your life, your choices, and where you want to go. The lessons are designed to help you get the most out of any choices or changes you are willing to make to reach your goals. I am reminded again that ultimately the one person that can influence this the most is you. Think about a situation or a relationship that you feel is holding you back. Now instead of thinking about how it is preventing you from your goal, start thinking about what _you can do_, right now, to achieve it.
