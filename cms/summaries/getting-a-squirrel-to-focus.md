  ### ACORN


  > "Your message is competing against short attention spans, information
  overload and other mindless distractions."- Getting a Squirrel to Focus, page
  8


  While the amount of information being produced is expanding exponentially,
  unfortunately attention spans are decreasing. Dr. Scott suggests our attention
  spans are more like a squirrel’s than you might think! What’s the one thing
  that can increase a squirrel’s focus? An ACORN!


  Dr. Scott gives us the recipe to create an acorn for our listeners. This
  time-tested persuasive strategy can be applied to any presentation, sales
  call, conversation, interview or negotiation. The key is to take the time
  before your next conversation to think through your strategy and be sure to
  include the following ideas:


  **A – Audience** – Identify your audience’s WIIFM (What’s in it for me) and
  the relevance to them of the problem your message will solve.


  **C – Credibility** – Help them see why you are the right person to help them
  solve the problem.


  **O – Order of message** – Use the persuasive structure with your framed key
  message first.


  **R – Remember** – Make your message easy to remember by chunking information
  and use easy language, metaphors and mnemonics. A strong call to action also
  helps.


  **N – Need to connect** – Use strategies to engage them with emotion.

  ### Call to Action


  > "There is nothing worse than actually being persuaded but then walking out
  of the room and losing that feeling of wanting to change or to help or to
  act."- Getting a Squirrel to Focus, page 67


  After you’ve created your ACORN you still need to do one important thing.
  Whether you name it a call to action, a close or a conclusion, Dr. Scott
  describes three things that will make it better.


  1.  Be as specific as possible with what you are asking your audience to do.

  2.  Make it doable. What is the easiest way for them to start doing what you
  want?

  3.  Make it something they can do very soon after you ask. Time will diminish
  their commitment to the idea and they will forget.

  ### Remember me


  > "…our listening problem is not information overload….the real problem is
  organization underload."- Getting a Squirrel to Focus, page 52


  I work with very smart people in healthcare: pharmaceutical professionals and
  doctors. These scientific minds have loads of great information to share and
  usually have solid arguments. They are all competent speakers; they know how
  to stand, look at their audience, vary their voices and gesticulate. The
  trouble is, their audiences don’t listen closely to their message or act on
  it. For example, patient non-adherence is a huge barrier to optimal health
  outcomes.


  Why don’t patients listen to doctors? While the doctors are great at the
  science of the treatment they are not necessarily great at the science of how
  adults learn. Often they spew a plethora of information. They “tell” instead
  of “engage”. Their listeners end up drowning in the information or turning
  away. It’s like asking people to take a sip of water from a fire hose.


  They often flood the audience with ideas, facts and evidence; known as “the
  data dump”. Dr. Scott offers three ideas to prevent this including:


  1.  **Learn how adults learn.** Connect new ideas with old ideas using
  metaphors or mnemonics.

  2.  **Learn how memory works.** Use small words and short sentences. Chunk the
  information. Create patterns. We listen to and remember no more than 3-5 ideas
  at a time (e.g. think about how phone numbers are chunked 800-555-1212).

  3.  **Learn how to get the audience to take action.**


  And above all, know that the need for emotional connection is key. As Dale
  Carnegie said, “_When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with
  creatures of logic, but creatures of emotion.”_ If you don’t engage your
  audience emotionally, you will fail to persuade.


  So how can a scientist work emotion into a message without sounding too fluffy
  or dramatic? Easy, Scott suggests. It can be as simple as word choice and
  pictures. If your audience can see or visualize the message then they can feel
  it. Three ways to help include:


  1.  Use word choice to promote connotation.

  2.  Use vivid language to tell a detailed story.

  3.  Use word choice to make the abstract something one can understand in the
  new context.


  For example, which statement from your doctor would engage you to want to
  learn more about altering your diet and lifestyle?


  1.  You need to think about altering your diet and lifestyle now in the early
  stages of your disease to prevent end organ damage.or

  2.  You need to think about altering your diet and lifestyle. Why? Think of
  your body like a house that is starting on fire. When a house begins to burn,
  you can save the contents and structure if you catch it while it is still
  smoking, but once that fire catches it can do a lot of damage to the house
  contents. If it remains unmanaged, of course it will bring the whole house
  down. Your body is now sending us smoke signals.

  It would be great if all we have to do to become masterful communicators and
  persuaders is read a book on it. But, even though Scott’s concepts are easy to
  understand, she concludes by urging us to explore further, practice with
  support and continue to learn.

> "A new fight is brewing over what might currently be the scarcest resource: our attention. We are now in an ‘attention economy’." _\- Getting a Squirrel to Focus, page 52_

Dr. Patricia Scott reminds us that no matter how brilliant we are, if we can’t get our message across, we won’t lead, sell, educate, persuade, advocate or help. In _Getting a Squirrel to Focus,_ she provides an easy and practical way to make our messages much more efficient and effective.

Masterful communicators may appear to have commonsensical and conversational exchanges. Dr. Scott shows us that these successful conversations are actually the result of a strategic approach to crafting and delivering persuasive messages. She lays out her ideas is a fun rubric she calls the ACORN Communication Strategy.

As a student and teacher of influence and persuasion in healthcare, I couldn’t agree more. The more I learn, the more I realize I need to learn! We are never done. Dr. Scott however, offers us a few gems to push us forward. Now it’s time to go out there and, as Dr. Scott says, “go nuts!”
