  ### Shake Your Money Maker


  > "Your goal is to eliminate as much, if not all, of the risk in the
  transaction for your client. When you take away the risk, you lower the
  barrier to action and eliminate the primary obstacle to buying."- Getting
  Everything You Can Out of All You’ve Got, page 21


  The whole book is based on Jay’s concept that there are only three ways to
  increase revenues in your business. We can (1) increase the number of clients
  we service, (2) increase the average dollar size of the sale per client, and
  (3) increase the number of times (frequency) clients return to make a
  purchase.


  Have you thought about ways you could increase these three fundamental factors
  to drive the growth of your business? Jay goes on to outline the “geometric
  growth formula”.


  This formula simply stated says: Our number of clients X (times) the
  transaction value per client X (times) the total number of transactions per
  year yields (equals) our total income. This is nothing more than the three
  fundamental factors listed above and outlined in an easy to implement formula.
  A small increase in any of these three factors produces a geometric increase
  in the total. How could you go about increasing just one of these factors in
  some small way? What if you could increase each of these factors in some small
  way? How would that impact your total income?


  Jay makes what I think is a very important distinction between the words
  **customer** and **client**. A customer is a person who purchases a commodity
  or service. A client, on the other hand, is a person who is under the
  protection of another. That must be why your tax lawyer calls you a client and
  not a customer. I don’t know about you, but the last thing I want is a tax
  lawyer that views my business as a commodity. I prefer protection! How do you
  view those who purchase your products, solutions, or services? Do your
  purchasers and probable purchasers view you as a commodity or protector?
  Marketing is really about communicating the message that you serve **clients**
  and not **customers**. Think of your clients as dear, valued friends.

  ### Multiply Your Maxim


  > "Having a reachable goal is more important to your success and financial
  prosperity than almost anything else you do."- Getting Everything You Can Out
  of All You’ve Got, page 337


  Whatever our industry, we are in the prospect and client generating business.
  The basic goal of all marketing is to gain, retain, and grow our client base.
  Jay recommends developing “host-beneficiary relationships designed to create
  win/win profitability opportunities.” In essence, our partners profit from our
  marketing and we profit from theirs. Who could you approach about setting up
  this type of business relationship? This is a piggy-back coat-tails principle
  very similar to that used by charge card companies. In this example (one of
  many, and we are only limited by our mind-set), a charge card company has
  complimentary offers sent with their monthly statement. The Charge Card
  company gets to offer specials to their audience, the advertisers get
  inexpensive advertising to a whole new audience. As another example, a
  landscaper could partner with a lawn pest-control company in a similar
  fashion.


  Jay goes on to describe the birth and implementation of a referrals program.
  He focuses on building consistency into that program and experimenting with
  incentives to promote referrals from your existing client base. He further
  outlines how a solid referral program can off-set the natural business
  attrition cycle. Thus, you can substantially grow your business in spite of
  attrition. An even better formula is growing your business through referrals
  while dramatically reducing attrition through a systematic process. How could
  you implement a systematic program to generate and grow your referrals while
  simultaneously reducing the attrition of current clients?

  ### Maximize What You Have


  > "You can’t maximize your performance or make the most money unless you know
  how to make the best use of your time, opportunities, efforts, and
  investments… The odds are good that you are currently underperforming and not
  reaching your real potential because you’re depending on the wrong actions or
  approaches for your success."- Getting Everything You Can Out of All You’ve
  Got, page 145


  Jay wants us to understand that our personal success and prosperity is tied to
  our ability to create our own breakthroughs. He wants us to work smarter – to
  skip levels and make quantum leaps. He provides a very important example from
  his own experience. We need to borrow ideas, processes, thoughts, and
  technology from other industries. Take the study of what works from a totally
  unrelated industry and re-formulate those success principles for
  implementation in your business (or industry).


  These breakthroughs can only come about with the proper mind-set. You have to
  be open to your environment and everything it offers. Look at old things with
  a fresh perspective. Discover hidden opportunities in every situation. Try and
  uncover a cash windfall every three months (see “Shake Your Money Maker”
  above). Work at engineering maximum success into every decision you make.
  Develop multiple streams of idea generation (think outside your current
  business and industry). Make the things around you special and unique – this
  includes your business, home, mode of transport, etc. Create more value for
  your employees, clients, and stakeholders.


  Jay suggests you keep a breakthrough list of ideas for implementation. In
  [_The Personal MBA_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-personal-mba/),
  Josh Kaufman spoke of a personal R & D program; a process that ties in nicely
  with this concept. You could use Josh’s program for personal development to
  help generate ideas for your “Breakthroughs” list. How many breakthrough ideas
  could you generate in a 30 minute brainstorming session? Would a mind-map be a
  good tool to help with this process?
f_conclusion: >-
  As much as things change—and marketing has definitely changed—the fundamentals
  remain the same. We do ourselves an injustice by getting caught up in the
  noise at the expense of those essentials. Jay Abraham’s _Getting Everything
  You Can Out of All You’ve Got_ will put you back in touch with what marketing
  is really all about – generating and keeping profitable business by
  implementing an ethical and consistent program. If you are looking to rekindle
  and retool your marketing basics and possibly add some new ideas to the mix, I
  highly recommend you get a copy and start studying today. Tomorrow, everything
  may change again, but the fundamentals will always remain relevant.

I have always been intrigued, and a little baffled, by the concept of marketing. Marketing has changed a lot since Jay Abraham first published _Getting Everything You Can Out of All You’ve Got_ in 2000. Or has it? Has marketing changed or has the playing field been leveled? Perusing the index of this book is a real eye-opener. My first thought was, “Wow! this guy really covers a lot of ground in 357 pages” – but marketing covers a lot of ground. Therein lies my intrigue. As a marketer, how would you know where to start? I think when you talk marketing today, most people think of Google Adwords or Adsense, Twitter, Facebook and yada yada social media this and that. Those are all important tools for sure, but they are not the only tools.

If the year 2000 is “old school”, then Jay Abraham’s _Getting Everything You Can Out of All You’ve Got_ is old school. I think in many respects though, Abraham’s book is even more relevant today than it was back in 2000. Jay brings us back to the fundamentals of marketing and why it’s important to the growth and prosperity of our businesses. In just 350+ pages of reading we can cut through all the noise that has clouded our thoughts about marketing, and the direction marketing had gone, and get back in touch with what marketing is really all about.

Think of your clients as dear, valued friends.
