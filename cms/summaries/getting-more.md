  ### Define your goals


  > "But until you define your goals and the people involved in a particular
  situation, you can’t effectively decide what negotiation tools to use. The
  people involved in a negotiation, and the process they use, comprise more than
  90 percent of what is important in a negotiation."- Getting More, page 22


  The quote above reflects one of the most critical components of going into any
  conversation, negotiation, or meeting. I recently researched and gave a
  presentation on some of the top performers in my organization and found the
  above quote to be one of the outlying characteristics from those most
  successful in negotiations and conversations than those who were not. Prior to
  any customer call, negotiation, or finalizing of price, all of the top
  performers that I interviewed had a goal for that conversation, and some wrote
  it out on a notepad in front of them. These top performers said it allowed
  them to direct their focus to ensure they got something out of the
  conversation that would move them forward in the deal. So before jumping ahead
  in the book to learn the tools and strategies this step should be ingrained
  first. Remember, what are your goals?

  ### Attitude


  > "If you come to a negotiation with a confrontational attitude, you will get
  less: in fact, 75 percent less over the long-term."- Getting More, page 353


  Attitude is emphasized throughout the whole book and I thought it a good fit
  as insight #2 because as the quote above illustrates, it really does affect
  your results. Whether you are nervous, upset, or angry, all of these emotions
  have been proven to decrease your chances of getting what you want. If you
  have ever been in a sales role before, I am sure at one time or another you
  may have experienced a similar phenomenon: You have a high sales target you
  have set to yourself that you will be held accountable for by management. The
  end of the month is coming and you don’t see where the rest of the business is
  going to come from so you frantically try to increase your activity (calls,
  emails, etc.), except the more you do in this frantic matter the less seems to
  come through. It’s almost as if the prospect can a sense your nerves or the
  desperation in your voice and it turns them away.


  When this happens Stuart suggests a good question to ask yourself: “Think
  about the worst thing that could happen to you in a negotiation. If you can
  withstand it you will be more confident.”


  The same goes for any conversation. This will help you rationalize your fear
  or worry and allow you to perform at your best, allowing you to have the best
  chance at reaching your target.

  ### Employ empathy over emotions


  > "Emotional payments have the effect of calming people down. They get people
  to listen and be ready to think more about their own welfare."- Getting More,
  page 135


  The danger of being emotional in a negotiation is that it causes you take your
  mind off your goals which we identified earlier as being a central tenet to
  success in the negotiation process. We have all heard when you are emotional
  you can’t be rational. This is a problem because you are apt to do things
  which are not in your best interest. Stuart mentions a study where one subject
  was given $10 to divide with another person where the other person had to
  agree to the split. If the other person rejected the offer, both parties would
  get nothing.


  Result: When the other person was offered $1 (meaning the offerer would get
  $9) 75% of the other people reject the offer. While this seems unfair, the
  fact of the matter is it is better to go home with $1 than with nothing. But
  the unfairness of someone else getting most of the amount available caused
  them to act emotionally, and against their goals and interests.


  Empathy is one emotion that does work in negotiations. Stuart shows us when a
  customer threatened a business owner to switch vendors because of a price
  increase (even though the price was less than those of other vendors). Don’t
  say “Sorry, there is nothing I can do” or allow the customer go to his
  competitors (which would have served neither—the customer would still end up
  paying more and the business would lose a customer). Instead, the business
  owner chose to use empathy by asking the customer how his company could add
  more value in exchange for a price increase, which resulted in the business
  owner retaining the customer.

  There are many tools and examples of how and when to use them in Stuart’s
  book; this summary does not even come close to covering all of them. What it
  does do is give you the keys to utilize everything within the 300+ pages so
  you are able to extract everything that is important to help you be more
  successful in whatever you choose to use the tools for. Reading without
  application will not make you better; those who begin using these strategies
  in everyday life will experience dramatic improvements in their lives, as
  witnessed by the countless examples and testimonials that are contained within
  the book. Here’s to _Getting More_ from your life!

  "First, done right, there is no difference between ‘negotiation,’
  “persuasion,’ ‘communication,’ or ‘selling.’ They all should have the same
  process. That is, they should start with goals, focus on people, and be
  situational."
