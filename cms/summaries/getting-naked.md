  ### Get Naked


  > "Without the willingness to be vulnerable, we will not build deep and
  lasting relationships in life."- Getting Naked, page vii


  Vulnerability. Removing the armour of infallibility, and getting real.
  _Getting Naked_ is a book about the very real value of breaking down the walls
  so many of us put up when interacting with our customers and, instead,
  connecting with them on a human level. It’s a book about being comfortable
  being wrong. About worrying about the customer first, and our own ego second.


  Lencioni explains that there are three fears that hold us back from being
  vulnerable (aka “naked”) in front of our customers:


  **Fear #1:** Fear of losing the business  

  **Fear #2:** Fear of being embarrassed  

  **Fear #3:** Fear of feeling inferior


  While all understandable, living within these three fears all be ensures that
  your relationships with your customers will never transcend a basic
  transaction. Through the process of overcoming these three fears, we elevate
  ourselves above the “transactional relationship” with our customer, and into
  the vaulted air of “trusted advisor”. Whether your “customer” is an outside
  client or your boss, if you’re working, then someone is paying you for your
  time and overcoming these three fears can dramatically improve your
  professional life. The following two Insights are but a taste of all the
  practical solutions found in _Getting Naked_.

  ### Tell the Kind Truth


  > "It's not that they go out of their way to tick off their clients. It's just
  that they're so focused on saying and doing whatever is in the best interests
  of those clients that they stop worrying about the repercussions."- Getting
  Naked, page 154


  Point blank question: Are you a yes-man, or do you tell the honest truth?
  Think it through, honestly. If your client, (or boss) comes to you looking for
  validation on something, do you give it to them unconditionally, or do you
  tell them what you really think? Lencioni calls the latter, “telling the kind
  truth”, and it can be an invaluable service that you provide to the
  “customers” in your life.


  I have one client who has great self confidence. He’s a talented
  sales-rep-turned-manager and he has a lot to offer to his team. He’s also
  incredibly strong in his opinions. (So much so that they can sometimes be
  conveyed as fact). And that can be a little intimidating for people on his
  team. I would wager that he hears “yes”, a lot more often than he hears true
  opinion. The irony is that he is actually quite interested in the opinions and
  pushback of his staff. He just doesn’t present himself that way.


  We certainly don’t want to be mean or disparaging in our “truth telling”, but
  we can provide so much more value if we are willing to extend ourselves a
  little beyond our comfort zone. Similar to the idea of “entering the danger”,
  we need to give our honest opinion and feedback when asked for it. The
  recipient will respect you for it.

  ### Enter the Dragon


  > "Starting with the CEO, they went around the room and told him what they
  thought his most valuable attribute was for the team, and then they went
  around and told him the one thing they thought he should work on."- Getting
  Naked, page 94


  There’s an expression in the improvisational acting world (improv) known as
  “Enter the Danger”. In improv situations, sometimes a player will do or say
  something bizarre; something totally at odds with the rest of the situation.
  As one of the other players in the scene, you have a choice to either embrace
  the outburst and run with it (entering the danger), or to ignore it and steer
  the scene back to more familiar territory. You can imagine which option leads
  to richer scenes.


  As human beings, our tendency can be to try to gloss over things that make us
  uncomfortable. When experiencing unappreciated or unproductive behaviour in a
  staff meeting, for example, we may choose to ignore the “elephant in the
  room”, and discuss it quietly with a co-worker afterwards. Nothing could be
  more toxic. And yet, we experience situations like this every day.


  One strong tip to “Getting Naked” is to address these situations as they come
  up. To “enter the danger”, so to speak. To address the elephants. Yes, it’s
  scary. Yes, it stretches you, and may lead to an uncomfortable moment.
  Ultimately though, if you’re entering the danger with the intention of
  bettering the situation, the team around you will thank you for it. We all
  want to improve these things. We just need to be willing to get our hands
  dirty. (and, from personal experience, I will tell you there is an incredible
  exhilaration that comes from successfully entering the danger and making an
  improvement.)
f_conclusion: >-
  At the end of the day, being a good service provider is simply a matter of
  focus. Are you focused on the best interests of yourself, or of the customer?
  Being focused on the customer means making some difficult choices; choices
  that could in fact hurt you. The irony, of course, is that working in the best
  interest of the customer is _always_ the right decision and, more often than
  not, will reward you in ways you never would have experienced had you chosen
  the self preservation mode instead. Just like personal relationships, magical
  things happen when you open up to the people who are important to you, and act
  in their best interest first. _Getting Naked_ may be a business book, but I
  think it’s also a great reminder for **all** the relationships in our lives –
  professional and otherwise.

It used to be that, “he who held the knowledge held the power”. Google changed that. If you have an internet connection, you have access to limitless amounts of data – more “knowledge” than anyone could possibly need in a lifetime. What used to be scarce, and therefore valuable, is now available in abundance. The world-wide web democratized information. But there’s a new scarcity and, as Patrick Lencioni brilliantly outlines in _Getting Naked_, it’s one that, when harnessed, can be incredibly powerful and lucrative.

If you, or your company interacts with a customer base, you inherently know what we’ve been talking about for a while – that low prices and a quality product no longer guarantee success. Customers have more options than ever, and they’re using this leverage to look for something **_more_**. They want an experience. An interaction that goes beyond a simple transaction. **They want to build relationships with their brands.** We’re entering a world of professional intimacy that harkens back to the days of “Small Town USA”, days when the neighbourhood butcher knew not only what cut of beef a customer preferred, but the names of their kids as well. We built relationships with our vendors and customers because we inherently knew that people do business with people they like. People they trust. People they know.

In _Getting Naked_, Lencioni teaches how to exemplify the one core trait that builds professional relationships faster than any other.
