  ### Writing your Personal Brand Statement


  > "You’re not defined by your job title or day-to-day responsibilities. You’re
  a brand as much as Coke, Nike, or Cover Girl. Ask yourself the same question
  that brand managers of companies ask themselves: How is my product or service
  different?"- Getting to Like, page 34


  As obvious as it may seem, the first step to developing and promoting your
  personal brand is to understand what your personal brand actually is.


  In order to position yourself as exceptional or distinct, it is crucial to
  understand your unique traits and abilities, and how these factors can be
  utilised in a professional setting.


  Goldman and Zagat suggest that writing a Personal Brand Statement allows you
  to create a general framework for how you define yourself, including your
  personality, your accomplishments, your flaws and how you interact with
  others.


  To start creating your Personal Brand Statement, ask yourself the following
  questions:


  *   What do I do that adds remarkable, measurable and distinctive value?

  *   What have I done as recently as this week to make myself distinct?

  *   What have I accomplished that I can be unabashedly proud of?

  *   What would my colleagues and customers say is my greatest strength?

  *   What is my most noteworthy personal trait?

  *   Ultimately, what do I want to be known for?


  Once you’ve written down your answers, condense your response into 15 words or
  less. This statement should be attention grabbing and intriguing to your
  prospective audience, and may take time to develop and refine. This will be
  your Personal Branding Statement, and will help you to stay focused as your
  career moves forward.

  ### Revising your Brand and Yourself


  > "Maybe you tried to market yourself as one thing and it didn’t work out. Or
  you might be a retiree reentering the workforce, or trying to add new skills
  to stay relevant. Now, who or what are you? How do you want to reinvent
  yourself?"- Getting to Like, page 180-181


  Whether you’re changing positions at your current workplace, starting your own
  business, or looking for a new job, people change and with that, careers
  change.


  As your career progresses through time, you may reach various points where
  aspects of your personal brand are no longer relevant to you, or you may want
  to reinvent your brand completely.


  While transitioning a personal brand can come with many challenges, Goldman
  and Zagat highlight a range of ways you can revise your brand over time,
  including:


  *   Taking a class

  *   Volunteering

  *   Joining a board

  *   Job shadowing

  *   Going on sabbatical


  These activities can help shift your focus, and can help you examine other
  areas that you may be interested in or skilled at. These new discoveries can
  help you add a new spin to your current brand or even identify a new direction
  for your career.

  ### The Risks of Being Inauthentic


  > "Personal brands are a constructed entity, but that’s okay. It doesn’t mean
  they’re fake. You can highlight certain parts of your personality or character
  in order to present a solid image; that doesn’t make them less true."- Getting
  to Like, page 147


  When many people think about creating a personal brand, they often view it as
  inventing a whole new persona, and as a result they may view branding as being
  deceitful and inauthentic.


  Personal branding is about creating a condensed version of your personality,
  interests and core values, or as Goldman and Zagat call it “You-Concentrate”.


  Your brand is your reputation, and your reputation forms the foundation for
  your entire career. Creating a personal brand that doesn’t align with who you
  really are is a recipe for disaster. You audience will notice the
  inconsistencies between you and your brand, they will feel misled and you will
  lose credibility, which may damage your brand permanently.


  Deception may seem advantageous in the short-term, especially if you lack the
  skills or abilities to achieve your career goals, however as time passes it
  will become more difficult to keep up with the contradictions between yourself
  and your brand.


  So if you run a vegan cooking blog but enjoy going hunting on the weekends, or
  run a travel agency but you’ve never left your hometown, expect your audience
  to notice that you don’t practice what you preach.
