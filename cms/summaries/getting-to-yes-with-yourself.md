  ### Six Steps


  > "As I have personally experienced, getting to yes with yourself is not just
  the most challenging, but the most rewarding negotiation of all."- Getting to
  Yes with Yourself, page 11


  When you look in the mirror in the morning, you are seeing the person who is
  likely to give you the most trouble that day. As President Theodore Roosevelt
  said, “If you could kick the person in the pants responsible for most of your
  trouble, you wouldn’t sit for a month.”


  We are reaction machines. We judge ourselves, blame others, fear scarcity and
  reject when we feel rejected. We sabotage ourselves by reacting in ways that
  do not serve our true interests. We lose our temper, call someone a liar or
  lash out, mostly because we have an underlying win-lose mindset. We assume
  that either we can get what we want OR they get what they want—but not both.
  This comes from a scarcity mindset.


  Step back and think: What if you focused on both sides winning. When we switch
  to a mindset of abundance, of satisfying the needs of yourself and of others,
  that’s when we become our own best allies. The process of turning ourselves
  from opponents into allies is what Ury refers to as getting to yes with
  yourself.


  Ury spent many years studying what blocks us from satisfying our needs and the
  needs of others and has codified what he’s learned into a method with six
  steps. Each step addresses a specific internal challenge.


  These six steps may seem like common sense but Ury warns us that they are
  uncommonly applied! By reviewing them you can prepare yourself for any
  challenge the day may bring.


  1.  **Put yourself in YOUR shoes**. Instead of continually judging yourself,
  listen empathetically for underlying needs.

  2.  **Develop your inner BATNA.** Instead of blaming others with whom we are
  in conflict, take responsibility. Figure out your **b**est **a**lternative
  **t**o **n**egotiated **a**greement (BATNA) to end up from the negotiation in
  a place where your needs are met.

  3.  **Reframe your picture.** Instead of succumbing to the fear of scarcity
  that exists in almost everyone, change how you see life. Choose to see life as
  on your side.

  4.  **Stay in the zone.** Instead of being lost in resentment for the past and
  anxiety about the future, be in the present. This is the only place where you
  have the power to experience true satisfaction and opportunity for
  improvement.

  5.  **Respect them even if.** Resist the temptation to meet rejection with
  rejection, attack with attack and exclusion with exclusion. Instead, surprise
  others with respect and inclusion even when they are difficult.

  6.  **Give and receive.** Don’t fall into the win-lose trap even when
  resources seem scarce. Instead give first.


  Let’s explore just two of the steps further.

  ### Give and Receive


  > "Paradoxically, it is by giving that we often receive what we most want."-
  Getting to Yes with Yourself, page 155


  Ury shares a story of Scott, a twenty-eight year old picture-perfect success
  story. He earned lots of money, wore a Rolex watch, drove a BMW, had a model
  girlfriend. Then it suddenly hit him. He was emotionally, spiritually and
  morally bankrupt. He looked around and realized no one in his life was happy.


  After much soul searching he came to the truth that “no matter how much we may
  get, there is never enough.” He anticipated there would never be enough girls,
  money or status to achieve the elusive happiness he sought. His neediness was
  insatiable when he only thought about himself and what he could get.


  In contrast, he realized that genuine _giving_ could meet his deepest need to
  be useful and connected to others and to make a difference in the world. His
  big ah-ha was the paradox truth that it is by giving that we often receive
  what we most want.


  When we connect with our purpose (or what difference we make in the world),
  giving can become engrained in the fabric of our lives. And like a muscle, the
  giving attitude strengthens with exercise.


  I have seen first-hand the power of purpose (in fact I teach a workshop by
  that very title). When the pharma people I work with get in touch with,
  articulate and communicate their purpose to help improve patient outcomes,
  that’s when they do their best work and are the happiest. It’s incredible.

  ### Respect Them Even If


  > "I’ve long noticed that the cheapest concession you can make, the one that
  costs you the least and yields the most, is to give respect."- Getting to Yes
  with Yourself, page 117


  I had the opportunity to practice #5 yesterday. Six days before my flight to a
  speaking gig, my client called to cancel. It had nothing to do with me but
  rather internal issues. Her solution was to simply rebook it to a new date.
  She bemoaned the fact that she had no more budget to compensate me for the
  cancellation. The trouble of course was that I had three days reserved for her
  and, on top of that, I had turned down another opportunity to speak with a
  significantly bigger audience (and budget).


  I was upset and frustrated, but in the heat of the moment I took a deep breath
  and reacted with respect and inclusion. I said _“I completely trust you and
  just know that we will figure out something that works for us both. Let’s
  sleep on it and chat again tomorrow.”_ The next day I proposed that I spend
  those three days working on another project for them. That way the money
  invested wouldn’t be going down the drain as a cancellation fee and my days
  would not be wasted—a win-win!


  What situation do you have in front of you in which you need to respect them
  even if…? What if you assume the best and show them you believe in them?
f_conclusion: >-
  If you review and practice the six steps daily, you will be ready for your
  toughest situation or negotiation. Every single day you will have
  opportunities to change your stance from win-lose to win-win; to embrace a
  mindset of abundance.

Do you ever wonder how you can get what you want while satisfying the needs and concerns of others in your life at home and at work?

For the past 35 years, William Ury has served as a negotiation adviser and mediator in conflicts ranging from boardroom battles to coal mine strikes to wars in the Middle East. He has taught negotiation strategies to tens of thousands of leaders in business, government and civil society around the world.

Building on his work in [_Getting to Yes_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/getting-to-yes/), he adds one essential component in his latest book, _Getting to Yes with Yourself_. The premise of that component is that the better you are at “getting to yes with yourself,” the better you will be at getting to yes with others.

Ury proposes that there is perhaps no factor that has greater impact on our relationships and negotiations than our underlying attitude toward ourselves, life and others.
