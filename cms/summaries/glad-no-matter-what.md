  ### Practical Gladness


  > "This is not a book about feeling glad when you don’t. How annoying! This is
  a book about finding and living from the glad parts in all your feelings."-
  Glad No Matter What, page 4


  “Practical gladness” for SARK is about recognizing that we can be sad/glad/mad
  and more all at once. Many people don’t even know this is possible. That’s
  because most of us were not taught how to hold or navigate multiple feelings.


  As we learn to occupy our sadness and other feelings in new ways, we can
  shorten the length of time we “need” to experience them. Yes, we will still
  feel the challenging aspects. The difference is that we won’t spend as much
  time and energy there as we practice the muscles of perspective-shifting,
  willingness, flexibility and truth-telling.

  ### Telling and Living New Stories


  > "Don’t ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come
  alive and then go do that. Because, what the world needs is people who have
  come alive."- Dr. Howard Thurman, quoted in Glad No Matter What, page 37


  Grief, loss and change (naturally) can result in our living in old stories
  that we then repeat to understand the pain. The issue is, we sometimes get
  trapped there – like ruts in a road. Each time we re-tell the old story, those
  feelings are reawakened. We then tend to conclude that we’re still “there”. To
  clear the way for new stories, here are some techniques:


  *   If there are lingering stories you tell with yourself as a victim, take
  them apart until you can express the narrative in a completely neutral way
  with no “charge” against something or someone else.

  *   Suffering comes from comparing how it was to how it is now. To break free
  from the “polarized spell” where everything is extreme, either/or, good/bad,
  idealized or demonized, do understand that there is a middle ground. It
  consists of a much wider, more forgiving perspective. Practice with living in
  this place.

  *   Be on the lookout for words that signify extremes – never, always, worst
  and best. For example, when we make others into monsters because they did
  something “wrong” to us, we freeze them there. That merely keeps the pain
  intact.

  *   The opposite of loss is not gain…it is found. Dreams do not get “lost”.
  They will wait and are very resilient. Every experience we go through is
  useful. Nothing is ever lost, wasted or broken in the process of living our
  lives.

  *   In your own way, you are a transformational change agent. Tell those
  stories!

  ### Yes to All the Changes

  something good or better!"- Glad No Matter What, page 21


  That said, we first need to realize it’s as important to embrace the “not
  glad” places as it is to be glad. Society puts a lot of positive attention on
  feeling good, happy, centered and joyful. The thing is, these great feelings
  don’t and cannot last. When we repress, deny, avoid and conjure stories to
  cover up uncomfortable feelings, they have no “choice” but to grow louder
  through unhappiness, hopelessness, crabbiness and negative self-talk.


  Instead, we need to accept that we’ll all encounter highs and lows. Finding
  gifts in every situation does not mean disregarding pain, sorrow or suffering.
  To get more accustomed to ranges of feelings, here are several re-framing
  ideas:


  *   Even 1-5 seconds of acknowledging a “not glad” feeling will shift this
  energy.

  *   Start noticing and speaking your feelings differently. Imagine a good
  friend changing a plan. Rather than getting stuck in anger or frustration,
  your response is: “Of course I understand! I feel disappointed that I won’t
  see you, but I also feel glad to have some extra time for myself.”

  *   For those who like writing, try “3-Part Harmony”. Part 1 is Mad Pages,
  where you record current challenging feelings. Part 2 is Wise Pages, where
  your kind inner voice replies with reassuring, comforting and supportive
  comments to everything you’ve written. In Part 3, the Glad Pages, you list
  everything you’re grateful for (including things in the process of
  transforming). This is also an exercise in weaving together multiple feelings
  simultaneously.

  *   Did you know most growth takes place in darkness? As the “pieces” of our
  lives fall apart, new ones materialize and old ones can then be discarded or
  reshaped.

  Especially with the latter call to action in mind, it’s no wonder speaker and
  author, Cheri Huber, states in her testimonial for this inspiring work: “_SARK
  is one of the truly authentic voices in the world of personal transformation.
  There are no theories here. This book will take you on a journey straight to
  the heart, holding your hand every step of the way, and you will know you can
  relax completely in the care of a compassionate and wise guide. The whole
  world ought to read this book.”_ Well said!
