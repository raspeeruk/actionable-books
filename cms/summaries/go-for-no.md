  ### The Virtues of Failing


  > "Failure is the halfway mark on the way to success."- Go for No, page 29


  How many sales have I happily made (ideas to my boss/staff/co-workers and
  products/services to customers) thinking that I got exactly what I wanted, a
  **Yes**? Now I wonder, was I thinking too small in my ask? Had I gotten some
  **No**’s (_4 of them_) on the way to **Yes** I’d know for sure I’d done my
  best.

  ### Next – The Magic Word


  > "Failure Quotient – how many times is a person willing to fail before
  succeeding?"- Go for No, page 50


  As I was reading I was thinking – what could make me want to implement this
  concept? What makes people be able to overcome decades of not wanting to hear
  no, to now embracing it? And then I realized that the people the authors use
  as examples have something in common (Colonel Sanders, Babe Ruth, Allen Breed
  – who? R_ead the book and you’ll see_), they have _passion_ for what they’re
  doing. If you don’t have passion, _Go for No_ will be harder to implement
  because your only reward will be hitting your No goals – likely not enough to
  make it worth it to fail and fail and fail and fail (_that was 4 times!)._

  ### Fail Eagerly


  > "Set goals for the number of No’s you’re going to get each week."- Go for
  No, page 46


  Being innately competitive as a species, we have a natural desire to reach any
  goals we set for ourselves (or are set for us). Setting **failure goals** is a
  way to be excited about failing/hearing the word No. Thomas Edison said, “I
  have not failed 10,000 times. I have successfully found 10,000 ways that will
  not work.” So go out and try, even if you may hear the word No!


  And crucially important for managers/companies – to help staff succeed, we
  need to reward failure – recognize it as an essential part of getting to yes –
  or no matter what, people will still work for Yes and therefore avoid No. We
  work for what we get rewarded for!
f_conclusion: >-
  When I first started reading _Go for No_, the storyline felt a little hokey.
  But seriously, stick with it. It’s a short book so it’s only a few pages
  before you get to the concept of _Go for No_ – a concept that is so clearly
  what you need to be doing that you’ll forget that it was a hard start.

  "What did the customer say no to? – nothing? – then how did you know he was
  done (had bought all he was going to)?"

The storyline of Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz’s _Go for No_ is genius. It’s something we all wish was possible: get a glimpse now of what will happen in our future. We learn all of the concepts of _Going for No_ by hearing “successful Eric” talking to “not-so-successful Eric” of 10 years ago. Despite the fact that Eric is a salesperson, the concepts from _Go for No_ are universally applicable. Since the risk of rejection is what stops most of us from trying things, we all need to learn to reframe the word “No”.

I really loved the reminders from the book about the jobs where failing is a common occurrence – baseball players getting back up to bat, doctors serving the next patient after one died, an entrepreneur starting a restaurant, inventors. There are also examples of people in jobs who kept going after failures – Abraham Lincoln, Babe Ruth, Colonel Sanders, Thomas Edison, to name a few. In all these cases, it’s often the successes we focus on and remember, sometimes forgetting about the “failures” all together. It’s so important that we are reminded that the failures are a part of the path to success.

The steps for implementing the concepts of _Go for No_ are so succinct that after reading the book’s seventy-four, large print, lots-of-white space pages, I find I don’t even have to look at my notes to rewrite them:

*   Most people are looking for a Yes, so they stop when they get one and limit their success by taking themselves out of the game (set daily or weekly goals for how many No’s you’ll get, not how many Yes’s).
*   When looking for people who’ll say Yes you need to fail faster so you can get on to the next person who may be the Yes (start by asking for the sale so you can move on to the next person if they say No).
*   No just means not yet (people say No 4 times before they say Yes so keep track of the number of No’s per person and plan to go back).
*   Next after hearing No, a failure, go onto the next person. (Of course think about and learn from what happened, but go on to the next person quickly.)
*   You need to _want_ to fail, not just be willing to (believing this will make you keep trying to fail and eventually you’ll not fear it/dislike it as you see that it will get you to more successes).

The authors and the reviewers promised a book with a concept that will change your life and if you apply it, it will! Heard that before and found yourself not applying? The couple of things the author says to do to apply _Go for No_ are so succinct that it’s easy to get started failing!

“Yes is the destination – No is how you get there.”
