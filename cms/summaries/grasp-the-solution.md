  ### Think About Your Thinking


  > "The killer ideas and solutions that drive your business forward don't just
  simply fall from the sky. They come from using the power of your mind - your
  thinking."- GRASP The Solution, page 36


  It seems that we have no problem thinking about various aspects of our life to
  make them better—we think about our diet, we think about our fitness, we think
  about our appearance—but how often do we think about our thinking? Griffiths
  says that if you take just one thing away from his book, it would be to think
  about the strategies you employ for your thinking.


  Our minds are at the core of everything we do, all our reasoning, problem
  solving, planning, motivating, communicating, and actions. It’s the starting
  point for every possible pursuit or task. So the more effectively we utilize
  and strengthen our minds by increasing our thinking skill, the more successful
  we’ll be in everything we do. In other words, it’s all mental.


  And Griffiths lays out principles and a system for training your mind to
  generate solutions to any problem or need. Innovation blooms from the soil of
  your mind.

  ### Daydream Productively


  > "The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap
  in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes
  to you and you don't know how or why."- Albert Einstein, quoted in GRASP The
  Solution, page 191


  It’s disappointing that daydreaming has a bad rap. Only the lazy,
  undisciplined or spacey kid daydreams, apparently. Well, if Einstein was lazy
  or undisciplined then we have a lot to learn. Daydreaming holds tremendous
  power and can be an excellent way to encourage creative visualization and
  insight. Many inventors and scientists have credited daydreaming for their
  moments of brilliance. In fact, Albert Einstein referred to his daydreaming
  episodes as ‘thought experiments’. The theory of relativity was discovered
  during one of these episodes.


  The key to productive daydreaming is to make sure that you are relaxed and not
  trying too hard. Yet, it still needs to be purposeful and deliberate. We need
  to put in the preparation and study for our mind to be able to ‘incubate
  ideas.’ We also need to notice when we stumble upon a new idea and make sure
  we capture it.


  Griffiths proposes a simple two-step approach to focused daydreaming.


  1.  **Preparation** – collect and sort all relevant information in relation to
  your problem and explore possible solutions (using the techniques described
  throughout the book.)

  2.  **Let your Mind Wander** – switch off your attention and let the problem
  and all the information germinate in your mind for a while. Use simple tasks
  to redirect your focus, such as having a bath or shower, walking in a park,
  riding on a train or plane, or lying awake in the morning or night.


  Overall, practice ‘mindfulness’, the art of paying careful attention to the
  details of the present moment, without judgment. Notice things and write them
  down. You’ll find new ideas in your pile of observations.

  ### Practice Purposeful Creativity


  > "Strategy is what makes creativity purposeful so we can promote
  unconventional and original thinking, but with practical relevance."- GRASP
  The Solution, page 53


  Creativity isn’t just an artsy ambiguous concept for those who make crafts or
  paintings. Creativity is foundation from which anything new is born, and
  therefore deserves our most serious treatment. Griffiths offers a solid
  functional process for applying a purposeful strategy to your creativity. He
  calls it ‘The Solution Finder’, and explains how it combines three operative
  thinking modes to create the most productive environment for your mind.


  The three modes are:


  1.  **Generative** – we generate a wide range of possible options.

  2.  **Analytical** – we analyze these options and gather information in order
  to converge to a single solution.

  3.  **Selective** – we strengthen and reinforce our chosen solution and decide
  how to take it forward.


  Two additional modes of thinking, **Reactive** and **Proactive**, are added to
  create a memorable acronym: **GRASP**. Each mode is described in detail and
  helps the reader conceptualize why their minds think in certain ways.


  With these modes as the foundation, a 4 step process is laid out to find your
  solution.


  1.  Define the problem using ‘Five Wives, One Husband, and a Map’ (a creative
  way to remember the technique.)

  2.  Generate ideas using the correct brainstorming strategy and multiple
  tactics for looking at the problem differently.

  3.  Evaluate ideas using convergent thinking.

  4.  Build your solution and convert it into reality by making plans and taking
  action.


  “When you provide structures, processes, and systematic techniques, you
  dramatically increase people’s potential to think creatively so that it
  becomes a regular, everyday prospect” (page 270).


  ‘Purposeful practice’ of creativity will help you develop the skill of
  creating new ideas, just like the practice of any skill is necessary to become
  proficient.
f_conclusion: >-
  Griffiths doesn’t claim that his content is earth shatteringly new; he mostly
  wanted to validate what is already known about thinking and problem solving in
  order to create a useful methodology that will help people make the best of
  it. He believes that the value of the book is that it will make it easier for
  you to apply this knowledge systematically in a world that’s becoming more
  complex and fast-paced.

If you could come up with that one killer idea, that one moment of brilliance, what would it be worth to you?

Probably a lot.

And that is why Chris Griffiths wrote _GRASP The Solution_; to give you the strategies that will help you use the most powerful tool you have for making big things happen—your mind.

Every great innovation began as an idea in someone’s mind. But even though there are a lot of minds in the world, not enough of them understand how they work or what strategy or process to use to get the most out of them.

Chris Griffiths shows us how the mind can approach an idea from different angles, using distinct categories of thinking. Once we understand those categories and know when to use them, we will have access to an invaluable process for creating solutions to our most perplexing problems.

And I would agree. Go _GRASP The Solution_ and use your creative mind to become an innovation leader.
