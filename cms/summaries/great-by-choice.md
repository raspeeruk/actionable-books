  ### The 10X Paradox


  > "10Xers reject the choice between consistency and change; they embrace
  consistency and change, both at the same time."- Great by Choice, page 144


  There’s a popular myth in our society that the most successful companies (and
  individuals, for that matter) reach the upper echelons of success by swinging
  for the fences. By innovating something radically new and different. By taking
  huge risks – putting it “all on the line.” While Collins and Hansen are
  willing to admit that such tactics can sometimes lead to one-off success, the
  great companies that **last** – through good times and bad – are not the ones
  that make the massive leaps and huge risks. Instead, they display a
  **consistence** balance of **Fanatic Discipline** (sticking to their core
  values and process through good times and bad), **Productive Paranoia**
  (constantly asking “what if?” and planning for the inevitable “bad luck” that
  we’re all subject to), **Empirical Creativity** (innovating through testing
  and direct observation), and **Level 5 Ambition** (aspiring to something
  greater than personal success).


  It’s the balance of these four factors – Discipline, Paranoia, Creativity, and
  Ambition – that makes a company **great**. And there are some simple ideas in
  _Great by Choice_ that you can apply to your own life and business, regardless
  of what you do or who you do it for.

  ### Bullets Before Cannonballs


  > "A bullet is a low-cost, low-risk, and low-distraction test or experiment."-
  Great by Choice, page 96


  One of my favorite analogies in _Great by Choice_ is that of “bullets and
  cannonballs.” Bullets, as Collins and Hansen define above, are “low-cost,
  low-risk, and low-distraction test\[s\] or experiment\[s\],” while cannonballs
  are the activities you put a ton of energy, time, and money into. The image
  Collins and Hansen use is that of two ships, engaging in battle. Fire one
  cannonball only to realize you’ve missed your target, and you may not have
  enough ammunition left over to fire another one. Fire several bullets,
  however, and you can learn the right trajectory before you use the majority of
  your gunpowder firing a cannonball.


  The 10Xers studied in the book were constantly probing: experimenting with new
  products, features, markets, or ventures. But they never fired a cannonball
  until they were fairly sure of its success. Collins and Hansen call these
  “calibrated cannonballs,” and they had a much higher probability of success
  than the “uncalibrated cannonballs” fired by the comparison companies.


  It may be exciting to put all your resources into a gamble, but it never leads
  to long term success. In fact, the “lucky hit of an uncalibrated cannonball
  can often breed a gambling mentality and ultimately sink the company.”


  **Be sure you’re firing enough _bullets_ to stay apprised to new
  opportunities, but don’t fire your _cannonballs_ until you’re fairly certain
  of the outcome.**

  ### Impose the 20 Mile March


  > "The 20 Mile March creates two types of self-imposed discomfort: (1) the
  discomfort of unwavering commitment to high performance in difficult
  conditions, and (2) the discomfort of holding back in good conditions."- Great
  by Choice, page 45


  In a modern day take on the “Tortoise and the Hair” fable, the “20 Mile March”
  was a consistent theme throughout all the 10Xers that Collins and Hansen
  studied. In its essence, a “20 Mile March” mentality means setting a benchmark
  for a certain period of time, and then hitting that benchmark. Consistently.
  While this may sound like basic advice, it includes two fundamental shifts in
  behaviour from what undisciplined people and companies might display.


  One, it means that regardless of whatever “bad luck,” extenuating
  circumstances, or delays we might experience, we **will** achieve that
  benchmark, come hell or high water. It’s a fanatical dedication to the bar,
  and doing everything humanly possible to hit it.


  Two, it also means not getting carried away with our successes. The “20 Mile
  March”-ers outlined in _Great by Choice_ not only had the tenacity to push
  through obstacles to achieve their benchmarks, but the self-discipline to hold
  back from jumping on new opportunities simply because they presented
  themselves.


  Perhaps most importantly, the 10X companies were extremely careful in defining
  their “20 Mile March”. The March had to be something that made sense for their
  industry, large enough to stretch them and encourage growth, but small enough
  that it was possible to achieve. The time frame had to be long enough to allow
  them to maintain control over hitting the target, but short enough to keep
  their focus.


  So the question, of course, is, **“What’s your 20 Mile March?”** For your
  business, your life and your objectives, what’s the benchmark that you can set
  that is both achievable **and** stretches you? And will you stay committed to
  it through good times and bad?
f_conclusion: >-
  I was a big fan of [_Good to Great_](../summaries/good-to-great/) and, if
  anything, Jim Collins’ writing has only gotten better with time. I think what
  I love most about his books is the empirical data interwoven with great
  stories of human accomplishment. For me, _Great By Choice_ was an uplifting
  reminder of the strength of human spirit and the rewards that come to those
  who are diligent, focused, curious, and passionate. Like Collins’ other books,
  _Great by Choice_ is as applicable for individuals as it is for corporations,
  truly transcending the world of Wall Street. After all, in Jim’s own words:
  _“Greatness is not just a business quest; it’s a human quest.”_

  "10X leaders can be bland or colorful, uncharismatic or magnetic, understated
  or flamboyant, normal to the point of dull, or just flat-out weird - none of
  this really matters, as long as they're passionately driven for a cause beyond
  themselves."

It takes him a while to write them, but man; are they good (scratch that – “great”) when they do finally hit the shelves. I’m talking about Jim Collins’ seemingly bi-decennial blockbuster business books, and his latest, _Great by Choice_ is no disappointment. Picking up where his last hits ([_Built to Last_](../summaries/built-to-last/), [_Good to Great_](../summaries/good-to-great/) and [_How the Mighty Fall_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/how-the-mighty-fall/)) left off, _Great by Choice_ examines the success (and failure) of great businesses in times of “uncertainty, chaos and luck.”

Utilizing the strengths of his dedicated, multi-body research team, Collins – along with his new co-author, Morten T. Hansen – compared 11 company sets over a thirty-year period to determine if there were certain behaviours that could be identified in highly successful companies. (There are, by the way.)

Collins and Hansen labelled these successful companies “10Xers,” meaning that over the 30 year study period, they outperformed the general market by a factor of at least 10. What the authors learned about the factors that led to this terrific accomplishment may surprise you.
