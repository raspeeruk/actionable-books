  ### Greatness is not given


  > "Greatness is not given; it is learned and earned"- Great CEOs and How They
  Are Made, page 11


  It is the ongoing leadership debate: nature versus nurture. The author does
  acknowledge that you do require some fundamental skills, knowledge and
  experience to be successful; however many of the key ingredients can be
  learned and developed. You learn and develop these imperatives by soliciting
  feedback from others who will help you see your blind spots.


  Also inherent in this comment is a sentiment of gratitude and generosity. Seth
  Godin in his blog talks about the generosity boomerang. Conventional wisdom
  would have us believe that success makes us happy, and this happiness is what
  permits us to be generous. Perhaps a more accurate and compelling thought is
  that generosity and gratitude make us happy, and happy people are more likely
  to be successful. While John Wilson does not come out and tell the reader to
  be grateful for the opportunity he or she has been given or to give their time
  generously to others, you feel it in his words, his definition of GREAT and in
  the words of people who have worked with him.

  ### Check my back swing


  > "To learn from an elite, private brain trust that stands for your success is
  powerful."- Great CEOs and How They Are Made, page 143


  We all have bosses and key stakeholders who provide direction, demand results
  and evaluate our success; however, this dynamic has an element of hierarchy
  and power distribution to it. John Wilson compels those who strive to be
  GREATto participate in a peer group or network outside the four walls of their
  business. This is a group of business leaders you can talk to who will give
  you honest, unbiased feedback. These are also individuals from whom you can
  learn and benefit from their success and challenges. This approach resonates
  with the trend we are seeing in Learning and Development of peer based
  programs. Learning from those who have walked in your shoes, faced your
  challenges, but in their own organizations.


  John is the founder of CEO Global Network, an organization that matches CEOs
  with peers groups that meet their needs. The testimonials in John’s book tell
  us this works in a formal, structured environment. I think this can also work
  in a less formal way as well. Seek out your own advisory board of competent,
  committed people you trust who will help hold you accountable to your goals,
  give you honest feedback on your course of action and support your success.

  W4C (Walk the four corners) is not a new concept, but John Wilson puts his
  actionable spin on it and integrates the practice into two of the key
  imperatives. Don’t just be visible. Take the time to stop walking and
  recognize the success of someone along your path in an individual, personal
  and authentic way. Recognize that you do not know the detailed actions that
  support the business as well as those who do the work. Take the time to stop
  walking and ask curious questions such as “What did you see that I didn’t?”


  Many people see the value of being visible, but John uses the tactic as a call
  to action and so can you.
f_conclusion: >-
  I loved the book. It was concise, practical, actionable, honest and authentic,
  but it leaves me with a question. Why should being GREAT only be a goal for
  CEOs? Why can’t more of us strive for this, develop our own private brain
  trusts to check our back swing and why can’t we spend 20 minutes a few days a
  week walking the halls of our offices or the plant floors, asking curious
  questions and listening to the insight of those who know those parts of the
  business best. Do you really need to be a CEO to want to have this impact and
  be willing to take action to achieve it?

> "This is not a tome for your living room bookshelf. This is a guide to be kept on your desk, dog-eared and highlighted" _\- Hugh MacKinnon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bennett Jones LLP, Great CEOs and How They Are Made, page v_

John Wilson is passionate about helping business leaders achieve success in their family, personal and professional lives. He does not profess to be a great writer, but rather a lifelong learner who is authentic, pragmatic and optimistic in delivering his perspective. The content of _Great CEOs and How They are Made_is focused around 7 critical imperatives. These imperatives are not just chapter headings. They are calls to action and even unavoidable obligations. This book reads like the greatest hits summary of key business books, assessment tools and actions.

Also included in the book are numerous references from business leaders who have adopted John Wilson’s approach and willingly and candidly share their journey.
