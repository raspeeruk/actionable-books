  ### We are Each Capable of Doing Great Work


  > "The role of a difference maker is available to everyone."- Great Work, page
  3


  **Every person is capable of doing great work.** Sturt defines great work as,
  “making a difference that people love.” But, most often, we do not. He has
  nothing against good work. Great work stands on the shoulders of good work.
  Doing good work is about taking something and making it better.


  We live in a world that defines most of us by our work. We can choose to do
  so-so, good, or great work. We can first make the move toward doing great work
  by refusing to hide behind the usual excuse that it’s not our problem.


  In order to make a difference that is valuable, important, doesn’t make more
  work, and is something that people love, difference-makers tap into two
  important aspects of their personalities. They:


  **Think (or see) differently:** They must think and see with their mind’s eye,
  from a new perspective, in different, sometimes unusual combinations.


  And,


  **Act differently:** They must choose to take action and wander into new and
  uncharted territory.


  Working on this book could not have come at a more opportune moment. I could
  clearly see what needed to happen in order to re-imagine our training process,
  turning it into something people love, while accomplishing the intended goals.
  Additionally, I could understand why no one else in the room would have come
  to the same conclusion.


  Every industry has new rules, regulations, guidelines and standards coming
  into play. If we fall behind, everyone will pay. So, a mental shift has to
  occur from, “It’s not my responsibility,” to “How can we make this better for
  everyone?” **How do we get from so-so, to good, to great work?**

  ### Act Differently


  > "... we cannot become the difference makers we were meant to be until we
  leave the comfort of base camp and 'get on the wall."- Great Work, page 163


  Through ongoing studies and social experiments, Sturt found that there are
  five skills that are available to everyone who chooses to make a difference.
  They are asking the right questions, seeing for yourself, talking to members
  outside of your immediate group, improving the process and of course, and
  delivering the goods. The way to make a difference is to activate these skills
  in your life.


  In addition to listening to our hunches, we need to pause to look at
  processes. Is it good, or just good enough? We step into this pause to ask why
  the status quo is the way it is, and why doesn’t someone do something about
  it.


  The questions aren’t grand. It’s usually a simple question nagging at your
  brainstem that you cannot let go of.


  Questions like:


  *   Why can’t Johnny read any better? (Ted Geisel, _Dr. Seuss_)

  *   What would happen if we changed the process?

  *   How come IT can’t help us with this?


  We all have hunches, intuitions, feelings about how something can be changed,
  but we have been taught to blow them off. And, we have a unique life
  perspective, filled with work experience, family, life experiences, hobbies,
  other interests and pursuits, that make our lens on the problem unique, as is
  the solution that comes to us.


  We can take the things we are good at and tease at the edges of the problem
  for some connection and come up with distinctive solutions. Crazy, but
  brilliant, doable solutions.


  One of my favorite stories involves Martin Cooper of Motorola. When tasked
  with making the next generation of car-phone, he asked the simple sounding
  question, “Why is it that when I want to call a person, I have to call a
  place?” This question turned a whole industry on its head.


  Wayne Gretsky. Everyone knows his famous quote, “Skate to where the puck is
  going, not where it has been.” But few people know the story behind it. As a
  child, he sat and watched games and plotted out the movements of the puck long
  before he became a hockey celeb.


  Or Eiji, thinking to put a “kingfisher beak” on the bullet trains in Osaki to
  get rid of the almost sonic boom caused every time the trains entered the
  tunnels. How? Because one of his outside interests was Ornithology.


  **Our work lives and our “real” lives do not have to be so
  compartmentalized.** We can all continue to do so-so work, waiting for someone
  else to chime in, but we each have it within us to do great work. We each have
  unique skill-sets and experiences.


  You’ve got some thorny issues floating around that everyone is putting up
  with; hoping they will disappear of their own accord. You have a few hunches
  about how to make a dent in the problem, if not resolve it. Now you have some
  help. In David Sturt’s book, you have a well-written resource, with actionable
  steps at the end of each chapter that will help you bring to light what you
  already have inside of you.


  **You have mad skills**. Step into the _terra incognito_. Set a goal to raise
  the bar on what is possible. You have great work to do.

  ### Think (or See) Differently


  > "If you look at how your work affects others, at how relationships work, at
  what others want and need, you will see things you don't see when you are just
  going through the motions."- Great Work, page 4


  Most people work in environments where their jobs are defined by a paper job
  description with specific limitations. We are being called to think on a
  grander scale, and do what Sturt refers to as job-crafting. Making a mental
  shift that we aren’t locked in predefined boxes and that things can change.
  Freedom to think that you can make bigger connections to a brighter future for
  everyone. One of the keys to great work is an unselfish ambition for
  improvement.


  It’s about visualizing the value you bring to your job, even if you think it
  is unglamorous. This reframing involves altering the boundaries of our job
  descriptions in ways that make our jobs more meaningful and substantive.


  My job is not to write code, or figure out communications strategies, but this
  issue seems to sit on the cusp of good customer service, and I do have
  extensive experience in that. Additionally, I blog and have some other related
  skills and interests that can be brought to bear. We need to reframe who we
  are viewing as our main customer.


  **Begin seeing yourself as part of something greater, and being able to
  influence your world.**

At work, we just went through a massive software upgrade. With each of the upgrades more and more of our colleagues, physicians, nurses, everyone, fall further and further behind, despite the many man-hours devoted to training. At one of our Informatics Committee meetings, while discussing this issue, someone said, “If they aren’t opening their emails and reading the memos, that’s not our problem.” This is a situation David Sturt’s book, _Great Work_, asks us to focus on.
