  ### Create More Betterness


  > "The vast majority of people want to grow, to thrive, to contribute, to make
  a difference. Those are the people I want to encourage, to cultivate, to build
  and expand my company around. I'm not going to operate my business based on
  the lowest common denominator. I'm going to do whatever I can to cultivate the
  philanthropic impulse that exists in most people."- Cat Cassidy, Greater Than
  Yourself, page 127


  I think it’s easy to get wrapped up in problems; the challenges of the here
  and now. One of the things I love most about the concept of Greater Than
  Yourself (or GTY, for short) is that it encourages you to mentally move beyond
  today’s insignificant issues. By constantly scanning your network for people
  who could benefit from your knowledge, skills or contacts and simultaneously
  doing a self assessment of what it is you have to give, you’re forced to think
  “big picture”. In essence, you’re training your mind to look for ways to
  maximize your contribution to the planet by leveraging other peoples’ desire
  to make a difference with their lives. And, in providing to those people who
  are working to make a difference, I believe we can reduce the impact of those
  few people who seem determined to be miserable. GTY, for me, is about looking
  for specific ways to empower others with the knowledge, skills and contacts
  that I have developed over the years (and continue to develop, daily).

  ### GTY tithing


  > "I tithe a percentage of my time to my GTY projects."- Cat Cassidy, Greater
  Than Yourself, page 129


  We’re all busy. It’s one of the biggest complaints of the 21st century: “I
  don’t have enough time”. So if we’re so time starved, how can we possibly
  think of donating some of our time to helping other people make a difference?
  Farber’s elegant answer is appropriated from the Christian faith; the concept
  of “tithing”. Tithing, effectively, is the act of donating a percentage of
  your income (typically 10%) to the church. The concept works because it’s a
  standard percentage that’s preset and then followed religiously (pardon the
  pun). One of Farber’s characters, Cat Cassidy, suggests that the concept of
  tithing can be applied to GTY projects. If Cat knows that she typically works
  60-70 hours per week, then she knows – up front – that she plans to “tithe”
  6-7 hours that week to GTY projects; people that can benefit from her
  experience, connections and knowledge. What the percentage is, and whether
  it’s of work hours, leisure hours or total waking hours is up to you. The
  value is in setting a standard, then sticking to it each week.


  Something that wasn’t mentioned in the book, but I wanted to add to the
  concept, is the energy you gain through the act of adding value to someone’s
  life. I can tell you from personal experience that I’ve had friends or clients
  call and share successes with me – successes that I had some small part in
  creating – and it’s an unbelievable surge of energy. I actually get so charged
  from those calls that my productivity increase almost always exceeds the time
  I would have spent on the project in the first place.

  ### You've Got A Lot to Give (Seriously)


  > "...first thing is to recognize what you have, then take personal
  accountability for increasing it every waking hour of every day of your
  life."- Plumeria Maple, Greater Than Yourself, page 47


  When many of us think of “philanthropy”, we think of cash donations. Maybe
  some people think of volunteering time at a soup kitchen or a church
  fundraiser. But philanthropy is about a lot more than simply money and time.
  And it also has a much wider spread than simply to the homeless or sick. As
  mentioned earlier in this article, we can give knowledge. We can lend or teach
  skills. We can share contacts and experiences. Most of us have far more to
  offer than we give ourselves credit for. If the GTY philosophy is about
  leveraging our human experience by sharing pieces of it with worthy people, we
  must first take stock of what we have to give.


  In _Greater Than Yourself,_ a character named Plumeria Maple has Steve (the
  protagonist of the story) create an inventory of what he has to offer. To make
  the exercise easier, she suggests Steve make lists. Lists like “Meaningful
  Experiences I’ve Had”, “Things I Do Well” or “People I Know”. It’s a neat
  exercise for a couple reasons. First, it’s a big confidence booster to remind
  you of all the experience, knowledge and skills you’ve gained over the years.
  It’s also a great first step in looking for ways to “donate” some of what you
  have to offer with people around you. Being aware of what you have to give
  makes it a whole lot easier to actually do so.
f_conclusion: >-
  The _Greater Than Yourself_ concept – effectively the act of “paying it
  forward”, giving of yourself without expecting payment or reward, is not a new
  one. As Farber admits in the beginning of the book, the “Golden Rule” has been
  around since the dawn of humanity… which is perhaps why it’s so important that
  we continue to reconnect with the concept. It is fundamentally “human” to want
  to provide value to others. The positive emotions and peace of mind that come
  from helping others succeed is a part of our genetic makeup. In _Greater Than
  Yourself_, Steve Farber does a tremendous job of reminding us of that fact,
  and of teaching us how to tap into that desire in our day-to-day lives. I
  highly recommend this book.

Friday night I had plans to go to a friend’s rooftop BBQ and potentially a late night poker game. I bailed on both and spent the night on the couch reading Steve Farber’s latest masterpiece _Greater Than Yourself_. Contrary to my original plans, Farber’s characters, rapid fire dialogue and slightly mysterious plot took priority over burgers, beer and pocket aces.

Keep in mind that Farber writes Business books. This was not the most recent Tom Clancy or Twilight book that was messing with my social calendar. But, in the spirit of his first two books The Radical Leap and The Radical Edge, Farber has opted for the “business fable” which, as Robin Sharma and I discussed in our Horse’s Mouth discussion earlier this year, may very well be the way of the future in business and personal development books. There’s something about integrating a narrative – characters, and a story – into business lessons that makes them that much more impactful and memorable; maybe even more memorable than real life case studies. We get into the heads of the characters – we learn as they learn and we question as they question. We love stories and, when they’re written properly, we can learn a great deal from them. So, what do we learn from _Greater Than Yourself_?

_“I’ve come to see that limited opportunity – at work or anywhere else – is more illusion than reality. An illusion that we perpetuate by believing that success is a zero-sum game.”_

Gene Zander, _Greater Than Yourself_, page 67

_Greater Than Yourself_ is a great story, wrapped around a fairly simple, yet powerful message: True Leadership is about regularly giving away our knowledge, experience, insights and contacts. It’s about constantly scanning for those people around you who want to make a difference in the world and instilling greatness in them by providing them with all the resources you have at your disposal. _Greater Than Yourself_ is instruction and a reminder that when we give of ourselves, we gain from that experience. We gain loyalty, reputation and a sense of accomplishment that exceeds any pride we typically have in our own accomplishments. If that sounds a bit “flakey” or “soft” for you, Farber grounded the point for me with a concept I’ll paraphrase here:

If you’re a parent, think about your children. How does it feel when your child succeeds? How does that feeling compare to your own successes?

Parents in healthy relationships with their children will agree that while they still take pride (obviously) in their own accomplishments, there is something complex and wonderfully enriching about watching their children succeed. There is a depth of satisfaction that cannot be explained. The concept from Greater Than Yourself is something like that – when we unconditionally give of ourselves to those who we choose to help, the sense of accomplishment is virtually indescribable.
