  ### Relationships Are King


  > "Concentrate on the relationships, not the technologies. In the groundswell,
  relationships are everything. The way people connect with each other – the
  community that is created – determines how the power shifts."- Groundswell,
  page 18


  Li and Bernoff make it very clear from the beginning: it’s about
  relationships, not technology. The technology changes faster than we can keep
  up with. Take social networks, for example. First, we had Friendster and
  MySpace, and now we have Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. Regardless of the
  technology, one common thread remains: people want to connect; they want to
  maintain and build relationships.


  The book describes many instances when these powerful groundswell connections
  and relationships have successfully challenged the status quo. New Line Cinema
  had to include a new line in the movie _Snakes on a Plane_ for its star,
  Samuel L. Jackson because online fans demanded it. Fans of the NBC show
  _Jericho_ postponed the TV series’ cancellation by banding together online and
  coordinating the delivery of $50,000 worth of peanuts (that’s 20 tons!) to the
  producers of the show. There are hundreds of these stories being created and
  distributed, and they cannot be ignored. To do so would be at your
  organization’s peril.

  ### P.O.S.T.


  > "I saw that Sears has started \[an online\] community, and I wondered if we
  should do one, too… I’m not really sure \[what my objective is\], but if Sears
  is doing it, I’m sure we need to be looking into it."- Groundswell, page 65


  So often we witness organizations jumping into the social media pool without
  properly understanding it and end up floundering, or worse, drowning.
  Companies jump on Twitter and Facebook because, well, everyone’s doing it. Li
  and Berhoff caution against this misguided non-strategy. Instead, they
  recommend the POST method:


  *   People – what are your customers, and your employees, ready for?

  *   Objectives – what do you hope to achieve?

  *   Strategy – how do you want to influence your relationships with your
  customers?

  *   Technology – what applications and technologies should you use?


  Note that technology comes last, _after_ the first three have been decided.
  That’s because it doesn’t make sense to build a customer wiki, for example, if
  your objective is to listen and monitor what people are saying about your
  brand online, because a wiki’s outcome is collaboration, not listening.


  This might seem overly simplistic, but take a look around at the haphazardly
  put together Facebook pages and barely active Twitter accounts. It’s clear to
  me that many businesses today jump on the social media bandwagon without first
  clarifying and understanding the POST framework above.

  ### Shift Your Thinking


  > "Marketers tell us they define and manage brands. \[…\] Bull. Your brand is
  whatever your customers say it is. And in the groundswell where they
  communicate with each other, they decide."- Groundswell, page 78


  The groundswell gains its power from its community, its users. Your
  organization can say they make the best luggage in the world, but if customer
  reviews complain about the zippers breaking and the exterior plastic cracking,
  then your marketing is as good as nonexistent. Why? Because the rise of the
  internet and free flow of information has enabled and encouraged consumers to
  obtain information from each other, which they view as more trustworthy than
  the information they receive from companies trying to sell them products in
  the first place!


  The groundswell is happening, whether you want it to or not. To embrace the
  groundswell, your organization needs to undergo a significant mental and
  oftentimes, strategic shift. Particularly for your marketing department, it
  means a shift from simply shouting (traditional advertising) to listening,
  talking, and engaging (groundswell marketing).


  Becoming a part of the groundswell may mean hearing things about your brand
  that you might not want to hear. It may mean having to admit you’re wrong or
  having to respond to customer complaints. But it can also mean gaining
  strategic insight to improve your product or create marketing that resonates
  with your target audience. Your organization needs to be ready and willing to
  accept both outcomes. Your customers are talking about your company, brand,
  and products, whether you’re present or not. Wouldn’t you rather be there to
  listen, be a part of the conversation, and act when necessary?
f_conclusion: >-
  Though _Groundswell_ is targeted at and written for executives, managers,
  researchers, marketers, and strategists in large organizations (case studies
  range from Best Buy and Dell to Unilever and General Motors), the content and
  research are invaluable and highly actionable for anyone who “doesn’t get
  social media” and is looking for a great resource to help them not only
  understand, but also plan ahead.

  "The groundswell is a social trend in which people use technologies to get the
  things they need from each other, rather than from traditional institutions

Charlene Li and Josh Bernoff, principal analysts at top research firm Forrester Research, have written an invaluable how-to guide for organizations and businesspeople on how to approach social media. Grounded in meticulous research, _Groundswell_ is written clearly and simply. Each chapter opens with a personal story and contains multiple case studies, making it incredibly easy for readers to understand and absorb the book’s insights.

Although _Groundswell_ was published in 2008 – and three years can seem like three lifetimes in this fast-paced technology world we live in – the book remains highly relevant for anyone seeking to make sense of “this social media thing.”
