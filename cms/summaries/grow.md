  ### The Ideal Factor – What is it?


  > "…align your business with a fundamental human ideal, you can achieve
  extraordinary growth…."- Grow, page 16


  Stengel’s notion of an ‘ideal’ is turning up more and more these days,
  building on the great lessons from Simon Sinek ([_Start With
  Why_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/start-with-why/) and [_Leaders
  Eat Last_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/leaders-eat-last/)_)_,
  Adam Grant ([_Give and
  Take_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/give-and-take/)_)_, Bruce
  Poon Tip
  ([_Looptail_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/looptail/)_),_ David
  Novak ([_Taking People With
  You_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/taking-people-with-you/)_)_
  and Jon Gordon (_The Carpenter_).


  So, what is a ‘brand ideal’? Stengel describes it as:


  1.  A brand’s essential reason for being, the higher-order benefit it brings
  the world.

  2.  The factor connecting the core beliefs of the people inside a business
  with the values of the people they serve.

  3.  Not social responsibility or altruism but a plan for profit and growth
  based on improving people’s lives.


  Stengel argues that having a ‘brand ideal’ is:


  1.  The key to unlock the code for twenty-first century business success.

  2.  The only sustainable way to recruit, unite and motivate internal and
  external people.

  3.  The most powerful lever to achieve a competitive advantage.


  If I were to ask you “Why does your brand exist?” What would be your first
  response?


  *   To serve shareholders?

  *   To make a profit?

  *   To provide a service?


  Those replies are pretty common but they will not drive your business to
  success the way a brand ideal will. They describe _outcomes_, not reasons why
  you exist.


  Think bigger.


  Stengel assures us that every business in the world has a potential
  growth-driving ideal at its center.


  I bet your company has a vision (where you want to go) and a strategy and even
  a statement of what you are trying to achieve. But have you activated this in
  terms of a life-improving idea? Think of it this way. Why does your business
  ultimately exist, beyond serving the shareholder? This is what will drive
  growth!


  How does your brand benefit the world? Stengel identified five categories from
  which to choose;


  1.  **Eliciting joy** – eg. Coca Cola, Mastercard, Moët & Chandon

  2.  **Enabling connection** – eg. FedEx, Starbucks

  3.  **Inspiring exploration** – eg. Amazon.com, Apple, Red Bull

  4.  **Evoking pride** – eg. Hermes, Calvin Klein, L’Occitane

  5.  **Impacting society** – eg. Sensodyne, Dove, Method


  Bottom line: “If your business or brand is not serving an ideal in one of
  these five fields of fundamental human values you’re likely not positioned for
  significant growth.”

  ### Something bigger


  > "We all want to be a part of something bigger than ourselves…"- Grow, page
  63


  Let’s take just one of the must-dos from above: “Communicate your ideal”.


  Do you jump out of bed each day – excited about the contribution you are going
  to make? Do your people?


  It starts with your leadership. Leaders of the fastest-growing businesses in
  the world have relationships to their businesses not primarily as operators
  but rather artists whose medium is an ideal.


  I have sat through too many sales presentations from senior leaders who
  project numbers and market share growth targets. The people are left less than
  motivated and the leaders wonder why. Imagine a VP on the stage announcing:
  _“Next year our goal is to see a 4 percent growth in market share!”_ (Yawn.)


  I work in the pharmaceutical industry and love seeing the difference in the
  audience when a VP says instead: _“Next year our goal is to help 10,000 more
  people who are suffering from this debilitating condition.”_


  And this is the beginning of many small but important changes in
  communication. How leadership talks internally resonates outwardly. Simple
  adjustments in how people communicate have incredible repercussions.

  ### The ideal tree and 5 must-dos


  > "Beliefs and values are not tools; they shape your ability to use your
  tools."- Grow, page 56


  So now that we know that ideals create growth, how do we activate them?
  Stengel uses a tree to explain. Much like a tree, brands are living things
  that have roots, they thrive with the right conditions, and they die without
  care.


  Beneath the tree, feeding the root system are **the people the brand serves**.
  The root system is composed of the **core beliefs** of the brand and the
  **values the brand shares** with the people it serves. The trunk of the tree
  illustrates the brand’s points of difference and points of clarity. The five
  branches of the tree are fruit-bearing parts of a business. They are the five
  must-dos:


  1.  **Discover an ideal** in one of five fields of fundamental human values.

  2.  **Build** your culture around your ideal.

  3.  **Communicate** your ideal to engage employees and customers.

  4.  **Deliver** a near-ideal customer experience.

  5.  **Evaluate** your progress and people against your ideal.
f_conclusion: >-
  Working in the pharmaceutical industry where we make life-changing,
  life-saving drugs I was surprised and dismayed to see that there wasn’t one
  pharma company in the top 50. It seems so obvious that we should be focusing
  on the benefit we bring to the world. Yet, our trustworthiness is at an
  all-time low. Perhaps it’s time to shift our thinking.

> "Maximum growth and high ideals are not incompatible. They’re inseparable." _\- Grow, page 1_

“What do the world’s 50 best brands have in common?” wondered Jim Stengel (then the global marketing officer of Procter & Gamble). He set out to answer this question by performing a 10 year growth study of 50,000 brands. The study tracked the connection over a 10 year period between financial performance and customer engagement, loyalty, and advocacy.

He zoomed in on the top 50 brands now referred to as “The Stengel 50”. If you had invested in these brands over the last 10 years, you would have been 400 percent more profitable than if you had invested in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500! So what’s the secret? What did the top 50 do differently?

Stengel discovered that the most profitable brands focus on their _brand ideal._ In other words, they focus on their higher order benefit to the world. Jim summarized it simply by saying “_Great businesses have great ideals_.”

What a relief! He offers proof that corporations outperform their competitors by doing good!

What exactly is an ideal and how do you achieve growth through this ideal? This summary shares an abridged version of Stengel’s explanation of an ideal and the 5 must-dos to achieve growth with your ideal. We also zoom in on just one must-do: the need to communicate your ideal to engage people internally and externally.

Do you jump out of bed each day – excited about the contribution you are going to make? Do your people?

Working in the pharmaceutical industry where we make life-changing, life-saving drugs I was surprised and dismayed to see that there wasn’t one pharma company in the top 50. It seems so obvious that we should be focusing on the benefit we bring to the world. Yet, our trustworthiness is at an all-time low. Perhaps it’s time to shift our thinking.

My vision is of a world where pharma professionals are an integral part of the health care team. A world where they are respected for the life saving and life changing medicines that they create and trusted for the knowledge they contribute. A world where social good and corporate good are aligned. A world where pharma believes that when patients come first, everyone wins.

Stengel provides solid evidence that this vision can come true. We just need leaders in our industry to realize that profitability results from doing the right thing – focusing on the patient in how we think, feel and act. This is indeed the true path to a sustainable cycle of business success.

_What is your brand ideal and how do you communicate it?_
