  ### Instill the ‘Hacker Way’


  > "The Hacker Way is an approach to building that involves continuous
  improvement and iteration. Hackers believe that something can always be
  better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it— often
  in the face of people who say it's impossible or are content with the status
  quo."- Hacking Marketing, Kindle Edition, locations 453-455


  _Hacking Marketing_ is about inspiring an innovation culture across your
  marketing organization. Marketing technology has long been a cross-pollination
  from other disciplines such as psychology, data science, industrial
  engineering, traditional marketing, sales, and computer science. Brinker
  describes several reasons that marketing can and should emulate software
  development strategies and tactics. Why is ‘hacking’ necessary?


  Modern marketing requires managing many projects, tactics and responses
  necessary to keep up with today’s customer driven marketplace. These marketing
  challenges parallel many found in current software development.


  While referring to Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg’s IPO filing on the ‘Hacker
  Way’, Brinker points out that the culture of hacking was originally and still
  is a positive force in discovering better services through smaller and
  iterative releases rather than trying to get everything done all at once. In
  doing so, the service and the teams that develop them become fluid, impactful
  and open to innovative concepts keeping pace with a changing landscape.
  Brinker covers different areas of the ‘Hacker Way’ including:


  *   An in-depth examination of agile and lean management methods applied to
  marketing.

  *   An exploration of opportunities and techniques for innovation in modern
  marketing.

  *   A collection of ideas to tame digital complexity and achieve new kinds of
  scalability in marketing.

  *   A closing chapter on managing marketing talent in this digital
  environment.

  ### Seek out ‘T-Shaped’ People


  > "These \[full-stack marketers\] are T-shaped people: deep in at least one
  area but proficient across many."- Hacking Marketing, Kindle Edition,
  locations 4248-4249


  Marketers take on more roles and skills than ever before. Having to be
  knowledgeable from fundamentals to the already digital orchestration tools and
  tactics takes on a new meaning of Renaissance marketer. How can anyone person
  or team manage both the breadth and depth necessary in a dynamic environment?


  Brinker believes that hiring for the right marketing technology roles requires
  a team of generalists who have some select specializations. These ‘T-shaped’
  hires would have complete understanding of the entire process and
  collaboratively solve for any clarification that come their way. The
  collective also provides multiple insights, perspectives and opportunities to
  learn from one another.


  Aside from their skills, ‘T-shaped’ people have attributes of curiosity, high
  emotional quotient, and strong sense of teamwork.

  ### Become Customer-Obsessed


  > "Like software, this customer centricity has combined with the adaptability
  of a digital canvas to encourage greater experimentation."- Hacking Marketing,
  Kindle Edition, location 1091


  Customer centricity and customer experience (CX) describe an opportunity for
  marketers to deliver their messaging and engagement with greater control and
  granularity at scale. Various studies have shown that it is many more times
  expensive to acquire a new customer than retain a current one. Becoming
  customer-obsessed changes the mindset of an organization, marketing and
  beyond, to consider how their process, temperament and responses impact the
  perception and lifetime value of a customer.


  _Hacking Marketing_ describes the dynamic machine required to manage the
  customer experience. With a focus on the customer for positive growth, an
  organization recognizes that everyone is not the same. Selecting the right
  tools and people are critical to ensure any customer based goals are achieved.
  Being adaptive at scale can be a fundamental, but necessary, change for many
  organizations.
f_conclusion: >-
  Brinker’s overarching theme of curiosity and adaptability in marketing are
  critical to meet the ever-changing marketplace. Marketing now oversees the
  broader customer journey which rarely begins with an in-person conversation
  and certainly never ends at the sale. The groundswell of a direct digital
  consumer engagement can deliver greater impact than a multi-million dollar
  Superbowl ad.

  The good kind [of hacking] makes new inventions— in fast, fluid, and fun ways.
  It imagines what's possible, figures out clever ways to realize those ideas
  within the tangle of real-world constraints, and above all, celebrates the
  courage to try, tinker, and learn.
