  ### Are your successes impostors?


  > "Pointless… victories may… be the single biggest threat to talented and
  ambitious people… for they lead them away from where they actually want to
  go."- Hannibal and Me, page 287


  You’ve undoubtedly heard the phrase “win the battle but loose the war.” This
  principle is the crux of Kluth’s idea that Hannibal’s successes were
  impostors. Hannibal won every battle on his way from Carthage, across the
  Iberian peninsula, through the Alps, and ultimately each clash with the
  Romans; but, he eventually left having lost the war. Why? These victories came
  at a detrimentally high cost to Hannibal. His army had a limited number of men
  and provisions. Fabius, a senator in Rome, understood that Hannibal was not
  invincible and could be beat by simply waiting him out. Fabius knew that
  Hannibal’s men were tired and worn from their journey and had little hope for
  reinforcements. By contrast Rome was well fortified, had ample provisions, and
  had several times the number of men than Hannibal’s forces. This required
  Hannibal to meet the Romans on a stage that played to his weaknesses.


  Hannibal’s successes were impostors, they were impressive battles but they did
  not move him towards his ultimate goal of making Carthage a more free and
  prosperous Mediterranean power. Hannibal spent 13 years moving around Italy
  but never directly attacked Rome nor did he come close to having the Romans
  return control of vital trading routes which had been the genesis of the
  conflict. This is why we read about the single event of the elephants and the
  voyage across the Alps but use Roman architecture for our buildings and model
  our transportation systems on Roman ideas. The author explains that victories
  should be employed as tools rather than as goals in order to avoid having your
  successes become impostors.

  ### Don't be a victim of your own success


  > "Success, \[is\] a kind of death, I think, and it can come to you in a storm
  of royalty checks beside a kidney-shaped pool in Beverly Hills or anywhere at
  all that is removed from the conditions that made you an artist."- Tennessee
  Williams, quoted in Hannibal and Me, page 178


  Why mess with success? After all, success is never guaranteed so once we
  obtain some why mess with the formula, right? Wrong. Treating success in this
  manner, Kluth says, will leave us trapped and will make us unlikely to
  continue to produce success. He explains that because Hannibal had remained
  undefeated in Italy, it made it difficult for him to abandon his pursuit since
  he hadn’t lost. But his successes left him trapped. Had he lost he could have
  reevaluated his strategy and decided how to proceed. However, since he hadn’t
  he was trapped in “the catastrophe of success.”


  The author shares the story of American playwright Tennessee Williams who, in
  the 1940s, had a blockbuster hit with _The Glass Menagerie_, which thrust him
  into the spotlight. For some time after that hit, the playwright was unable to
  create anything else. He stopped writing and abandoned all that had made him a
  success and coined the phrase “the catastrophe of success.” You become
  unwilling to try something new because now people are paying attention, you
  don’t want to disappoint them. What if your new work isn’t as good as your
  first work? The solution: Don’t become distracted once you experience even a
  modicum of success, for it is a fickle friend. If you are a writer don’t spend
  all your time doing things other than writing. If you have developed a number
  of faithful customers don’t skimp on service once the pace quickens.


  _“Don’t agonize about success or failure. Just do what you must do as well as
  you possibly can. In the process you may eventually transcend triumph and
  disaster.”_


  Reading about Hannibal helped me to understand that all success is not equal
  and rather than strive to be successful every time, one must be willing to
  turn down some success in order to head in the right direction. It helped me
  realize that for my version of success in graduate school it is not about the
  grade in the specific class but my desire to educate myself and grow. I’ve had
  classes where I have received above average marks but didn’t learn much, so my
  desire to grow and educate myself wasn’t furthered. Hannibal helped me realize
  that I was playing tee to green therefore the “success” of the grades I
  received were impostors.


  How do you plan to avoid an impostor of success?

  ### Play Green To Tee


  > "Ordinary golfers, and ordinary people in life, play ‘tee-to-green,’... They
  hit the ‘best’ shot every time, which they assume to be the longest and most
  impressive drive, or the job with the highest pay and most power, or the
  rhetorical victory during a conference, or perhaps an Alpine crossing.
  Afterward they sometimes find that their big shots have led them into a ‘bad
  lie’—in the rough, where they can no longer see the pin—and they get
  frustrated and fail."- Hannibal and Me, page 132


  Kluth uses the example of golf to explain what Hannibal should have done to be
  victorious in his conquest against Rome. Rather than tee up and attempt to
  drive the ball as far as possible, a green to tee golfer frames every shot by
  working in reverse from the green. Therefore, the optimal shot is not
  necessarily the one that goes the farthest nor is the most entertaining to
  watch, but the one that places the ball in the best location for the next
  shot. Golf is a simple game with the goal being to put the ball in the hole in
  the fewest number of shots, but often people loose sight of that objective and
  swing for the fences rather than align their efforts with a strategy of
  getting to the green.


  Hannibal fell prey to the same dilemma. His goal was to improve Carthage’s
  power and dominance in the Mediterranean. Yet often the battles he fought
  placed Carthage in an increasingly defensive position and farther from
  reclaiming lost territories and trade routes. Sure the battles are interesting
  to read about some 2,000 years later but they were inconsistent with
  Hannibal’s overall goal and came at too high a price.


  In playing “green to tee” you can work backwards from where you want to end up
  and fill in the steps that will get you there. Your efforts may not be flashy
  or entertaining for others to observe. But in playing “green to tee” it is not
  about show, it is about acting in a way that moves you towards your goal.

> "The greater a man's successes, the less it must be trusted to endure." _\- Hannibal and Me, page 17_

In school, I remember reading about Hannibal and how he crossed the Alps with elephants to attack the Romans. While I was familiar with the Roman empire I had heard little about Carthage, Hannibal’s home. If Hannibal and his troops accomplished such a feat why don’t we read about the Carthaginian contributions to the modern world? Andreas Kluth, an investment banker turned journalist and author of _Hannibal and Me: What Histoy’s Greatest Military Strategist Can Teach Us About Success and Failure_, believes that while Hannibal’s successes were impressive, they nevertheless were impostors that in the end cost him his ultimate objective. Kluth believes that we can learn from Hannibal and his encounters with success and failure.
