  ### Reconciling Present and Future


  > "Happy people live secure in the knowledge that the activities that bring
  them enjoyment in the present will also lead to a fulfilling future."-
  Happier, page 15


  At the core of this book lies The Happiness Model, or as the author likes to
  call it, The Hamburger Model. Ben-Shahar shares the story of how he was
  training for one of the most important squash tournaments of the year, and
  focused on healthy eating. As soon as he finished the tournament he went to
  get his favourite food: hamburgers. He ordered four hamburgers, but couldn’t
  bring himself to eat the meal he’d been waiting all month for. His body felt
  cleansed and full of energy, after only eating healthy and he knew that eating
  the burgers would make him feel badly. The Hamburger Model was born.


  Each one of the four hamburgers represents a distinct archetype and each
  archetype describes a distinct pattern of attitudes and beliefs.

  1.  Hedonism (Junk Food Burger)– Enjoy the present and ignore the potential
  negative consequences of their actions

  2.  Rat race (Vegetarian Burger)– Suffer now for the purpose of some
  anticipated gain

  3.  Nihilism (Terrible Burger) – Have lost the lust for life, someone who
  neither enjoys the moment nor has a sense of future purpose

  4.  Happiness (Perfect Burger)– Enjoyment in the future and in the present


  Ben-Shahar breaks down each of these models further to describe how a person
  living in each of the four quadrants thinks, acts and behaves.


  **Rat Race**


  The society we live in teaches us to focus on the next goal and
  accomplishment, rather than the present experience. The rat racer believes
  when they reach a certain destination they will be happy. However the problem
  with this belief is that rat racers are unable to enjoy what they are doing
  now.


  The rat racer is only rewarded at the completion of the journey. When they
  finally do attain a goal, the rat racer thinks they feel “happiness,” but it
  is really just relief. The rat racer then continues to chase after more goals,
  thinking that will make them happy.


  **Hedonism**


  The hedonist is focused only on seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. The
  hedonist fulfils their present desire and gives no thought to the future
  consequences. Since the hedonist is focused only on the present, they will do
  anything that will provide them with the immediate gratification they desire.


  **Nihilism**


  In this book, a nihilist is a person who has given up on happiness, and is
  resigned to the belief that life has no meaning. They expect the same sort of
  life in the future, and are restrained by their past failures.


  **Happiness**


  In this quadrant, an individual is happy in both the present and the future.
  Although it is not possible to be happy all the time, it is possible to spend
  time engaged in activities with both a present and future benefit.


  The rat racer is a slave to the future; the hedonist is a slave to the moment,
  and the nihilist a slave to the past. Focusing on being happy now and in the
  future is the pathway to true happiness.

  ### Crafting our Calling


  > "It takes conscious and concerted effort to find our calling because we are
  usually encouraged to pursue what we do well rather than what we want to do."-
  Happier, page 102


  When it comes to crafting your calling, look at three main factors: Ben-Shahar
  calls this the MPS process or the Meaning, Pleasure, and Strengths Process.
  Searching for work that amplifies our passions and strengths can be
  challenging, so asking these three questions can help to craft your calling.


  1.  What gives me meaning?

  2.  What gives me pleasure?

  3.  What are my strengths?


  Examining the answers and identifying any areas of overlap can help to
  determine the type of work that could make you happy. It is important to
  understand that is it not just the work we do, but how we perceive work as
  well. When it comes to happiness in the workplace, it is our responsibility to
  find the right role and create the right conditions for ourselves.

  ### Setting Self-Concordant Goals


  > "Goals are means, not just ends. For sustained happiness we need to change
  the expectations we have of our goals, rather than perceiving them as ends
  (expecting that their attainment will make us happy), we need to see them as
  means (recognizing that they can enhance the pleasure we take in the
  journey)."- Happier, page 70-71


  Goals help us to create a reality for ourselves, rather than reacting to what
  is going on in our world. They are a way to communicate to ourselves, and the
  people around us, that we believe we are able to overcome any obstacle.
  Setting the goal is a great first step, but it’s often the verbal commitment
  we communicate to others that helps us achieve happiness.


  When we set goals that bring us meaning and pleasure, they liberate us and
  allow us to enjoy the present moment. A clear destination gives us guidance so
  we can focus our full attention on making the most of where we are now.


  Ben-Shahar suggests we focus on setting only self-concordant goals: those that
  we wish to pursue out of deep personal conviction and have a strong interest
  in. In order for these to have the most impact they should not feel like they
  are imposed on us, but rather stem from a desire to express part of ourselves.


  The best way to set these type of goals is to look at what you **can** do, and
  be realistic about it. Then think about what you would **like** to do, and
  then think about what you really **want** to do. Finally, drill down deeper
  into what you **really, really want to do** and focus your time and energy
  there.
f_conclusion: >-
  I found this book insightful, and it was interesting to see all the studies
  the author conducted, especially in reference to the number of people who do
  not show increased happiness with the attainment of wealth. Through, The
  Hamburger Model, Ben-Shahar took a fun and delicious approach on identifying
  each of the archetypes. I also learned that I do fall into the trap of being a
  rat racer most of the time and need to make a habit to focus on goals that I
  enjoy now and in the future. This book provided a lot of valuable lessons
  anyone can take away and apply to their life to be happier, than they are now.

  “Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way
  toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness is not about making it to the
  peak of the mountain nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain;
  happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak.”

> “Attaining lasting happiness requires that we enjoy the journey on our way toward a destination we deem valuable. Happiness is not about making it to the peak of the mountain nor is it about climbing aimlessly around the mountain; happiness is the experience of climbing toward the peak.” _\- Happier, page 27_

The book _Happier_ is the foundation of one of the most popular and life-changing courses at Harvard. Tal Ben-Shahar, Ph.D. teaches you how to be happier than you are. Through research and scientific studies he draws valuable insight into why some people are happier than others, and recommends exercises you can incorporate into your everyday life to increase your overall level of happiness.

Ben-Shahar believes that happiness is the ultimate currency for any human being. Most people focus on money and fame, falsely believing that these things will make them happier. _Happier_ focuses instead on tactics you can use to live in the present, and set yourself up for happiness in the future.
