  ### Five principles of happy money


  > "Before you spend that $5 as you usually would, stop and ask yourself: Is
  this happy money?"- Happy Money, page xix


  They present 5 principles to spend differently; to spend smarter. When
  applied, these principles can lead to happier people spending less money!


  1. **Buy experiences** – Material things (from big houses to fancy cars) turn
  out to provide less happiness than experiential purchases (like trips,
  concerts and special meals). I’m so glad I just booked that trip!


  2\. **Make it a treat –** Limiting our access to things we really like may
  help invigorate our appreciation and enjoyment from them. Did I ever love my
  Chai Tea latte after I didn’t buy it for a few days.


  3\. **Buy time** – By permitting ourselves to outsource dreaded tasks, money
  can change how we spend time allowing us to pursue more enjoyable things.
  Instead of cleaning on Saturdays, I pay someone to do it so I can go bike
  riding with my kids.


  4\. **Pay now, consume later** – Delaying consumption allows spenders to enjoy
  the anticipation (think of the enjoyment you experience ogling the dessert
  case or thinking about the upcoming trip) without the buzzkill of reality. I
  decided to change our habit of booking our annual family trip last minute to
  booking (and paying) for next year’s trip earlier so we can all enjoy months
  of anticipation


  5\. **Invest in others** – New research shows that spending money on others
  produces more happiness than spending money on oneself. I’m still trying to
  convince my 5-year old of this! But my 10-year old and 17-year old felt great
  joy this Saturday running a book swap to raise money for Room to Read.


  The objective is not to just pick one principle but rather apply as many as
  possible to each spend. They have a cumulative effect. That is, the more
  principles you apply to any given purchase, the more happiness you will reap.
  Let’s go back to the simple latte example. You can increase your enjoyment
  from a $25 investment in a Starbucks gift card by:


  *   Going with a friend to enjoy coffee together (Principle #1)

  *   Putting just enough money on the card to buy regular coffee Monday through
  Thursday but a special double whip, caramel machioto, specialisimo drink on
  Friday (Principle #2)

  *   Changing the way you spend your time – instead of tidying the house to
  invite a friend over – go out to Starbucks (Principle #3)

  *   Paying for the card earlier in the week (Principle #4)

  *   Using it to buy coffee for your friend (Principle #5)

  ### Make it a treat


  > "Abundance, it turns out, is the enemy of appreciation."- Happy Money, page
  27


  One thing that brings me happiness is great chocolate. There are 10 stores
  within 5 minutes of my house that sell great chocolate. But if I bought it
  every day, would I enjoy it as much each time I ate it? Unfortunately it is
  simply a fact that the more we are exposed to something, the more its impact
  diminishes. The solution? Make it a treat. By saving the really good stuff for
  celebrations, it becomes a treat and something I savor.


  Think about how much Charlie (as in _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_)
  enjoyed his treasured annual bar of chocolate, spending days just looking at
  it before he would finally “peel back a tiny bit of the paper wrapping at one
  corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate”. Compare that to the glutinous
  Augustus Gloop chowing down his multitude of bars without barely tasting, let
  alone enjoying them.


  How can you turn things you enjoy into a treat? We make Nanaimo bars only at
  Christmas and everyone looks forward to and thoroughly enjoys this treat. If
  we were to have birthday cake every week I doubt we would enjoy it as much on
  our birthdays. You may be sensing that I have a wicked sweet tooth!

  ### Resist the material, insist on experiential


  > "Research shows that experiences provide more happiness than material goods
  in part because experiences are more likely to make us feel connected to
  others."- Happy Money, page 7


  My daughter is going to university next year and after completing the task of
  choosing which university she would attend, she is now going through the
  stress of selecting the best residence option. I was happy to share with her
  the study that Dunn and Norton conducted about happiness and residences.


  At Harvard, first-year students are randomly assigned to one of twelve
  different residences. Some of them are beautiful, spacious and centrally
  located. While others are, well, not! The night before housing assignments are
  announced, students can be found conducting elaborate rituals to ensure
  themselves a spot in one of the “coveted” residences.


  It was no surprise that their research found that students expected to be much
  happier living in the beautiful, spacious, centrally located residences. What
  was a surprise however was that students who actually did live in those
  desirable locations ended up no more happy than those who landed in the less
  desirable locations. It was the experience of the residence life itself, not
  the location or building that made them happy.


  Let’s take this to adult life. Ninety percent of Americans link home ownership
  to living the American dream. Ironically, however, in a carefully controlled
  study of over 600 women, homeowners weren’t any happier than renters, though
  they were twelve pounds heavier. Huh? If the largest material purchase most of
  us will ever make gives us no increase in happiness, maybe we should rethink
  this dream.


  What did increase happiness was trading in that mortgage for experiences. 57%
  of Americans reported at experiential purchases made them happier than
  material purchases, while 34% reported the opposite. People who spend more of
  their money on leisure report greater satisfaction with their lives.
f_conclusion: >-
  It makes so much sense now – that instead of trying just to make more money,
  we should stop and look at how we are spending the money we have. Perhaps we
  can increase our happiness without making more money! It seems like a
  far-fetched idea (and we have been brainwashed against it in our consumer
  driven economy!) but this book convinced me that it is worth trying.

> "Around the world, income has surprisingly little influence on whether people smile, laugh or experience enjoyment on a typical day." _\- Happy Money, page xiv_

I bet you’ve read a book or two on how to earn, save and invest money but have you ever read one that teaches you how to spend it? You likely think you don’t need any help with that! Did you know that **scientific research exists to show you how to get a bigger happiness bang for your hard-earned bucks?** And that research proves that what we have intuitively been doing doesn’t work!

Elizabeth Dunn and Michael Norton show us that money really can buy happiness. But maybe not in the way we think. They tell us that greater wealth often fails to provide as much happiness as many people expect.

In _Happy Money: The Science of Smarter Spending_ we learn how to stop the never-ending quest reaching higher and higher to make more and more money in search of happiness. It teaches us to shift our focus from _earning more_ to _spending differently_.

What about you? Do you think it’s worth trying?

This summary looked at just 2 principles but there are 3 more that are equally impactful. I encourage you to investigate them and maybe you can shift your focus from _earning more_ to _spending differently_.

To greater happiness (and smarter spending)!
