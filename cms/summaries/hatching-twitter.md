  ### People matter


  > "Some people are destined for greatness; others fall up a hill to get
  there."- Hatching Twitter, page 198


  I expected to read about coding geniuses. And, I did. I expected to learn
  about strategic decisions that lead to greatness. I did. I thought the book
  would be about technology and business. But it was about people. After all,
  what is technology and what is business, if they don’t have to do with people!


  I was surprised to learn Twitter came from some of the same people that
  fostered Blogger, a technology I’d used even before I tried Twitter. Evan
  Williams sold Blogger to Google and invested in Odeo where he met Noah Glass.
  They hired Jack Dorsey, Dick Costolo and others. Odeo eventually went to the
  great recycling bin in the sky, as did a majority of tech startups in Silicon
  Valley.


  What continued, though, were the people and their friendships, their strengths
  and weaknesses, their weekend parties, and their inescapable loneliness.

  ### Don’t hire your friends


  > ""Ev also reasoned that his friends would never betray him.""- Hatching
  Twitter, page 202


  The subtitle of the book states that it will be about friendship and betrayal.
  And it is. Creating something world-changing is a crucible for forging deep
  friendships, but the heat also tears them apart.


  I’d make the same mistakes, I’m sure, of hiring my friends. I’d want to
  surround myself with people who believe in me, who believe in what I’m doing.
  What is a friend if not someone who believes in you?


  If I could, I would want to be generous with my friends and find ways to share
  my success, so I’d hire them to be part of my new start-up. I wouldn’t even
  think twice.


  Yet, the story of Twitter is a story of the loss and the betrayal of
  friendships. Some of the friends were hired for jobs they weren’t right for
  and the relationship died a slow death. Others were right, but had conflict
  over direction of the company, which exploded in betrayal. And, some friends
  stuck together.


  Over 100 times, _Hatching Twitter_ references friends or friendships. This is
  more than a tacit admission that in the end, technology will come and go, but
  people matter. People, not things, give meaning to life.

  ### Technology shortens distance between people


  > "This status idea could be the antidote to all of this, a cure for feeling
  lonely..."- Hatching Twitter, page 56


  Twitter was created to speak to and hear from friends that were separated by
  space and time. Clunky at first, it was used to talk about what someone was
  having for lunch, what music they were listening to, what party they were
  attending, and who they were doing it with.


  It evolved into much more than that. It shortened the distance between people
  and what was happening around the world. Whether it was an _Oprah Show_, the
  Pope or an Iranian revolution, Twitter proved an effective tool at shortening
  the distance between people and the world around them.


  Speaking of distance, the author ends the book with a story about Tweeting
  from the international space station. Commander Hadfield wrote:“Loneliness is
  not so much where you are, but instead is your state of mind.”
f_conclusion: Having said that, I would love to end this summary some other way.

  "This status thing could help connect people to those who weren’t there. It
  wasn’t just about sharing what kind of music you were listening to or where
  you were at that moment; it was about connecting people and making them feel
  less alone."

I am cleaning out some really old magazines piled up on my book case, magazines I never read, but stashed away for when I had more time. (Don’t judge me.) As I finished _Hatching Twitter_, I picked up the March 2008 issue of _Inc._ magazine. On the cover is a bright orange circle with the question: “Twitter – Total brilliance or utter nonsense?”

Fast-forward six years and almost 3000 Tweets later and I’m still not sure I can answer that question. Even my own Tweets have included a little of both the brilliance and the nonsense.

How did I come by this simple 140-character publishing tool I now take for granted? That’s the question answered in _Hatching Twitter_ by Nick Bilton. After reading it, I won’t take Twitter for granted anymore.

_Hatching Twitter_, as the subtitle says, is “A True Story of Money, Power, Friendship, and Betrayal”. It is laced with the F-word, dripping with unexpected and even accidental influence and filled with smart, lonely people.

I had no idea the turmoil that gave flight to the little blue Twitter bird when I sent my first Tweet back in 2008: “@ScottReavely: Teething from my new iPhone!” (Yes, “teething”, true story! Apple auto-correct did not recognize “Tweeting”!)

Having said that, I would love to end this summary some other way.

Part of the drama behind the scenes came from the divergent visions for Twitter. For Jack, it was “What are you doing?” A very personal, status update one might write about himself. For Ev, it was, “What’s happening?” A newsy update on the world around you.

Both of these visions converged for me on Sunday night. I saw a Tweet from someone I didn’t know that said something about a car accident in my town. I looked for news sources that might have news…silence. I turned back to Twitter as tweet after tweet carried the hashtag, #PrayforMaddi. Maddi was a beautiful 17 year-old who played softball with my daughter. My only news source that night was Twitter.

I learned from Twitter the next day that Maddi had passed away. So, “What’s happening?” and “What are you doing?” … “@ScottReavely: Hugging my daughter!”
