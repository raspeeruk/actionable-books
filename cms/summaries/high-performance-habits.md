  ### 6 High Performance Habits


  > "We can all achieve and enjoy long-term success. It just takes the right
  habits."- High Performance Habits, back jacket


  These six habits and three practices to strengthen each habit have been proven
  to help you achieve an extraordinary level of performance. It is our option,
  Brendon says, to wake up each day and choose to practice these habits or not.
  What are they?


  1.  **Seek Clarity**

  2.  Envision the future four—self, social, skills, service

  3.  Determine the feeling you’re after

  4.  Define what’s meaningful

  5.  **Generate Energy**

  6.  Release tension, set intention

  7.  Bring the joy

  8.  Optimize health

  9.  **Raise necessity**

  10.  Know who needs your A game

  11.  Affirm the why

  12.  Level up your squad

  13.  **Increase productivity**

  14.  Increase the outputs that matter

  15.  Chart your five moves

  16.  Get insanely good at key skills (progressive mastery)

  17.  **Develop influence**

  18.  Teach people how to think

  19.  Challenge people to grow

  20.  Role model the way

  21.  **Demonstrate courage**

  22.  Honor the struggle

  23.  Share your truth and ambitions

  24.  Find someone to fight for


  Of course, it’s not enough to just know what the habits are. You need
  continual reminders and practice with feedback. Before every meeting, every
  phone call, and before you start a new project, revisit these habits. You can
  also assess yourself using Burchard’s [High Performance Indicator
  test](https://brendon.mykajabi.com/p/hph-tools).

  ### Develop Your Influence


  > "Influence is strongly correlated with feeling like you’re making a
  difference."- High Performance Habits, page 220


  High performers have influence in part due to their giving mindset. They enter
  situations looking for ways to help others.


  I work with pharmaceutical sales people helping them learn how to be more
  engaging and create better patient outcomes. The top performers don’t need to
  be taught this—they are already doing it. Their number one focus is on how to
  help the physician help the patient. They don’t sell. They serve. And they
  have influence.


  They aren’t “asking for the business,” they are asking the doctors what they
  are paying attention to, how they approach xyz, what would happen if…, what if
  you thought of it this way, etc.—all with a focus on helping improve patient
  outcomes. And as a result, they are doing meaningful work that makes a
  difference. They are more engaged and more engaging!

  ### Telltale Signs Of A High Performer


  > "If you leave your growth to randomness, you’ll always live in a land of
  mediocrity."- High Performance Habits, page 74


  If you were to look in someone’s agenda, what telltale sign would you see that
  would indicate it belongs to a high performer? It turns out that executives
  who score higher on the high performance habits tend to have more blocks of
  time scheduled for learning than their peers with lower scores. They have a
  high internal curiosity and drive to build a deep competence in their field of
  interest.


  They’ve built a curriculum for themselves in that primary field of interest
  and are actively engaged in learning. So, ask yourself _“What three skills are
  you currently working to develop so you’ll be more successful next year?”_


  The loud and clear message is that no matter your current level of
  performance, you must clarify your primary field of interest and the skills
  you will need to master for your next level of success. This must be a
  priority.


  More telltale signs of high achievers? Here is a baker’s dozen:


  1.  They spend more time doing things that they find meaningful and this makes
  them happy

  2.  They give more thought to “What do those I serve want?” instead of “What
  do I want?”

  3.  They think “How can I serve in unique ways?” instead of “Why don’t people
  see my unique strengths?”

  4.  They don’t wait for joy to land on them, they bring the joy!

  5.  They reflect regularly on all they are grateful for

  6.  They seek to insert appreciation, surprise, wonder and challenge into
  their day

  7.  They are optimistic and believe their actions will be rewarded

  8.  They think about how they want to feel and work to generate those
  feelings.

  9.  They prioritize proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, energy breaks

  10.  They set goals and monitor progress

  11.  They are happier and have less stress

  12.  They feel that they are making a difference and being rewarded for it

  13.  Their identify and enjoyment in life are tied to growth


  There are plenty more. Can you picture yourself or someone you admire in the
  list above? Do you see any areas you could improve?
f_conclusion: >-
  We could go through life and in the end say “I never knew _how_ to be a high
  performer.” But now that Burchard has done the research for us, and laid it
  out so succinctly, what will be your excuse? You might as well pick up a copy
  and read it again and again as you practice and improve all the way to your
  best life!

> “Study high performers and you will see that they have systems built into their days that drive their success.” _\- High Performance Habits, page xiv_

How would your life change if you could say _“I now know exactly how to be consistently at my best”?_ What if you had a field-tested and science-backed path to improve your life? That’s what Brendon Burchard offers in _High Performance Habits_.

This book answers three questions Burchard has been researching for the last twenty years:

1.  Why do some individuals and teams succeed more quickly than others, and sustain that success over the long term?
2.  Of those who pull it off, why are some miserable and others happy on their journey?
3.  What motivates people to reach for higher levels of success in the first place, and what kinds of habits, training, and support help them improve faster?

Burchard’s high performance studies led him to interview, coach, and train many of the world’s most successful and happiest people, from CEO,’s to high-level entrepreneurs, to entertainers, to 1.6 million students from 195 countries.

He has proven that with the right habits, anyone can dramatically increase results and become a high performer in almost any field. High performance is not achieved by a particular type of person, but rather by a specific set of practices, which he calls high performance habits. He lines them up, explains them, illustrates them, and promises that whether you are a student, entrepreneur, manager, CEO, athlete, or stay-at-home parent, these habits will help you reach your next level. What are you waiting for?
