  ### Smart creatives


  > "Not every smart creative has all of these characteristics, in fact very few
  of them do. But they all must possess business savvy, technical knowledge,
  creative energy, and a hands-on approach to getting things done. Those are the
  fundamentals."- How Google Works, page 19


  Smart Creatives are the lifeblood of Google. They are the employees Google
  seeks to hire — independent thinkers who are both experts in their technical
  field, but also have the other attributes necessary to thrive in their
  environment.


  The authors attribute Google’s success partially to the company’s vision, but
  mostly to their focus on hiring smart creatives, and their willingness to give
  these employees complete freedom.


  Why is this so important? As the authors write, “The basis for success, and
  for continual product excellence, is speed.” By employing people whom you
  trust to make decisions independently, you can avoid a lot of the bureaucracy
  that slows down many companies.


  Surprisingly, the model for this is not corporate America, but academia, where
  graduate students are given direction and guidance from their supervisors, but
  also have the freedom to explore whatever topics they think are useful. This
  is why Google’s main office is known as a campus.

  ### Radical transparency


  > "\[Everyone is\] obligated to dissent if they believe something is incorrect
  or not in the best interests of the client. Everyone’s opinion counts. While
  you might be hesitant to disagree with the team’s most senior member or the
  client, you’re expected to share your point of view."- How Google Works, page
  41


  In order to create a culture where everyone achieves without having to be
  babysat, Google has made a strong effort to foster a spirit of radical
  transparency in the organization. Everyone is on the same page in terms of
  what the company stands for and what they’re trying to accomplish, and nobody
  is above the rules.


  First and foremost, Google employees are required to be very public with their
  priorities and what they’re working on. Everyone from the lowest employee up
  to the CEO releases OKRs and snippets. OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are
  public, quantifiable goals that are published quarterly. Snippets are quick
  daily or weekly updates of important activities and achievements. Through
  these two systems any Google employee can get a pretty good feel for any other
  employee’s work situation.


  To complement this freedom of information, Google employees are encouraged to
  give negative feedback. They do detailed, formalized post-mortems after most
  tasks and hold company-wide TGIF meetings each Friday, where any topic is fair
  game and employees often critique those above them.

  ### Hire the best


  > "The objective is to create a hiring culture that resists the siren song of
  compromise, a song that only gets louder amidst the chaotic whirlwind of
  hypergrowth."- How Google Works, page 100


  Google, as a company, has an obsessive focus on hiring the right people.
  They’ve realized that a team of great people not only does great work, it
  attracts more great people! This “herd effect” is even more pronounced early
  in a company, when early hires will impact who chooses to join the team in the
  future. As attraction, selection, and attrition play out over time, an
  organization becomes increasingly homogenous in its culture, so make sure to
  choose wisely.


  How to choose wisely? Google uses four criteria in evaluating new hires:
  general cognitive ability, role-related knowledge, leadership experience, and
  Googleyness (a unique blend of ambition, team orientation, bias to action,
  creativity, and integrity).


  More important than the specific criteria is the willingness to put the time
  and effort required into hiring. They would rather their hiring process
  generate more false negatives than false positives — meaning they are willing
  be patient and cut ruthlessly when people aren’t a perfect fit.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book is an incredible opportunity to learn from two of the best in the
  world at what they do. If you’re a startup founder, or anyone managing other
  people, looking to design systems to allow your employees to succeed without
  you peeking over their shoulders, this book will completely change the way you
  work. I can’t recommend it enough.

> "The plan for creating that great search engine, and all the other great services, was equally simple: Hire as many talented software engineers as possible and give them freedom." _\- How Google Works, page 5_

Google has created a culture that’s the envy of a lot of the business world. _How Google Works_ is a peek behind the curtain. Former CEO Eric Schmidt and SVP of Product Jonathan Rosenberg spill the beans on everything from office setup, to hiring, to leadership.

I can honestly say this is the most I’ve ever highlighted a book. There’s such a high density of ideas that it’s difficult to summarize, but I’ll do my best…
