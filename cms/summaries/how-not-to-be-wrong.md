  ### What assumptions are you making?


  > "A mathematician is always asking ‘what assumptions are you making? Are they
  justified?’ This can be annoying. But it can also be very productive.\`"- How
  Not to Be Wrong, page 7


  Through all the examples, studies, theories, quotes, and lessons graciously
  shared by Ellenberg, the most fundamental point being driven home is around
  being a better critical thinker. The book is a continuum of examples that bake
  mathematical theory into everyday assumptions like headlines, studies, myths,
  gambling, religion (yup he goes there!) and everything in between. Within
  every story the protagonist is the principle, which for the most part are
  easily understood, who wins every time because they went just that much
  further to think about it a new way, ask a better question, or clarify what it
  is we are really getting at here. In the age of information overload, big
  data, and the reliance on computers and one of my closest friends, Excel, it
  is easy to forget what it is we are saying or understanding and whether it
  actually makes sense. The Insights below are some of my personal favourites
  that demonstrate how digging into what assumptions are we making—and if they
  are justified—can provide you an outcome you may otherwise not have
  considered.

  This last insight was a humbling read for me. The author builds into the
  concept of linear regression (think any simple line graph trending in a
  certain direction). He uses an example of a study out of the US that claims
  that by 2048 all Americans will be obese. Some of us have probably seen this
  or similar headlines through many different media outlets. Now let’s consider
  our assumptions and if they are justified. Continue this trend and by 2060 a
  cool 109% of Americans will be obese. Wait, what? At some point your
  proportion needs to actually start to bend before 100%. Why? Because when you
  really think about it (mathematician or not)–is it actually a good assumption
  to say that 100% of the United States will be obese? The paper further dives
  deeper into the population statistics by sex and gender and informs us that
  100% of black men will be obese in 2095. Double take. How does that happen
  when 100% of the population is already obese by 2048? The paper doesn’t
  acknowledge the mathematical contradiction and we are now left feeling like
  we’ve been let down by our statistical best friend (and you have). I am not
  suggesting (nor is the author) that linear regression is bad (phew), but let’s
  use this as a friendly reminder about the stories we plan to tell with it.
  What are you assuming? Is it justified?

  ### Sorry, Dwayne Wade. There is no such thing as a “hot hand” in basketball.

  to overestimate their strength where they do."- How Not to Be Wrong, page 129


  At the time of this summary the Toronto Raptors are tied in the second round
  of the NBA playoffs against the Miami Heat. Our nemesis seems to be Dwayne
  Wade, who most fans would agree in this series appears to not be able to miss
  a shot. Naturally my interest was piqued when the author dedicated a few pages
  to dispelling this myth. There are a number of mathematical principles at play
  here. One being in statistical studies, the phenomenon of an expected size can
  be underpowered. Think looking at the planets with binoculars instead of a
  telescope. This little theory reminds us that if we do some statistical
  sampling around what a hot hand might look like with some real data, there’s a
  chance that even if this “hot hand” is happening our method may not even allow
  us to detect it. There are multiple studies referenced that show the
  progression and refinement of disproving the hot hand myth. Not to leave you
  hanging, but essentially a 2009 study asserts that players who made a basket
  are more likely to take a more difficult shot next. Your basketballer friends
  will argue that they’ve seen this myth happen though! Wade can’t miss! He can,
  in fact he only made 13 of 24 field goal attempts in the last game. Stretch
  that over his 11 years in Miami and statistically speaking it will be
  challenging to find “hot hands”. So what are we taking away from this? The
  example here is a great reminder about how easily our assumptions can mislead
  us. You don’t even need to know the statistical theories mentioned, but have
  you considered the assumptions you are making? Are they justified?
f_conclusion: >-
  _How Not to be Wrong_ is a great tool for anyone who wants to become a better
  critical thinker, or perhaps has a staff member that could improve in this
  area. I love math and numbers and the legitimacy that it brings to a story.
  The author reminds us as good critical thinkers we need to be employing this
  method of reasoning to some degree or another. Perhaps even more importantly,
  consider how we are building this type of thinking within young people or our
  teams’ today–are we teaching them to consider their assumptions and if they
  are justified?

> "The mathematical ideas we want to address are ones that can be engaged with directly and profitably, whether your mathematical training stops at pre-algebra or extends much further." _\- How Not to Be Wrong, page 16_

Mathletes unite! _How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking_ is a powerful reminder that math concepts are the fundamental building blocks of critical thinking. Reflecting on my own profession (accounting) I think about what traits make CPAs desirable in the workforce and I would argue that critical thinking would rank high on that list. But what is it that really allows someone to build that skill? Let’s reach a bit deeper into the philosophical pool and reflect on the principles of how math is being taught in the classroom today. Are we creating critical thinkers or really good test writers? Jordan Ellenberg sets up this book to prove that it’s not about if you can solve or proof an equation but can you use basic principles to become more engaged and if I may be sold bold to say–smarter? I also must give credit to Ellenberg for making a very appropriate reference to _Mean Girls_.
