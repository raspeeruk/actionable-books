  ### See failure as a friend, not foe


  > "Failure is where success likes to hide in plain sight. Everything you want
  out of life is in that huge, bubbling vat of failure."- How to Fail at Almost
  Everything, page 16


  Through various topics including find a system, pare away all else except what
  energizes you, and strategically improve your odds against the elusive lady of
  luck, Scott Adams sets out a template for success that is only accessible if
  one cultivates a relationship with failure. He is quick to point out that
  while his book is not an advice book, he has gathered some experiential wisdom
  over the years as a ‘wanna be’ restaurateur, closet inventor, and a programmer
  geek of computer games. In fact, Mr. Adams encourages us to **“invite failure,
  survive it, and even appreciate it, because failure always brings something of
  value with it.”**

  ### Passion is overrated


  > "Energy is good. Passion is bull."- How to Fail at Almost Everything, page
  13


  When you are in the middle of that bubbling vat of failure it is hard to have
  passion about what you are doing. _No kidding._ Scott Adams suggests that it
  isn’t passion that is going to rescue you, but rather the choices you make
  that maximize your personal energy. His thinking here is that if you learn how
  to make the right choices (eating right, exercising, avoiding unnecessary
  stress, getting enough sleep etc.) to get your personal energy right then the
  quality of your work will be better, more creative, more efficient. **Energy
  like this has longevity whereas passion can be fleeting.**


  Mr. Adams says that we need to find something that completes this sentence:
  “The main reason I (insert your job/hobby) is because it energizes me.” If
  nothing comes to mind quickly, think about what gets you going in the morning.
  That thing that you do that you don’t need another reason to do it. Until you
  can answer this question you are not doing what you will be most successful
  at. In his words, “Let your ideas for the future fuel your energy today.”


  More than once the Dilbert creator warns us not to take advice from a
  cartoonist. But I would suggest that this cartoonist has some real truths for
  those looking to turn failure into success.

  ### You need a system


  > "Goals are for losers. Systems are for winners."- How to Fail at Almost
  Everything, page 32


  At first read you may react personally and wonder if the goal you are
  currently working towards means you are a loser! But if you stick with Scott
  Adam’s train of thought, you may come out feelings intact and with a new
  system.


  The author suggests that there is a hidden gem of wisdom in thinking about
  goals and systems as very different concepts. A goal, as he defines it, is a
  specific objective that you either achieve or don’t sometime in the future.
  **A system, in contrast, is something you do on regular basis that increases
  your odds of happiness in the long run and has no deadlines.** He goes on to
  share that because goals are a reach-it-and-be-done situation, they are often
  associated with frustration and a sense of failure if goals are not met. Or
  that once you meet your goal you stop moving. He proposes that the most
  successful people have a system that is always in motion. There may be hiccups
  along the way, but the system keeps on chugging along. **There is no
  complacency in a system.** You are always striving for something beyond where
  you find yourself today. Something better.

I have always been a Dilbert ™ fan. Maybe it’s because professionally I consort with HR professionals, being one myself. That evil HR Director makes me laugh out loud every time. So, when I had the chance to read Scott Adams latest book offering, _How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life,_ I grabbed it and didn’t look back.

Similar to his comic strip, Mr. Adams has written this book in a no-nonsense, straight to the point style, sprinkled with some Dilbertisms along the way. He finds the nugget of truth from his experiences of failure and shares them with us in a way we can relate to.

We get a hint from the book’s title as to what awaits us on the pages ahead—that **the reality of failure is an intrinsic part of a successful life.** Mr. Adams is as fluid with his words as he is with the pencil. In fact, he often uses street vernacular with utmost prowess, hitting the target every time. He gets our attention with his stories of being a miserable office drone turned syndicated comic strip author. You keep reading because you want to know how this is possible.
