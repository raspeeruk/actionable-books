  ### Creating is an ordinary act


  > "Creation is destination, the consequences of acts that appear
  inconsequential by themselves but that, when accumulated, change the world.
  Creating is an ordinary act, creation its extraordinary outcome."- How to Fly
  a Horse, page 23


  In Ashton’s opinion, we misrepresent the entire process of creating if we
  overhype its extraordinary outcomes at the expense of those somewhat mundane
  steps that help us reach those destinations.


  We should create for creation’s sake, trusting that our creations will have
  positive impacts, even if we can’t always predict them – and sometimes, even
  if our work doesn’t get the acclaim it deserves. Ashton relates the sobering
  story of Rosalind Franklin who discovered DNA, but failed to receive any
  credit from those who would go on to use her findings to win the Nobel Prize.


  We simply can’t know the “weight of our individual contributions.” And if we
  need to know that weight in advance, we will likely become frustrated.
  Although not referenced in the book, I’m reminded of John Berryman’s response
  to a fellow poet’s question about whether it’s possible to know if anything we
  write is any good: “You can’t. You die without knowing if anything you ever
  write is any good. If you have to know, don’t write.”

  ### You sell your soul when you waste your time


  > "Rejection educates. Failure teaches. Both hurt. Only distraction comforts.
  And of these, only distraction can lead to destruction."- How to Fly a Horse,
  page 90


  The delete key is clearly a rejection of what we just wrote and an admission
  of failure. But it’s not a waste of time. Just the opposite: It’s a step –
  perhaps only a small one – in the right direction because it teaches us what
  didn’t work and needs fixing.


  Distractions _are_ steps in the wrong direction. Right now for me it would be
  paying attention to the lyrics of that song playing in the next room. Or
  letting the barking dog outside command my attention. Or worrying that I
  haven’t stood up and stretched for forty-five minutes.


  According to Ashton, “the three most destructive words in the English language
  may be _before I begin_.” If we want to create, we must not let anything keep
  us from one more iteration of whatever it is we’re creating.


  Ashton adds a twist to the familiar legend of bluesman Robert Johnson who
  allegedly sold his soul to the devil in order to play guitar better than
  anyone ever had. According to Ashton, “you sell your soul when you waste your
  time.” And that’s exactly what Johnson refused to do: He didn’t hang out with
  friends, play cards or even mourn his recently deceased wife and child. He
  spent every waking moment perfecting his craft, which has led nearly every
  subsequent guitarist since to revere him.


  What am I trying to create right now? What are you? We could invest the next
  hour making it incrementally better, even if that means crumpling up 99
  percent of our work-to-date and starting over. Or we could watch a reality TV
  show. The choice is ours.

  ### Love the delete key (literally and metaphorically)


  > "When we envy the perfect creations of others, what we do not see, what we
  by definition cannot see, and what we may also forget when we look back at
  successful creations of our own, is everything that got thrown away, that
  failed, that didn’t make the cut… The trash is not failure but foundation, and
  the perfect page is its progeny."- How to Fly a Horse, page 188


  Ashton believes creativity is more evenly distributed than most realize.
  Everyone can do it. Everyone should do it. And with apologies to Nike, all of
  us really should “just do it.”


  While certainly not as pithy, perhaps a more apt expression for the creative
  act might be “just do it – then undo and redo it again and again and again.”
  According to Ashton, your first start is almost certainly bad, but no worse
  than the first starts of others.


  In one anecdote, Ashton shares how Stephen King will “throw away more than
  three hundred single-spaced typewritten pages, about sixty thousand words,
  which will have taken him more than a month to write, if he feels they are not
  good enough.”


  In another, he shares how Stephen Wolfram – in an amazing display of
  quantifying one’s self – recorded every keystroke he made between 2002 and
  2012 only to discover that “he hit delete more than seven million times,
  erasing seven of every hundred characters he typed, a year and a half of
  writing.”


  I’d love to know how many times I’ve hit the delete key while writing this
  summary (and, yes, one might legitimately argue not enough).

  "The creativity myth implies that few people can be creative, that any
  successful creator will experience dramatic flashes of insight, and that
  creating is more like magic than work. A rare few have what it takes, and for
  them it comes easy. Anybody else’s creative efforts are doomed. ‘How to Fly a
  Horse’ is about why the myth is wrong."

> "The creativity myth implies that few people can be creative, that any successful creator will experience dramatic flashes of insight, and that creating is more like magic than work. A rare few have what it takes, and for them it comes easy. Anybody else’s creative efforts are doomed. ‘How to Fly a Horse’ is about why the myth is wrong." _\- How to Fly a Horse, page xv_

It’s not easy to debunk a myth as pervasive as that of the “creative genius.” In _How to Fly a Horse_, Kevin Ashton not only welcomes the challenge, he makes a compelling case that creation, invention and discovery is everyone’s true work, not the province of a select few who somehow possess mystical powers and insights.

He punctuates his points in a freewheeling, highly entertaining way. From Bert and Ernie to the discovery of DNA, from _South Park_ to the stealth bomber, from the bacterium _H. pylori_ to Woody Allen’s _Annie Hall_, his “secret history” covers so much ground it’s dizzying – in a very good way.

But he does more than merely support his thesis with intriguing examples. He uses them to encourage us to work tirelessly, shunning any distractions that keep us from the incremental progress that must be made if the world is to benefit from the next big thing.

Since my creative activity of choice is writing, this summary tends toward those examples. However, the actionable steps apply equally to scientists, musicians, sculptors or whatever _you’re_ trying to create, invent or discover.
