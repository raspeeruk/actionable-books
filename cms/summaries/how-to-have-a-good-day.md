  ### Activate the Deliberate System


  > "Less of the day seems driven by chance once we understand some of the
  forces that shape our choices and our emotions, and once we recognize how our
  thought patterns can affect everything from our perception of reality to the
  moods of those around us."- How to Have a Good Day, page 3


  Just about everything that Webb shares in How to Have a Good Day is grounded
  in three essential scientific themes. These are: the two-system brain, the
  discover-defend axis and the mind-body loop.


  The two-system brain refers to our automatic and deliberate systems
  (Kahnemann’s System One and System Two for those who are familiar with
  [_Thinking Fast and
  Slow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/)).
  The automatic system “streamlines our decision making by nudging us toward
  whichever choice requires the smallest amount of conscious effort.” It guides
  us towards the (often erroneous) conclusion that the most obvious option is
  the best option. Engaging the deliberate system is critical—and underpins many
  of the suggestions outlined in this book.


  The discover-defend axis refers to the reality that even mild stress can push
  us into “defend” mode—and reduce the activity in our pre-frontal cortex, where
  the deliberate system’s work gets done. While we need the “defend” response to
  protect us from real harm, when it prevents us from thinking and behaving
  expansively—it isn’t serving us. Webb shares strategies for both tamping down
  the defend axis and activating the discover axis which loves (even small)
  rewards.


  Finally, Webb makes the case for remembering and using our bodies, not only
  our brains, to create good days. By paying attention to and caring for our
  bodies (exercise and sleep) and our minds (mindfulness, reflection) we can
  think better, live better and ultimately be happier.


  What follows are just a couple of gems from the book—specifically ones that
  I’ve adopted since starting the book which are helping me have even better
  days.

  ### Pose a Question


  > "How can we apply this to tricky tasks at work? It can be as simple as
  framing the task as an open question—simply pausing and asking, “What’s the
  right way to solve this, ideally?” When I feel frustrated by a lack of
  progress, I often find that’s enough to put me in a more exploratory
  mindset."- How to Have a Good Day, page 167


  Here’s a simple way to engage our “discover” axis and be more creative and
  expansive in our thinking—reframe your thinking into questions. Doing so
  results in a signal to your brain that you want it to explore and think new
  thoughts.


  We learn from a study of people working on anagrams that the group that wrote
  down the question “Will I solve these anagrams?” solved nearly twice as many
  puzzles as those who wrote down “I will solve these anagrams.” An easy,
  powerful shift.


  Remember Sheryl Sandberg’s question, “What would you do if you weren’t
  afraid?” It’s one of those questions I come back to again and again, because
  it helps kick me out of defensive mode and into expansive thinking. Research
  shows that we benefit from “rhetorical questions that invite us to set aside
  barriers that might be narrowing our thinking.” Other examples of questions
  like this include: “If you knew the answer, what would it be?” Or “If you had
  no constraints, what would you do?” Try this kind of question when you feel
  stuck and see if they can help you unstick.


  Also on the subject of questions: When we are asked a question rather than
  being told to do something, we feel more in control, less defensive and more
  open. So, notice when you are asking others vs. telling them and how you can
  shift to questions—of others and of yourself.

  ### Getting Our Priorities Straight


  > "We can’t switch off our automatic system’s filtering function—by
  definition, it’s automatic. But we can adjust the settings, by being more
  proactive in defining what our brain sees as “important” each day."- How to
  Have a Good Day, page 36


  I coach people on the importance of setting intentions and getting clear on
  priorities, yet often find myself feeling unclear about my own priorities. The
  suggestions Webb provides (a couple of which I include here) and the research
  she shares are helping me by making the process easier and by highlighting
  just how critical the activity of intention and priority setting is.


  Here are the four “As” that are outlined in the book, and that I’m now using,
  diligently, as I start my day (or if I get stuck in the middle of a day):


  **Aim:** What matters most and what does that mean my real priorities should
  be?


  **Attitude:** What concerns are dominating my thoughts? If they don’t help me
  with my priorities, can I choose to set them aside?


  **Assumptions**: What negative expectations do I have going into this? How
  might I challenge those expectations?


  **Attention:** Where do I most want to direct my attention? What do I want to
  be sure I notice?


  I’ll also sneak in an incredibly useful tip that I learned from Webb about
  managing to-do lists: Those long lists (that I am so very fond of) are not
  actually that helpful, within a given day. Instead, I review my big list the
  night before, identify what I am going to focus on the next day, and put that
  into a separate, much shorter, list. Throughout the day, I only work with that
  shorter list. I am less overwhelmed and getting much more—and what really
  matters—done.

  If you’re looking for good, research-based, ideas about how to be more
  focused, more organized, prioritize better, manage your emotional state and
  work better with others, _How to Have a Good Day_ is a resource you’ll want to
  have on your shelf—and refer to often.

> “This book is dedicated to translating the most valuable research into the context of today’s working world—the tough assignments, the packed schedules, the complex relationships—to show you how to make every day reliably more enjoyable and productive.” _\- How to Have a Good Day, page 12_

Caroline Webb’s _How to Have a Good Day_ is possibly the most actionable book I’ve read. It is packed with practical suggestions—all of them grounded in research in psychology, behavioral economics and neuroscience. What’s especially impressive is how many of the suggestions can be quickly implemented and easily sustained (I know this because I’ve adopted a few of them since starting to read the book). Webb also helps us understand why some of the things we already do work—increasing our motivation to continue to do them.

This book is not only about being productive, it is also about creating days (and by extension, lives) that are meaningful. Days where we get stuff done, and in which we feel good about what we do, how we do it, and how we interact with the people around us.

Webb shares the results (and often the fascinating details) of dozens of studies—helping us to understand the why of the suggested behaviors and practices she offers up.

And, one more suggestion: take the appendices seriously. They pull together many of the individual pieces and help you organize the many ideas here into a usable “plan.” As I was finishing the book and was feeling overwhelmed by the scope, I truly appreciated these guides.

Happy reading—and to great days ahead!
