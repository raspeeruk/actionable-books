  ### 3 Buckets


  > "A good life is not a place at which you arrive, it is a lens through which
  you see and create your world."- How To Have A Good Life, page 231


  Over the years of studying how to create a good life, Fields noticed something
  profound began to emerge: a simple model he calls the Good Life Buckets. This
  framework allows you to quickly and easily assess what’s working and what’s
  not in your life and instantly know where to focus your energy and what to do
  to make things better.


  Fields encourages us to think of our life as three buckets.


  1.  Vitality – an optimal state of mind and body. You simply cannot feel
  alive, happy and joyful when your body is abandoning you

  2.  Connection – about nourishing relationships

  3.  Contribution – about how you bring your gifts to the world to make a
  difference


  Simply put, the fuller your buckets, the better your life. How full are yours?
  To find out, you can complete a [60-second snapshot
  worksheet](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/bookinsider/60-Second-Snapshot-Worksheet.pdf).


  Of course, the buckets are all connected. The 3 laws of the buckets are:


  1.  The buckets leak

  2.  Your emptiest bucket will drag the others down with it

  3.  The buckets never lie

  ### Spark yourself


  > "What if it isn’t so much about having to find that ever-elusive solitary
  passion or purpose, but rather finding a way to spark your interest in
  something that increasingly pulls you from ahead, the deeper you wade into
  it?"- How To Live A Good Life, page 163


  So how do you spark yourself? Below are 5 ideas to help.


  1.  **Curiosity** sparks – do you have a burning question, a deep yearning to
  discover and answer a problem, or do you feel compelled to solve something?

  2.  **Fascination** sparks – is there a topic or idea that triggers an
  intrinsic desire to learn? You don’t want to answer anything in particular,
  you just feel like you are wired to be interested in this topic.

  3.  **Immersion** sparks – are there activities in which you lose yourself?
  You lose track of time and would even pay to do more?

  4.  **Mastery** sparks – is there something you would work fiercely at because
  you want to be really good at it –even world class?

  5.  **Service** sparks – is there a person, group, cause that you feel
  compelled to help?


  It’s okay if no single spark ever rises to an all-consuming mad passion or
  life purpose. The important thing is simply to recognize the spark, the
  interest, the curiosity and then lean into it. The mix of what sparks you may
  stay consistent throughout life or it may evolve as you move through different
  seasons of your life. And now for the action; how can you weave more of the
  things that spark you into your days?

  ### Curiosity may have killed the cat, but it will light up your life!


  > "Curiosity, she realized, is not only a more realistic predictor of a life
  well lived, but also a much more forgiving and helpful guide."- How To Have A
  Good Life, page 162


  What’s your passion? Don’t you hate that question? People are told that to
  find happiness, they need to find their passion. What if it was reversed? What
  if instead of having a passion or purpose, you pursued things _with_ passion
  and a sense of purpose?


  What if the questions instead were:


  *   “What are you interested in?” or even “What are you curious about?”

  *   “What’s fascinating to you?” or even “What have you read/seen/heard that
  you want to know more about?”

  *   “What are you working toward that you desperately want to achieve?”

  *   “Who do you love to help, or serve or lift up?”


  So maybe, instead of having a purpose, you find a way to spark your interest
  in something that increasingly pulls you. And the deeper you get into that
  pursuit, the more competent you become with increasing passion and purpose.


  All that is required then to achieve this seemingly elusive passion is
  curiosity. Curiosity, is not just a helpful guide to a happy life but it has
  proven to be a more realistic predictor of a life well lived.


  I created and teach a program called **The Power of Purpose** in which we help
  pharmaceutical people connect with their purpose—the difference they can make
  for patients. The results are overwhelming. Those who explore this connection
  are not only happier than others, they also produce better outcomes!


  My own life is a case in point. A tragedy in my life; the death of my father
  from a prescribing error, pulled me to learn more about how to help
  pharmaceutical professionals influence healthcare professionals ethically and
  effectively. Pursuing my curiosity, I began to master the science of
  behavioral change; the psychology and adult education behind how to influence
  others. My desire to serve others and teach what I was discovering led to
  mastering the craft of teaching with passion and purpose.


  My small way of contributing to the world lights me up and fills me with joy
  and meaning. People are often confused when I bring “work books”, as my mother
  says, on vacation but following my curiosity lights me up! Interestingly,
  common characteristics people use to describe me are passionate and
  purpose-driven.


  Bottom line, put on your yellow hat and revel in being Curious George!

  The truth, Fields says, about the work to create a good life, is that it is
  never really done. Filling your buckets, living a good life is a constantly
  moving target. What one thing can you do today to fill a bucket?

What if 30 days from now you loved your life more?

Jonathan Fields started a Good Life Project on his mission to inspire possibility and answer the question, “What are the essential ingredients of a life well lived?” He traveled around the world, learning at the feet of the great thinkers of our time; from Buddhist Iamas to education reformers, and grounded theory researchers to neuroscientists. He found the intersection between science and spirituality to answer the question of how to live a good life.

Each chapter begins with an engaging story and lesson followed by application ideas. By the end of 30 days, you can be in a new place – living a better, more satisfying life. His book is a window into his seemingly simple yet transformational tool to guide your decisions and actions in the quest to live a great life.

This isn’t a book you just read. It’s more a book that you ‘do.’ Fields warns us early in the book that the real magic happens when you put down the book and start doing the work. He’s created a series of [online tools](http://www.jonathanfields.com/) that help you carry the learnings and doings into the rest of your life. The value that is packed into this book and online resources is incredible. Below are just three of the many gems I took from it.
