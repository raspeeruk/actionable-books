  ### Embrace Danger... Selectively


  > "If you really want to live your life to the full, and if you want to do and
  see and feel all that it has to offer, then you need to push at your fear, to
  see how far it will let you go, and when and why and how it will let you do
  what you want."- How to Live Dangerously, Part V


  Danger. What is the first image that comes to mind? You probably conjured up
  images of someone being reckless, or engaging in any activity that is the
  antithesis of safety. Being dangerous doesn’t mean you need to throw all
  caution to the wind. There are biological reasons for us to feel fear and they
  make sense. Fear helps us to learn to navigate danger, so that we can learn
  without getting into too much trouble. However, now our natural fear is often
  bombarded with the constant access to information that leads us to believe
  things are more dangerous than they appear. The author encourages us to “be
  dangerous” but to do so selectively, saying that we focus too much on the
  unimportant issues and obsessively fixate over the trivial and unlikely.


  Many of the things we perceive as “dangerous” are safer than we acknowledge.
  For example,


  there are only a handful of skydiving accidents every year, whereas there are
  thousands of fatal car wrecks. However, biologically we are wired to remember
  the sensational, the unique and gloss over the common place. That is why we
  remember 9/11 but the thousands that died in car wrecks yesterday barely
  register. We perceive more danger in jumping out of an airplane because, for
  most of us, it doesn’t happen frequently. Conversely, most of us travel some
  distance in a car every day and so the perceived danger lessens with time and
  exposure.


  A study in the UK found that the number of children killed in car accidents
  actually went up after a law required children to wear seat belts. “The reason
  for this was that people felt their children were now properly protected, so
  they didn’t have to worry so much, and so they could afford to drive faster
  and more recklessly.” Turns out we don’t understand danger as much as we think
  we do.


  Cairns says, “we ought to get out and live a bit more, and take a few more
  risks.” By learning to take certain risks he explains that we will live
  longer, happier, and safer lives.

  ### Worry Effectively


  > "That’s what we do, all of us: we irrationally overestimate the dangers of
  the strange, the shocking, the disproportionately visible. We worry too much
  about the things that grab our attention and churn up our emotions; and we
  don’t worry nearly enough about the quieter but equally real dangers that lie
  unremarked in the familiar things of life."- How to Live Dangerously, Part II


  I once heard that worrying is like a rocking chair, it gives you something to
  do, but it won’t get you anywhere. Despite the lack of evidence, we worry more
  today than ever before. The author explains that with our 24 hour news
  networks, “we feel fear when really we oughtn’t, and we imagine all sorts of
  terrors and perils lurking on every corner that either don’t exist at all or
  are about as likely to happen to you or to anyone you know as being struck
  down by a comet, or eaten by an escaped rhinoceros.”


  Instead you should worry about things that are dangerous to us individually,
  like your health and wellbeing, things like actively preventing heart disease,
  or cancer through daily decisions. This book presented a unique challenge to
  apply. It challenged my paradigm of what I think is dangerous and forced me to
  compare them to reality. I can’t say I’ve radically altered my daily
  activities. I still wear my helmet while riding my bike. I realized I spend
  too much time looking at a screen and not enough time being active. It is time
  I lived a little more dangerously.

  ### Create Shared Space


  > "...the most effective way to make a thing safer is to make it more
  dangerous."- How to Live Dangerously, Part V


  A dangerous road, ironically, can be the safest.


  If you have ever driven on icy winter roads you know that you slow down, you
  are more attentive to details and conditions that commonly don’t get
  acknowledged. Cairn explains that because you understand the conditions are
  abnormal you pay more attention which helps you to drive safer.


  Hans Monderman, a Dutch traffic engineer, took the increased attention
  principle to the extreme when he radically altered safety practices in his
  village. He removed all safety features. All of them. Everything that
  indicated what a driver was to do, indicating that each person, driver or
  pedestrian was responsible for their safety. He said, “When you don’t exactly
  know who has right of way, you tend to seek eye contact with other road users…
  You automatically reduce your speed, you have contact with other people and
  you take greater care.” In Drachten, a Dutch village entirely void of traffic
  signs handles 22,000 cars a day worth of traffic while producing a single
  digit accident rate. Monderman called his experiment “shared space” as it
  required all participants, motorized or not, to be more aware of their
  surroundings to ensure their safety.


  By empowering people to be more responsible for their safety, creating shared
  space, even the most dangerous of situations can be made safer.

> "The more we try to avoid danger, the more dangerous life becomes. And it’s not even very much fun, living like that. So, if avoiding danger doesn’t keep us safe, what does?" _\- How to Live Dangerously, Part V_

Are you safer riding your bike with or without a helmet? Do you run a greater risk of dying sky diving or driving your car to work? Is mountain biking a safer activity than gardening? You are safer riding a bike in an urban area without a helmet. You are more likely to die in a car wreck than throwing yourself out of a plane with billowing yards of fabric to stop you, and you will be safer rocketing around trails on a bike than rummaging among the dirt and seeds.

It seems a little counter intuitive doesn’t it? Don’t worry you are not alone in that conclusion. Warwick Cairns, a British author, explains in _How to Live Dangerously_ that as a society we misunderstand danger and risk. He believes that by correcting this misperception, by living a little more dangerously, we will not only enjoy life more, but will be safer in the process.
