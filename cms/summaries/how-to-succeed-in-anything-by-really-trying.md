  ### Not Your Standard Report Card


  > "...the three A’s of a career are Ability, Ambition, and Attitude. … ability
  earns you your paycheque, ambition gets you your raises, and attitude usually
  determines the amount of both."- How to Succeed in Anything by Really Trying,
  page 59


  How many ‘A’s are you currently earning?


  While MacInnis appears to meander from topic to unrelated topic over the
  course of the thirty-one chapters in _How to Succeed in Anything by Really
  Trying_, he manages to do an excellent job of covering off all three of the
  ‘A’s that he mentions: Ability, Ambition and Attitude. His reminders allow us
  to refocus. His tips and suggestions help us grow. And his insights allow us
  to realize that maybe not everything is as big a deal as it seems.

  ### The Fountain of Youth


  > "Become interested before becoming judgmental."- How to Succeed in Anything
  by Really Trying, page 54


  You ever notice how insatiably curious kids are? They want to know the why,
  how and what of everything. Kids are fascinated by the mundane. How is it that
  they can be so fascinated by those things that we, as adults, take for granted
  every day? The simple truth lies in the fact that a child is seeing each new
  sight with fresh eyes. He or she is experiencing each event for the first
  time.


  It’s easy to be fascinated by newness. It is as we age and “experience” that
  we lose our sense of curiosity. We build up expectations and prejudices from
  (what appear to be) similar past encounters. There is nothing wrong whatsoever
  with learning from experience. If you can suspend your opinion and your
  disbelief for a moment though, and take an approach of curiosity, if only for
  a few minutes, you might be surprised how refreshing a new set of eyes can be.

  ### Everything in Perspective


  > "Ask yourself how much whatever’s upsetting you will matter a year from
  now."- How to Succeed in Anything by Really Trying, page 47


  Great exercise: Take a deep breath. Count to ten. Then ask yourself this very
  simple question: “How much of an impact will this irritant have on my life a
  year from now?” If the answer really is “A ton! This could make or break me!”,
  then you need to find a way to fix the issue; calmly and rationally, but fix
  it none-the-less. Chances are though, if you’re like the rest of us, you’ll
  realize that this “major issue” that has you all worked up will have little to
  no impact on your life in the long run. Treat it appropriately.
f_conclusion: >-
  Author Lyman MacInnis has it figured out. _How to Succeed in Anything by
  Really Trying_, is a well written blend of gentle reminders, how to tips and
  poignant insights into what truly makes us successful in our day to day lives.
  It’s a fun read, with something for everyone, and the kind of book you’ll want
  to reference again and again.
