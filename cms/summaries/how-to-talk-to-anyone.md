  ### Superficial Actions Foster Deep Connections


  > "There are two kinds of people in this life: Those who walk into a room and
  say, ‘Well, here I am!’ And those who walk in and say ‘Ahh, there you are.’"-
  How to Talk to Anyone, opening


  Each of the ninety-two tricks presented covers a small, specific interaction
  with other people. Every time you communicate you’re making some kind of
  impression: good, bad or indifferent. Which impression do you want to make? By
  choosing to master ways of behaving and communicating, you have the
  opportunity to deepen your most important relationships, in every moment you
  share with others.


  Take Technique #37, for example: “Never the Naked Thank You.” This simple tip
  allows you to graciously thank someone in a way that will make them notice.
  The phrase “Thank You” is used so often that people often don’t hear it. To
  make them truly feel appreciated, simply add what you are thanking them for:
  “Thank you for your kind offer” or “Thank you for the compliment.”

  ### Friendly First Impressions


  > "You wouldn’t dream of going to a party naked. And I hope you wouldn’t dream
  of letting your conversation be exposed naked and defenseless against the two
  inevitable assaults ‘Where are you from?’ and ‘What do you do?’"- How to Talk
  to Anyone, page 63


  You’re about to introduce two single people at a party. They could be one
  another’s soulmate or new best friend. How do you get that initial
  conversation going so they can find out?


  Here’s how to make that introduction so it doesn’t fall flat. Technique #17:
  Never the Naked Introduction.


  When introducing people, include an interesting tidbit about each person. This
  gives the conversation a starting point. For example: “Chris, I’d like you to
  meet Nancy, who recently celebrated her birthday in Provence. Nancy, I’d like
  you to meet Chris. Chris helped build a school in Kenya last summer.” Now,
  Chris can ask Nancy if she speaks French and what she enjoyed about Provence.
  Nancy might ask Chris about his role in building the school and whether he has
  travelled elsewhere in Africa.


  During a conversation with a new friend, two questions often come up: “Where
  are you from?” and “What do you do?” Here’s the problem: the conversation can
  die if your acquaintance knows little about your hometown or occupation. To
  keep the conversation flowing, use Technique #15: Never the Naked City and
  Technique #16, Never the Naked Job. Add a fact or interesting description to
  each.


  Here are a couple of examples that I might use:


  “I’m from Wellington, New Zealand. Much of the work on Lord of the Rings was
  performed in Wellington.”


  “I’m a corporate trainer and I lead workshops in communication skills, helping
  people to avoid death by PowerPoint.”


  Use add-ons that most people can relate to and your conversation partner can
  pick it up from there.

  ### Network with Ease


  > "They say the pen is mightier than the sword. It is, but the tongue is even
  mightier than the pen."- How to Talk to Anyone, page 121


  Networking is a wonderful way to have fun, meet people and grow your business.
  However, making that initial connection can be tricky.


  A great tip for making it easy for others to strike up conversation is
  technique #12: Always Wear a Whatzit. What’s that, you say? A Whatzit is an
  unusual accessory that gives people an excuse to start talking to you. It
  could be a fun tie, an eye-catching pin or an interesting purse.


  If you’ve got no Whatzit and no-one to talk to, try using the Technique #14:
  Eavesdrop In. Stand near a group of people you’d like to join. Listen for a
  word or two that will give you a topic to comment on, then use it to join the
  conversation. For example: “I couldn’t help overhearing your discussion about
  yoga. I’m new to the city and would love to know where to find the best
  studios.” Though people may be taken aback momentarily, they will quickly
  forget if you use a warm smile and show genuine interest in the group and the
  topic.

  _How to Talk to Anyone_ contains so many valuable tips that I’ll be referring
  back to it for years to come. I will use it to refresh my skills and make it
  easy to meet people, keep the conversation going or show those that I love
  just how much I care.
