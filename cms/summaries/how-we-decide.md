  ### The Brain Is An Argument


  > "Even the most mundane choices emerge from a vigorous cortical debate."- How
  We Decide, page 199


  Your brain is like a couple kids fighting over who gets the window seat on a
  long drive. I’ll bet you keep giving the same kid the window seat and putting
  the other kid in the trunk.


  In our quest to be “logical” we give reason the window seat, and put emotions
  in the trunk. The answer, just as it is with kids on a long trip, is balance.


  Whether it’s Malcolm Gladwell’s _Blink_ or the work of Daniel Kahneman or Dan
  Pink ([_Drive_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/drive/), [_A Whole New
  Mind_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/a-whole-new-mind/)), we’re reading
  more and more about the balance of reason and intuition, logic and emotion, in
  decision-making.


  Take emotion and intuition out of the trunk. Look back at decisions you feel
  had poor results, and consider where your emotions might have served you
  better than analysis did. You know, those times when you just “had a feeling”
  but ignored it because you couldn’t explain it.


  Conversely, consider the times you didn’t have the time or inclination to
  invest in analysis, and simply chose―and felt like you’d won the lottery. In
  retrospect, note the very reasonable factors which, upon analysis, might have
  led you to choose differently―but not better.


  If your memory fails you, do this test going forward. Tune into your emotional
  intuitive decision-making ability. Recognizing that it exists is the first
  step toward training it as a powerful business and life tool.

  ### Think LESS About Those Items You Care A Lot About


  > "Instead of going with the option that feels best, a person starts going
  with the option that sounds the best, even if it's a very bad idea."- How We
  Decide, page 140


  Trivial decisions like which jam to put on your morning toast don’t deserve
  increased attention. It turns out that big decisions could also benefit from
  less attention. Less conscious attention, that is.


  A psychologist at the University of Amsterdam, Ap Dijksterhuis, conducted an
  experiment which showed that when presented with a small number of variables,
  logic yielded better decisions more often than intuition. When presented with
  a large number of variables (48 variables compared to 16 in the earlier
  experiment) intuition provided better decisions than taking time to fully
  analyze the options.


  In these circumstances, your unconscious can make better decisions than your
  conscious mind.


  Start small. Don’t experiment with your choice of a life partner or buying a
  house. Next time you need to make a decision you think you might struggle
  with, whether it’s which movie to see this weekend or whether or not to join
  that networking group, write each option on a slip of paper. Now, feed your
  brain 3 or 4 factors about each option, no more. Then sleep on it. Tomorrow,
  pull out the cards and just pick one. Don’t pause, analyze, or even think.
  Just read the two or three choices and pick one.


  Write down how you feel about it right now. Next week, write down how you feel
  about it after the fact.


  Train yourself to recognize your satisfaction level with your decisions, and
  you’ll train yourself to think less about the things you care about―and make
  better decisions in the process.

  ### You Know More Than You Know


  > "By looking at how dopamine works inside the brain, we can see why feelings
  are capable of providing deep insights."- How We Decide, page 35


  We’d all like to believe that mistakes are really “learning experiences.” For
  your unconscious, they are. Your unconscious has spent a lifetime gathering
  information, becoming expert in certain areas by learning from your mistakes.
  Your unconscious brain, if you’ll just stay out of its way, can process
  millions of bits of data simultaneously. Your conscious mind, on the other
  hand, can handle about a dozen… assuming you’re not distracted and that the
  bits are related to each other.


  You don’t even need the time to become expert for your unconscious to benefit.
  In one experiment outlined in _How We Decide_, subjects were given an
  imaginary budget and three decks of cards with financial rewards or
  punishments. They drew any cards they wanted, trying to end the game with as
  much money as possible.


  Since the decks were carefully prepared, drawing from two of them led to
  consistent wins. The third, though it had high payouts, carried extravagant
  punishments. The logical mathematical course was to avoid the dangerous deck.


  On average, people chose about 50 cards before they stopped drawing from the
  danger deck, and about 80 cards before they could explain why.


  Biochemical measurements revealed that, by the 10th card, their unconscious
  emotional responses to the danger deck were already evident. In effect, their
  emotions learned in 10 draws what it took their conscious mind eight times as
  long to learn.


  The difference, it turns out, is actually chemical. As your unconscious begins
  to identify patterns, your brain quickly adjusts the bursts of dopamine – a
  feel-good chemical – affecting the way you feel. Rewards become anticipation:
  your brain feels good even before you’ve made a good choice, or dumps you in
  the ditch in anticipation of the bad choice you’re about to make.


  Consider your own experiences from your meditation under the The Big Idea. In
  your areas of greatest experience, pause when making decisions and consider
  your feelings. Don’t try to put them in words, other than “positive/good” or
  “negative/bad.”


  Take note of how often your gut feeling aligns with the decisions you end up
  making logically in this area of expertise. Awareness of your emotional
  response is vital to making use of it as a decision-making tool.

  marvelous tool. Books like _How We Decide_ provide insight that makes it

> "The first step to making better decisions is to . . . honestly assess our flaws and talents, our strengths and shortcomings." _\- How We Decide, page 259_

We’d all love to think that logic and reason are the foundation of our choices. Gotta keep those emotions in check when we’re making life’s big choices. After all, when we’re buying a house or car, choosing a life partner, deciding what to eat or whether or not to have children, we want to make the best choice possible. Pure logic, we assume, leads to the best choices.

We’re wrong.

_How We Decide_ uses the latest scientific research to explain brand new understanding about how our brain works. This information is vital to better decision making.
