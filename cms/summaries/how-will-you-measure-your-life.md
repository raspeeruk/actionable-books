  ### Your Strategy Is Not What You Say It Is


  > "Watch where your resources flow. If they’re not supporting the strategy
  you’ve decided upon, then you’re not implementing that strategy at all."- How
  Will You Measure Your Life?, page 62


  We all have dreams about our business and our life. We’ve all had cases where
  the day-to-day got in the way of the big picture of those dreams. Author
  Clayton Christensen eloquently makes the point that our best defense is to
  **ensure that the day-to-day is about those dreams** and that the dreams we’ve
  chosen, the big picture we’re painting, is what we really want.


  It’s common for a business to publicly state altruistic, politically correct
  goals, then give the lie to those statements by what it does. **How we
  allocate our resources determines whether or not we paint the big picture
  we’re dreaming.** We’re not the disingenuous type to put on a false front for
  social expediency. But it’s human nature for us to allow the day-to-day to get
  in the way of the long-term, to give our time to whomever screams loudest, and
  energy to what provides the quickest return on our investment.


  The best defense is to **verify** that how we allocate our resources is
  consistent with our goals.


  Write a paragraph outlining the big picture of your life and business. Then,
  for the next two weeks, track where you invest time, energy, attention, or any
  resources that matter. Then **objectively assess whether you are allocating
  resources in alignment with your goals.** Be scrupulously honest with
  yourself. Where necessary, make adjustments.


  Just as a sailor constantly adjusts the trim of his boat’s sails to counteract
  the effects of wind and waves, this is not a set-it-and-forget-it task.
  Regularly revisit your resource allocation and avoid the pain of looking back
  over the years and discovering you’ve sailed a direction you never intended.

  ### Processes And Priorities Are More Valuable Than Resources


  > "These offer an accurate snapshot of a company at any given time, because
  they are mutually exclusive (a part of a business cannot fit into more than
  one of the categories) and are collectively exhaustive (together, the three
  categories account for everything inside of the business.)"- How Will You
  Measure Your Life?, page 124


  It’s easy and common to measure a business by the assets on the balance sheet.
  Christensen points out that your capabilities include more than resources.
  What you are capable of also includes your **processes** and your
  **priorities**.


  We all share the same pool of stuff, the resources in our businesses and often
  in our lives. **What we do with that stuff,** our process, is less common.


  Our priorities, a reflection of our core values, are **powerful and unique.**


  What processes make you stand out? Which don’t fit the big picture you’re
  painting? Where can you make use of another’s capabilities as a resource
  without surrendering process or priority?

  ### Balance Deliberate And Emergent Planning


  > "Managing this part of the strategy process is often the difference between
  success and failure for companies; it’s true for our careers, too."- How Will
  You Measure Your Life?, page 42


  Entrepreneurs love planning. We buy journals and software and set aside time
  on our schedule. We write outlines and draw diagrams. And we forget that this
  “planning stage” (aka the beginning) is **the time when we know least** about
  how a project will progress.


  Plan, absolutely. But knowing that plans can be derailed or discovered to be
  faulty, watch for emergent opportunities, the serendipity of what can’t be
  planned.


  Christensen discusses Frederick Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory. I’ve
  written about it at length
  [here](http://ezinearticles.com/?Satisfaction-in-the-Workplace---The-Bucket-and-the-Basket&id=3019963),
  but in short he teaches that satisfaction and dissatisfaction are not opposite
  ends of a continuum but are instead **different measures altogether.**


  Hygiene factors are those which **remove dissatisfaction.** When working
  conditions are safe, making them more safe has little or no effect. When we’re
  paid enough, the reality is that being paid more has no more effect than
  **pouring water into an already full bucket.** Hygiene factors remove
  dissatisfaction but they don’t create satisfaction.


  Motivation factors such as autonomy over our work and a real purpose are like
  **leaves piled into a basket.** Even after the basket is full they can be
  squished down and piled high. There’s always room for a little more in the
  motivation basket.


  Look at the progress of your deliberate plan. Are all the hygiene factors
  cared for? Does the current plan do everything necessary to remove
  dissatisfaction? Now, is your **satisfaction** basket filling? If not, watch
  closely for the emergent opportunities. Use the bucket and basket thinking to
  measure whether new opportunities are more likely to remove dissatisfaction or
  create satisfaction. Don’t make the mistake of treating the two as opposites
  on a single continuum.
f_conclusion: >-
  _How Will You Measure Your Life?_ is a simple book which asks a simple
  question to which I was sure I knew the answer. During the week I spent
  reading it, I realized time and again that I was allocating time and energy to
  things I knew weren’t aligned with my life but were instead reactions to the
  loudest voice and the quickest ROI. I’ve already made some changes and more
  are on the way.

_How Will You Measure Your Life_ extrapolates business and life lessons by combining these principles:

*   what gets **measured** improves
*   **hindsight** is easier but **foresight** is better
*   business and life often run parallel

The advice throughout the book focuses not on the minutiae but the big picture, teaching business lessons and applying them to life choices. The result is forceful in its **clarity** and **simplicity**.

You may know how you will measure your life. **Are you planning on looking back at the end, or looking forward from this moment?**
