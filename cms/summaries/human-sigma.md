  ### Pay Attention to the Vital Signs


  > "Employee engagement does have a direct and measurable relationship to and
  impact on customer engagement."- Human Sigma, page 201


  Throughout the book, Fleming and Asplund compare organizations to the human
  body. A healthy body requires all parts to work in coordination with each
  other – the brain tells the heart to pump blood, the lungs to pump air, the
  stomach to process food, etc. Similarly, a healthy organization requires
  collaboration and commitment to shared goals across departments and business
  units.


  In today’s service based economies, the two vital signs are **customer
  engagement** and **employee engagement**. _Human Sigma_provides convincing
  research that shows business units with high customer engagement and high
  employee engagement are 3.4 times more financially effective than those which
  ranked low on both levels. Furthermore, business units that had high customer
  engagement and low employee engagement (or vice versa) were only 1.7 more
  effective than those that ranked low on both levels.

  ### Think Globally, Measure and Act Locally


  > "Within the same airlines, some flights are never on time; some always are.
  Within the same retailer, one store delivers exceptional service; another
  struggles to drag customers through the door. Within the bank, some branches
  are exceptional places to work; others are awful."- Human Sigma, page 188


  We’ve all experienced this. We have a friend who works for a company ranked as
  one of Canada’s Top 100 Employers who hates it. We have a favourite dish at a
  restaurant chain that tastes differently at another location. Variability is a
  part of a service-oriented business, but reducing variability is key to
  winning the hearts of your customers.


  From a leadership perspective, it’s important to convey a consistent message
  and goal across all business units. However, when **measuring** for health,
  it’s important to drill down to the local business unit. Appraising a summary
  of customer satisfaction results for the entire organization won’t help you
  determine which particular branches are doing exceptionally poorly. Nor will
  it help you determine which branches are doing spectacularly; knowledge that
  would help you identify best practices and apply them to the low-performing
  branches. Think Globally. Measure (and Act) Locally.

  ### Measure Accurately and Act Accordingly


  > "Far too many companies treat their customer and employee metrics as ends
  unto themselves rather than as a means to a higher end."- Human Sigma, page
  224


  In typical organizations, Operations measures customer satisfaction, while
  Human Resources measures employee engagement. Unfortunately, in most
  organizations, these metrics are not shared between departments. This means
  that solutions meant to increase either or both are ineffective because the
  two are inextricably linked. Measuring the customer-employee interaction is
  critical to determining an organization’s health.


  You need to define the current and ideal benchmarks for customer satisfaction
  and employee engagement. You need to ask the right questions and obtain
  feedback (usually through both random and regular surveys) to determine what
  appropriate actions need to be taken. Depending on the results, it is
  important to probe the interactions more deeply. For example, if customer
  satisfaction is low, yet employee engagement is high, then perhaps you need to
  investigate the feedback or direction that employees are given, and whether it
  matches up to what it takes to provide excellent service.
f_conclusion: >-
  Although this book is geared towards senior leadership in large organizations,
  any organization that faces the challenge of satisfying customers and engaging
  employees will find the research useful. While, intuitively, we know that
  satisfied customers and engaged employees lead to successful companies, _Human
  Sigma_ provides real-life metrics and scientific studies that make the
  argument more compelling.

We’ve all heard of Six Sigma and how it has revolutionized the manufacturing process. But how does it fit into an increasingly service-based economy that we have today? The simple answer is that it doesn’t. Six Sigma deals with inputs like metal or glass that have predictable and consistent qualities. The inputs in a service economy are (gasp) humans – customers and employees who are unpredictable, unique, and even irrational sometimes. This is where _Human Sigma_ comes in.

John H. Fleming and Jim Asplund are Principals at top research firm Gallup. They explore the need to effectively measure and manage the employee-customer interaction in order for organizations to survive in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Based on research from 10 million employees and 10 million customers around the globe, the authors use compelling case studies and scientific evidence to prove that intangible assets (people) have a measurably significant impact on a company’s bottom line.
