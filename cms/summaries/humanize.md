  ### Command and Control is Over


  > "Social media . . . was born out of a culture that was almost diametrically
  opposed from command and control. Its basis of power is the distributed end
  user, \[not\] the centralized author of the software."- Humanize, page 71


  With distributed power in the hands of all users, interactions become
  one-to-one, not one-to-many. The same is true in organizations who want to
  thrive in the social media world – creating environments which are open and
  based on trust means not every tweet requires approval, and employees have
  much greater say in how their work is defined and implemented. The authors are
  careful to say that this isn’t a free-for-all – targets and metrics are still
  required – but the days of annual strategy meetings and power from the top
  need to be set aside in favour of dynamic organizational structures, perpetual
  planning and greater involvement from employees in defining how work is done.


  _“We need to create organizations that people are eager to join . . . where
  people will invest the same kind of energy, time and passion, quite frankly,
  that they put into interacting through social media.”_


  So where do we begin? How do we tackle this daunting prospect of completely
  revolutionizing the way we work?

  ### Be Open, Trustworthy, Generative, and Courageous


  > "Organizations need candour the way the heart needs oxygen."- Warren Bennis,
  quoted in Humanize, page 167


  Being open, trustworthy, generative (or capable for perpetual production) and
  courageous – these elements are chosen by the authors as critical components
  for social leaders because they believe they are the highest aspirational
  components of what it means to be human, as well as being _“at the heart of
  the unbelievable growth of social media.”_


  These four tenants are further defined by the authors in their “Trellis for
  Humanizing


  Organizations”, which are then applied across culture, process and
  organizational behaviours.


  The four elements translate into specific changes within organizations. For
  example, the authors talk about increasing access to information through data
  sharing and strategic conversations at all levels, as well as moving to
  dynamic, perpetual planning cycles, with processes that have broader employee
  input. The authors encourage us to be transparent in how these ideas are
  developed and incorporated into project plans for implementation. Employees
  don’t expect every idea to be implemented, but want to understand and
  influence how those decisions are made.


  The book also discusses the importance of building true learning organizations
  – where personal growth and development is expected and nurtured, again where
  failure is acknowledged and openly discussed, both in terms of encouraging
  risk taking as well as making iterative changes to enhance the organization
  and its outcomes.

  ### Allow Leaders to Be Human


  > "Social media is teaching us that building relationships means sharing some
  of our true selves."- Humanize, page 112


  Past models of leadership encourage leaders to be inspirational, but many have
  interpreted this as a need to convey almost unrealistic images of power,
  strength and invincibility. Organizations would be far better off being able
  to openly talk about failure and how to recover from it, than trying to
  maintain a perfect front.


  Social leadership requires a willingness to be vulnerable, because taking
  risks involves failure, and learning from those failures can only happen if we
  openly acknowledge and discuss what happened.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are so many ideas from this book, and it would be impossible to
  summarize all of them here. The book is packed with examples of organizations
  and leaders who already “get it”, as well as links to checklists and referrals
  to other great books recommended by the authors.

We live in a social world, now even more so as a result of the dramatic increase in social media. Technology has changed every aspect of our lives, and yet we continue to work in organizations with processes and policies that have not changed in decades. The authors of the book _Humanize_, Jamie Notter and Maddie Grant, argue convincingly that organizations must completely redesign the way they operate, so the social way they connect externally with their customers is aligned with how they connect internally with their employees as well.

_“…until we understand how our organizational cultures are often incompatible with the principles behind social media, we are destined for failure.”_

I believe many organizations are trying to figure out how to treat employees as people, not simply as other capitalized commodities, but it will be a long process unless passionate individuals at all levels lead the way. Organizations need to move beyond treating employees as “human resources” and instead, treat them as people. I’m not sure the term HR will be able to survive long-term, and certainly not in its current form. Dramatic changes are needed there too if organizations truly want to embrace the human elements of being social.

Organizations have talked about the need to improve employee engagement for years. _Humanize_ shows us that the rules of engagement have changed, and we need to use the lessons learned from social media to finally create organizations that inspire us and engage us as human beings.
