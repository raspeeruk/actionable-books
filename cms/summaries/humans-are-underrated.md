  ### Social sensitivity is becoming our most valued commodity


  > "As the two large technology trends of our era combine, as technology takes
  over more of our work while simultaneously changing us and the way we relate
  to one another, the people who master the human abilities that are fading all
  around us will be the most valuable people in the world."- Humans are
  Underrated, page 67


  In our changing world, we increasingly rely on computers to retrieve facts,
  make calculations and perform tasks. Sometimes we still insist on human
  interaction. Our brains are hardwired to relate to people, and we need to feel
  understood—a computer does not empathize. We still need human creativity. As
  things change, we often don’t know what the problem is, and without a defined
  problem people must innovate to define both problems and solutions. Human
  abilities are indispensable.


  Technology has become ubiquitous in the workplace. Physical and mental work is
  rapidly being done more productively by computers. Not only can computers
  replace factory workers and office workers, in some cases, they can replace
  doctors and lawyers, and even self-driving trucks can replace truck drivers.
  Our work is evolving to become less routine and repetitive, menial jobs are
  disappearing, and the complex social interactions the human brain evolved to
  perform, the attributes that caused the human race to flourish, are a
  significant advantage.


  As technology expands, it becomes efficient to connect remotely. There are
  countless examples; we have more opportunities to work from home, we choose to
  connect with a computer instead of a person, we send texts instead of calling.
  It is efficient, but our brains evolved to function best in face-to-face
  interaction. We may seem vulnerable in a personal encounter, but an electronic
  connection may feel like there was no connection at all. Worse is that our
  human skills atrophy and our ability to sense the emotions, motives, fears,
  and needs of others, fades. Those with strong ability to empathize become less
  common and more valuable in the workplace.

  ### Win with self-motivation and focus on others


  > "In their lab experiments and studies of organizations, people who are
  other-focused as well as intrinsically motivated produce the most creative and
  useful ideas. Being other-focused means having a prosocial orientation, a
  fundamental wish to help others. It’s not surprising people with those traits
  come up with ideas that will be useful to others, and when combined with
  intrinsic motivation, it’s a winning package."- Humans are Underrated, page
  175


  To be intrinsically motivated we need to be engaged in the work we do. Much of
  the work we have done for more than 100 years has involved acquiring knowledge
  or skills and honing them to do the same thing accurately and repetitively. I
  think it is wonderful we can give that up to computers. It is hard to stay
  engaged in mundane work when our brains have evolved to thrive when we engage
  with others, share ideas, and explore. The task then becomes to seek what
  genuinely interests us.


  A prosocial orientation means we can empathize with others. When we listen to
  and understand the thoughts and feelings of others and respond with comfort,
  support, and truth, it creates a bond of trust. Others have a reciprocal
  response, and you learn to understand one another and communicate. Our ideas
  mingle, and the most useful solutions materialize. When we combine our inborn
  drive and focus on how we can benefit others, there is a synergy, and our work
  achieves its highest value.

  ### Teams thrive working face-to-face


  > "The world is doing ever more of its work in teams, and we humans have been
  exquisitely fine-tuned over the millennia to work together in this way. … We
  form, exchange, improve, accept, and reject ideas, and we improve our
  collective performance, through deeply human processes that may happen without
  our even knowing it."- Humans are Underrated, page 140


  Humans evolved in groups that benefit all members. Groups offered protection,
  pooling of resources, and efficiency in hunting and gathering. Effective group
  dynamics involve helping others, sharing knowledge, and making connections
  without expecting something in return. Our brains reward us with opioids when
  we work together, not for self-interest but the benefit of others. When we
  interact face-to-face our brains synchronize, but when we talk back to back
  they don’t. Companies that have ensured their employees have freedom to
  interact face-to-face have seen boosts in productivity.


  Teams that work face-to-face have a better understanding of each other and
  generate more diverse ideas. Creativity is at its peak in groups where people
  spend time both outside the group gathering ideas and inside the group
  exchanging ideas. The team needs to have a healthy trusting relationship to
  exchange ideas freely, and it is empathy that binds people and creates
  cohesive groups.


  When team members don’t work face-to-face, we lose the advantages that
  evolution gave us. Since technology has replaced more of our face-to-face
  interaction, narcissism has increased, and empathy has decreased. Narcissism
  creates a toxic work environment where people focus on personal gain and
  minimize their contributions. In this environment trust and creativity shut
  down, we compete against our teammates and the organization declines.
f_conclusion: >-
  We are all born with the ability to develop social sensitivity. It is a skill
  we can learn or learn to do better. Our jobs are changing; technology is
  replacing education and skilled labor. Humans still need to feel understood,
  and for some interactions we will only accept a person. Reliance on technology
  is reducing social connection. Those with prized social skills are becoming
  scarce, and in our transforming world, we need them. Those who have social
  expertise will become the most valued in the workplace and part of the most
  innovative teams and productive organizations. Their skills will be valued
  because they are uniquely human.

  “The new high-value skills are instead part of our deepest nature, the
  abilities that literally define us as humans: sensing the thoughts and
  feelings of others, working productively in groups, building relationships,
  solving problems together, expressing ourselves with greater power than logic
  can ever achieve.”

> “The new high-value skills are instead part of our deepest nature, the abilities that literally define us as humans: sensing the thoughts and feelings of others, working productively in groups, building relationships, solving problems together, expressing ourselves with greater power than logic can ever achieve.” _\- Humans are Underrated, page 4_

Over the last century, education has been the mainspring of flourishing economies. The knowledge worker was most valued. As technology becomes more powerful, computers can do many tasks previously done by knowledge workers more efficiently, and education is not as valued as it once was. The nature of our work is changing, and the skills the economy thrives on are changing. In _Humans are Underrated: What High Achievers Know that Brilliant Machines Never Will_, [Geoff Colvin](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/authors/geoff-colvin/) shows how social skills are becoming the most powerful force in business. The new relationship worker will be the most valuable asset in the new economy.
