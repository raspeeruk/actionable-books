  ### New As and Bs


  > "The reality is that truly creative solutions often begin by reimagining the
  problem or reframing the starting point and the end goal. True innovation
  isn't about finding an alternative that gets us from A to B; it's about
  envisaging new As and Bs. It's about being open to redefining where problems
  begin and where solutions must end and working out why it matters that we make
  these new connections or forge different paths."- Hunch, page 41


  What became abundantly clear to me as I read my way through _Hunch_ is that
  the cornerstone of every “big thing” is a solution to a problem—even if it’s
  one you didn’t know you had.


  Jiwa shares the inspiring story of Richard Turere, a boy from Kenya who had
  been tasked with the important responsibility of minding his family’s herd of
  cattle and protecting them from the lions which stalked the cowshed at night.
  He had a lightbulb moment when he realized that the lions would steer clear if
  they detected the presence of humans. The result was Lion Lights, which,
  through the movement of light, created that illusion. “Anyone could have done
  it,” Jiwa explains, “but it took a curious and determined eleven-year old boy
  to begin to solve a problem that a whole community and countless officials had
  wrestled with for years.”


  Another example that I love (but one that wasn’t included in the book), is the
  backstory behind the creation of YouTube. One of the founders of the popular
  video-sharing website was dismayed when he was unable to locate the clip of
  Janet Jackson’s infamous wardrobe malfunction during the 2004 SuperBowl
  half-time show. While videos had been posted online for years at that point,
  there was never a dedicated platform where users could conveniently upload
  them in one spot. YouTube has since left an indelible mark on our culture, and
  odds are good that you’ve fallen down the YouTube rabbit hole once or twice in
  the last week alone.


  So, where do ideas begin? Jiwa cites social psychologist Graham Wallace, who
  believed that the creative process is comprised of four stages:


  1.  **_Preparation: start with the question._** _Begin with a question to
  answer, a problem to solve or an opportunity to realize. Research and gather
  the information and context._

  2.  **_Incubation: look for answers._** _Contemplate the problem and challenge
  assumptions. This stage is both conscious and unconscious, informed by what
  you know, questioning what you don’t know but believe to be true, and by your
  skills and expertise._

  3.  **_Illumination: find solutions._** _Generate insights that give birth to
  ideas about how the problem will be solved or the opportunity realized._

  4.  **_Verification: try and test._** _Execute your idea and test to see if it
  works._

  ### Ideas vs. Opportunities


  > "There's a subtle difference between ideas and what makes them
  opportunities."- Hunch, page 52


  What separates an idea from an opportunity is, as Jiwa says, subtle, but
  there’s a very important distinction. She defines the two this way:


  IDEAS = SOLUTIONS IN SEARCH OF PROBLEMS


  OPPORTUNITIES = PROBLEMS BEGGING FOR A SOLUTION


  Jiwa offers two examples to illustrate the difference between an idea and an
  opportunity. Firmly in the idea category is the Segway. Do you remember those?
  The Segway is a self-balancing “two-wheeled, battery powered vehicle” that hit
  the market in 2001. They never became the next big thing and Jiwa explains
  why: “Without a clear target market, or adequate consideration about the
  context in which the Segway would be used… it failed to become widely accepted
  and adopted by consumers.”


  The shopping cart, on the other hand, is a brilliant example of an
  opportunity. Sylvan Goldman, owner of the Humpty Dumpty chain of American
  supermarkets, discerned that the majority of shoppers would bring their
  selections to the checkout as soon as the basket was full or became too heavy
  to carry. To encourage his customers to shop more, he enlarged the basket and
  put four wheels on the bottom and voila, the prototype of the shopping cart as
  we know it was born. So, the next time you’re navigating the aisles of your
  local supermarket with ease, you can thank Sylvan Goldman—or curse him for the
  extra space the cart affords for that box of cookies.


  For your “hunch” to truly succeed and endure, and not just become another
  flash in the pan that will be quickly consigned to oblivion, you need to offer
  something tangible–an opportunity that is more than a mere idea.

  ### Evaluate Your Ideas


  > "In our 'think tank' and start-up culture, the importance we place on simply
  having ideas is overrated. Our energies would be better directed towards
  improving and evaluating the quality of our ideas before we begin to execute
  them."- Hunch, page 27


  Once you’ve come up with your unique idea, Jiwa offers six steps to help you
  “evaluate and improve” them:


  1.  _FOCUS: Prioritize undistracted thinking time._

  2.  _NOTICE: Practice paying attention to behaviors, patterns and anomalies._

  3.  _QUESTION: Get into the habit of questioning._

  4.  _DISCERN: Determine which ideas might be worth pursuing first._

  5.  _PREDICT: Translate insight into foresight._

  6.  _TRY AND TEST: Get feedback by testing._


  Deep thought is a skill that we need to hone to the extent that it becomes
  second nature. This can seem almost insurmountable in our world of almost 24/7
  connectivity, but if you’re intentional about it you’ll achieve great success.

  “There are hundreds of books that can help you with the process of making
  ideas happen,” Bernadette Jiwa acknowledges. “This is the one you need before
  you get to the execution stage.” Filled with fascinating case studies and
  action steps to help you strengthen your intuition muscle, _Hunch_ is an
  invaluable tome for equipping you with the tools to help you come up with the
  next big thing that’s going to rock our world.

> "\[‘Hunch’ tells the story of\] those successful entrepreneurs, creatives and innovators—people just like you—who have harnessed their curiosity, empathy and imagination, seeking out opportunities to invent, create and serve." _\- Hunch, page 13_

Through her illustrious career, and as the bestselling author of several books, Bernadette Jiwa has helped brands employ the power of storytelling to communicate their message. Now, with _Hunch: Turn Your Everyday Insights Into the Next Big Thing_, she has turned her focus to the power of cultivating your intuition. “Through my work and previous books, I’ve taken people on a journey that leads them from telling the story of their ideas to understanding what makes ideas fly. This book goes one step further. It tells the story of people who have practiced using what they know and questioning what they don’t.”

Jiwa contends that the brightest ideas are often borne out of intuition rather than analyzing hard data, corporate brainstorming sessions, or customer focus groups, and that great ideas are rarely, if ever, stumbled upon. Instagram. Starbucks. The Dyson vacuum cleaner. None of these reinvented the wheel (contrary to popular belief, coffee and coffee shops _did_, in fact, exist prior to Starbucks). What they did, and did brilliantly, however, was to meet a need and fill a void.
