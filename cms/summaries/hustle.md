  ### Habits of Great Hustlers—Make Your Future POP


  > "80 percent of success is showing up…if you embrace ‘jack of all trades and
  master of none’ as a compliment and learn more than one of these skills…you
  win."- Hustle, page 139


  The POP is your “Personal Opportunity Portfolio.” In which **you** create your
  future. You create your opportunities. The authors offer the following
  questions to get you thinking about how to find meaning, money, and momentum
  through your hustle:


  Are you building on your potential through “experiments, storytelling,
  pitching, growth and innovation?” Are you building on your people by “helping,
  serving, and networking?” Are you building on your proof through
  “discoverability, reputation, track record of success, differentiation, quirks
  and luck?” Are you building on your projects with your “day job, side gig,
  value add, productivity and teamwork?”


  The authors outline the principles below to help you maximize your hustle, and
  establish your POP:


  **Potential Makes You Powerful**


  Get out there and interact with people—tell stories. You are not going to be
  great—at the beginning. You just need to pitch the idea, the project, the
  work, the product and on average—if you have a level of better-than-average
  persuasion skills—you will find your momentum to show your meaning and make
  money to fuel your muse.


  **People Make Your Hustle Whole**


  Great structure for building relationships starts with a habit. You can employ
  the following tactics to maximize your relationships: seek out introductions
  to new people, use storytelling for a broad group of worldviews, recognize
  opportunities for collaboration between others, find the good in different
  perspectives, introduce others when they might benefit from becoming
  associated, and forge connections for those with the same issues.


  **Projects Make You Stronger**


  This is the proof and the production. You must be clear and set metrics:


  1.  Name your Project

  2.  Clarify a Goal

  3.  Set a Deadline

  4.  Figure out a list of collaborators.

  5.  Determine the pieces. What work needs to be done?

  6.  Who will do which parts?

  7.  Prioritize which pieces come first.

  8.  Execute through problem-solving by creative means with measurable results.


  **Proof Makes You Bulletproof**


  Visible production is the new normal—while resumes increasingly become a waste
  of time and paper. What have you done? If you haven’t created any work, then
  shots will be fired and nothing is going to stop the bullets (figurative of
  course) from poking holes in your façade.


  **Money: The Means of Momentum**


  “Financial success is what allows us to remain uncompromising in our art and
  our career.” You need a balance of money and meaning in order to survive, do
  great work, and create change while providing for your family.


  **Definite Meaning**


  There is no meaning without others. You need to approach each “situation and
  interaction with kindness, support, and openness, as if it will have a
  positive, mutually beneficial outcome” for all parties involved.

  ### Embrace Mental Exercise


  > "The more we practice our new modes of expression, the more we might be able
  to bolster our neurological health and recovery and delay the onset of
  traumatic brain diseases like Alzheimer’s."- Hustle, page 55


  “Too little exercise and we don’t grow.” The exercise the authors refer to is
  not just physical. Each part of what makes you who you are is driven by
  exercise, i.e., physical, mental, intellectual and spiritual. We need to
  continue to exercise our brains because growth will only occur when “we engage
  in cognitive activities.”


  Unfortunately, we often seek out experiences that involve little to no
  cognitive effort. Television is a dopamine driven instrument that creates a
  numbing effect. This numbing effect inhibits our cognitive exercise.


  To combat this effect, seek out challenging experiences. Do cognitive
  exercises, read deeply (either fiction or nonfiction), and engage in debates
  with people who have different beliefs than you. Embracing mental exercise
  will keep you sharp as you work through mistakes, strengthen your
  relationships, and maximize your hustle.

  ### Heart: Make 10,000 Mistakes


  > "Most people think they know what they’re good at. They are usually wrong.
  More often, people know what they’re not good at – and even then more people
  are wrong than right."- Peter F. Drucker, Hustle, page 29


  Success is the product of hustle, luck, and your unique talents. You probably
  noticed that I didn’t write 10,000 _hours_, I wrote, 10,000 _mistakes_. This
  is because we all know that hard work will help you with your goals, but that
  is not the only ingredient for success. You need to highlight your unique
  talents and experience in order to be successful. A crucial elements of
  developing that experience is your ability to embrace and learn from failure.


  The saying goes, “home is where the heart is,” and your heart will drive the
  10,000 _mistakes_ into something successful. By embracing your past mistakes,
  you will be able to assert your unique perspective, and demonstrate your
  ability to hustle. Simply putting in time will not be enough, you must be
  constantly challenging yourself to learn and grow.

  “Owning your dreams feels different, perhaps even strange. It involves living
  an engaged life; making your best, most decisive choices; not being afraid of
  the consequences, and correcting your course along the way. It means taking
  action and assuming rightful ownership of your destiny.”

Neil Patel, Patrick Vlaskovits, and Jonas Koffler’s book _Hustle: The Power to Charge Your Life with Money, Meaning and Momentum_ is both motivational and practical. The authors are great at telling stories, and developed each section of the book to find you directly where you currently are in your work and life.

The book focuses on a few different things: first, meaning, money, and momentum. These are the external characteristics that are crucial for your hustle. The authors then focus on your character—who you are internally, broken down into your heart, head, and habits.

_Hustle_ interweaves the internal and external characteristics to help you through your journey. The authors are consistently pushing for you to move quickly and make a difference. At the end of each chapter they review what you have learned, and challenge you to put those ideas into practice.

### Embrace Mental Exercise

_“A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.” ~ James P. Carse, Hustle, page 211_

Putting all of the lessons in this book into practice will not give you overnight success. This is a lifelong journey that may come with a lot of pain: but, it’s important to remember that in this context, pain can be good. A degree of pain lets us know that the mistakes are happening, and we are growing as we learn from challenges. In addition, hopefully, we are connecting with people who have the same dreams and ambitions that we have, to make our hustle all the more worthwhile. Remember, when the finite game comes to an end, we still need to recognize that there is only one infinite game. That game is always being played; “there is no end and no beginning. The rules are fluid, and if the rules threaten to make an infinite game finite, the players _must_ change them… the purpose is to keep playing.”
