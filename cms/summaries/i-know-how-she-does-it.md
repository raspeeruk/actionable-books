  ### Understand How You Actually Use Your Time


  > "Taking a clear look at work hours, and how much we can or want to work, is
  the first step to building a life that’s truly balanced, and moving forward on
  all fronts."- I Know How She Does It, page 31


  The basis of Vanderkam’s research for this book are time logs, where women
  kept track of their time in 30 minute increments. These logs are of course
  important for her research, but they have the added benefit of revealing to
  the person keeping them how their time is really used. From the research that
  she did for her first book _168 Hours_, Vanderkam knew that people tend to
  grossly misunderstand where their time is going. Typically, we tend to
  overestimate how much time we spend working and underestimate how much time we
  have for other activities.


  Once you have an understanding of how you actually use your time, and for that
  matter how much time you actually have, you can make more empowered decisions
  about how to use your time. I would also add that this knowledge can help you
  change your personal narrative about your time.

  ### Self-Care is the Secret Ingredient


  > "…taking care of yourself need not be a casualty of juggling work and
  life."- I Know How She Does It, page 200


  There seems to be a plethora of information and research these days that tells
  us just how important self-care is. This includes things like sleep, exercise,
  and other leisure activities. The challenge is that most of us assume that we
  don’t have time for these things, which Vanderkam overturns with her research
  and challenge to readers to keep a time log. Vanderkam’s research participants
  averaged over seven hours of sleep per night – significantly more than people
  often claim to be getting. Similarly, many of her participants were already
  exercising, or soon realized that they had time for it.


  One of the challenges that women often face when trying to make space for
  self-care is finding pockets of time for it. It often requires some amount of
  creativity. In [_The Fringe
  Hours_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-fringe-hours/) by
  Jessica N. Turner, Turner suggests looking for those smaller pockets of time
  (15 or 20 minutes), or other opportunities we may have to practice self-care.
  While finding the time might be the biggest challenge, I would add that
  sometimes we haven’t found self-care practices that we truly love and look
  forward to. This leaves us less than excited to pursue these activities when
  we do finally have the time. If that’s the case for you, give yourself some
  space to experiment and find what works for you.


  I greatly appreciated Vanderkam’s desire to tell stories that are counter to
  the ones we so often hear in our culture about successful women and their
  time. It is a refreshing look at what is _actually_ possible.

  ### Set Yourself Up for Success


  > "If you want to have it all – a life that involves professional success and
  plenty of time for personal pursuits too – then you need to be strategic about
  how you spend your work hours. Invested well, work hours generate great
  returns."- I Know How She Does It, page 95


  To set yourself up for success (however that is defined for you), it is
  important to use your time well. That includes work hours, which often have a
  tendency to be spent on not so important things. Vanderkam suggests several
  strategies to change this for ourselves:


  1.  **Look (and plan) forward** – It’s hard to manage your time when you don’t
  know what is on the horizon. Find some pocket of time to allow yourself to get
  organized. This is often a great thing to do on Friday afternoons, which tend
  to be otherwise unproductive time.

  2.  **Do the real work** – How often have you found yourself doing
  administrative or otherwise not productive tasks at work? It happens to all of
  us. It’s important to realize that we must make time for our real work,
  whatever that may be.

  "It is, in short, about how to enjoy and make the most of your time, by which
  I mean investing as much as you wish in everything that matters: work, family,
  community, leisure. It is about celebrating abundance rather than lamenting
  choices or claiming that no one can have it all."

It is about celebrating abundance rather than lamenting choices or claiming that no one can have it all." _\- I Know How She Does It, page 2_

Laura Vanderkam has made a career out of studying and exploring how people use their time. With each new research project and book she releases, there is a new question that fascinates her. In her latest book _I Know How She Does It_, Vanderkam’s key question was, how do successful women live their (perceived to be) very full lives? This is a question of great debate, borne out of Anne-Marie Slaughter’s now infamous article in _The Atlantic_ claiming that women “cannot have it all.”

With a desire to explore this claim more, Vanderkam set out to analyze 1,001 days recorded by women in her study. What she found was surprising – “Their lives didn’t look that bad.” Yes, they were busy but they have time for family, community and leisure activities. On top of that, most were getting a decent amount of sleep per night. Vanderkam’s analysis morphed into a more interested question that challenges Slaughter’s claim – how can we amend the cultural narratives that we live our lives by? The answer is storytelling that shows us new narratives about the realities of women’s lives.

_I Know How She Does It_ is a unique blend of storytelling about women’s lives coupled with best practices and tips that emerged from the research. Vanderkam looks at three areas of women’s lives – work, home, and self – exploring each in detail to paint a new picture of what successful women’s lives are really like.
