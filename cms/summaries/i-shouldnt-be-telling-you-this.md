  ### Go Big or Go Home


  > "…success is most often the result of doing the bold extra something that no
  one else has thought of or dared to try... doing a job well is not enough. The
  key is to do more than what's expected, power it up, go balls to the wall."- I
  Shouldn’t Be Telling You This, page 6


  **“When was the last time that you made your boss say, ‘Wow’?”** This was a
  question that Kate White asked of the audience at a speaking engagement and
  it’s a good one to ask yourself. People are never successful because they do
  exactly what’s asked of them and nothing more. **People are successful because
  they think outside of the guidelines, do a little bit extra, refuse to do
  something one way just because “that’s the way that it’s always been done.”**


  Go big when grabbing what you want. Whether it’s a minute alone with someone
  you know can help your career or going for a job, success is never found
  sitting still and waiting for life to happen. And, White warns, sometimes
  going big means you’re going to have to break the rules: “you have to take
  what you’ve been told to do and twist it, toss it, or turn it upside down”.
  White shares the story of Kate Spade who, the night before she was going to
  show her purses for the first time at a trade show, looked at them and
  realized that they were fine but nothing was special about them. She cut a
  piece of the label inside and stuck it on the outside – challenging the rule
  that labels go on the inside and creating her iconic look for purses.
  **Whether it’s rethinking an assumption or going forward with a crazy idea, go
  big or go home!**

  ### Drain the Swamp as You Slay the Aligators


  > "I quickly realized how easy it would be to become mired in all the
  day-to-day duties and drama of running the magazine and never get around to
  focusing on what was necessary to evolve it."- I Shouldn't Be Telling You
  This, page 212


  If you have a “to do” list that seems to repeat itself day after day, this tip
  is for you. So often we have a big goal or project that we are working towards
  (draining the swamp) that gets buried under the urgent tasks that come up
  every day (slaying the alligators). To be a success you have to master how to
  do both things at once, in both your personal life as well as your
  professional life. Put time in your schedule to actually drain that swamp.

  ### Have the Eye of the Tiger


  > "(Success:) you have to want it... you have to have the eye of the tiger and
  you have to do it every single day."- Sandra Lee, uoted in I Shouldn’t Be
  Telling You This, page 132


  We all know someone who is completely focused on achieving his/her goal. Their
  passion is inspiring – but do you ever wonder how they stay so passionate?
  White says firstly that for some people, the eye of the tiger is just innate.
  For those of us who aren’t as lucky, we must cultivate it. To do this, Kate
  suggests:


  – Be passionate about your job. **If you want success (in your personal or
  professional life), you need to follow your passion.** If you’re not sure what
  you are passionate about, throughout the book Kate White gives suggestions on
  how to find your passion – but they can really be boiled down to having
  experiences. Whether it’s volunteering, joining clubs, buying a Groupon for
  something you’ve never done but you think “could be fun,” you never know what
  activity you will do that will make you think “this is it… this is me.” And,
  White suggests asking those who love us what they think that we should do.
  Challenge anything that would make you think: “I could NEVER do that.”


  *   Get a taste for success. Whether it’s relishing positive comments on a
  project that you completed or simply observing someone else’s success and how
  they experience it, remember it.

  *   State your goal in a way that makes you excited. Maybe it’s not a raise
  that you are excited about, but a change in title. **Talk about your goal in
  terms of what excites you.** This will help you tough things out when you’re
  working towards it.

  *   Use envy as a motivator.

  *   Stop worrying about how you can mess something up and think about how
  you’re going to impact the people you’re going to meet. Whether in a meeting,
  a sales pitch, or even a networking event, you need to think about what you’re
  bringing to the table more than whatever the worst-case scenario is in your
  head.

  *   Know what you need to know at the moment. Know a little bit about whom
  you’re meeting with, or know about the job that you’re interviewing for.
  Knowing will help you to have more powerful conversations and the confidence
  that comes with knowing will come across.

  **What big success are you looking for in your life?** Share below in the
  comments. Are you truly passionate about what you are doing or is there a
  nagging sense in the back of your head that this is not what you were meant to
  do? No matter what success you are looking for in your life, _I Shouldn’t Be
  Telling You This_ will offer easy tips to help you think big and go for it.
