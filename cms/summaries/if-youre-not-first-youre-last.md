  ### Advance and Conquer


  > "Every resource you have goes to advance and conquer while others contract
  and retreat"- If You’re Not First, You’re Last, page 3


  Right from the beginning Grant makes it clear that there are four responses
  (and attitudes) made by people when the economy or things take a turn for the
  worst in their lives. I love the fourth response, **advance and conquer**,
  because it illustrates the mindset and actions that people who dominate their
  field make on a consistent basis. The advance and conquer approach is about
  being the absolute best at what you do regardless of the external situation.
  It is about going out into the marketplace and doing massive amounts of
  activity above and beyond what is considered normal while your competition is
  still deciding how they will respond. For example: planning your day so
  effectively that you’re able to double or triple your calls and create a
  strategy that enables you to follow up each one with an email to get at least
  two touch points with each client per day. One extreme way to look at the
  advance and conquer mindset is to ask yourself “how would I think, move, act
  and speak differently if I had 24 hours left to live unless I closed a sale by
  the end of the day?” There would probably be a much greater sense of urgency
  than if you thought you had 20 years left to live.

  ### Perform at your highest level always


  > "Make it clear to the world every day that you have things to do and people
  to see."- If You’re Not First, You’re Last, page 155


  In order to get the most out of the The Big Idea and Gem #1, it is necessary
  to be deliberate about the actions that you will take each day and focus your
  thoughts into doing everything you can to complete them. I have found that the
  most successful times in my life, when I got the most done and felt best about
  myself were when I actively took control of my mind by scheduling the most
  important actions that needed to be done that day and doing everything I could
  to complete them rather than leaving my day to chance. Grant suggests that
  people don’t do things like sleep, watch TV, take long lunches or gossip,
  worry about problems or what others think because they are lazy, but rather
  because they lack a commitment to a power schedule. When you have other places
  you have to be and don’t have time for these things, then you just don’t do
  them. A good way to start is by asking yourself these questions:


  a) What time will you go to bed at night and what time you will get up?


  b) What wasteful actions am I currently involved in?


  c) How do I spend my weekends?


  d) How am I spending my time after work?


  e) Are these activities adding to my confidence and the way I feel about
  myself or are they holding me back?


  In addition, Grant has a 10X planner based on his book [_The 10x
  Rule_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-10x-rule/). I have purchased
  my own copy and have found that I have more focus than I have had in the past
  year through scheduling my day using Grant’s template. You can find the
  planner [here](http://www.grantcardone.com/product/10x-planner/) and a
  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMRjjwuLMe0&list=UUdlNK1xcy-Sn8liq7feNxWw)
  on how to use it.

  ### Own your mind and what you believe


  > "Change your thought process. Drop the arrogance, your old beliefs, and any
  limitations on what you are willing to do, and get going on producing your
  economy."- If You’re Not First, You’re Last, page 151


  Having the right thought process is critical for success. In sales, business
  and life we are governed by a certain set of rules that guide how we think and
  act. More often than not these are negative and are rules that enforce what we
  should not do more than what we should. For example: _Am I calling this client
  too much? Am I justified in asking for a referral? What will the client think
  if I don’t negotiate on price?_ Thoughts like these paralyze you from taking
  action and being successful. Grant suggests that most of what we worry about
  tends not to happen, so why waste time worrying about it when that time can be
  spent using your mind on everything you can do to change the situation? If you
  are going to advance and conquer you have to eliminate all the worry, doubt
  and fear of negative consequences that could happen if you act. This is not to
  say you should pretend that everything is okay when you do have reason to
  worry, but readers are encouraged to build their positive thinking muscles so
  they are better equipped to handle challenges.
f_conclusion: >-
  _If You’re Not First, You’re Last_ is great for readers who want to learn from
  someone who practices what they preach. If you are used to searching for
  answers to a problem on the internet and end up finding tons of solutions from
  just about any sales professional but are overwhelmed because you don’t know
  who to listen to, then this book will put you at ease. You won’t have to
  question whether the information here works because it comes from someone with
  tried and tested advice. This a great book for a sales professional or
  entrepreneur of any level of experience to study and apply the strategies
  within. The combination of mental thought processes and specific step-by-step
  instructions make this book perfect for anyone that wants a workable formula
  to get out of a rut and up into the upper echelon of their field.

Grant Cardone is a well-known business speaker and sales guru. At the time of this writing he has written four business books, developed sales training programs for individuals, entrepreneurs, Fortune 500 companies and made appearances on multiple television networks.

In his book, _If You’re Not First, You’re Last_, Grant shares with his readers the specific thought processes and actions necessary to move from where you are right now to the front of your field, regardless of the product or service you sell. Grant draws on his experiences of getting through three recessions, emerging stronger, more capable, and more profitable after each one.

This book shows you how to take everything you already have and direct it into profit through methods Grant has used himself and found to be successful. Each chapter builds on the next, encouraging the reader to follow this step-by-step approach of thinking and acting to help the reader achieve their goals.
