  ### Every Creative Journey Begins with a Problem Hitting a Wall


  > "When we tell one another stories about creativity, we tend to leave out
  this phase of the creative process. We neglect to mention those days when we
  wanted to quit, when we believed that our problems were impossible to solve."-
  Imagine, page 6


  As recently as 20 years ago, the right hemisphere of our brain was thought to
  be a pound and a half of wasted space. Researcher Mark Beeman, studying
  patients with damaged right hemispheres, saw widely varied cognitive problems
  which that view didn’t explain.


  The immense variation in the kinds of challenges Beeman saw made it difficult
  to see a connection. Difficult to the extent that Beeman was at the point of
  giving up when he saw it: the right brain’s purpose was **exactly what he was
  trying to do―make connections;** the subtle connections between seemingly
  unrelated things.


  When we hit a wall, our brain will **shift from left to right** hemisphere… if
  we allow it. When our structured logical brain gets out of the way, electric
  currents in the brain concentrate in the anterior superior temporal gyrus
  (aSTG) located just above the right ear. This shift leads to those “Aha!”
  moments we’ve all had.


  Our instinct as entrepreneurs is to push through the wall with logic; fact and
  reason. Persistence wins, after all. When that doesn’t work, our other
  reaction is to give up.


  Knowing when to do which is powerful. Knowing there’s a third option is
  invaluable. Which brings us to insight #1.

  ### Embrace Critical Debate and Dissent Because Brainstorming Doesn't Work


  > "\[B\]rainstorming didn't unleash the potential of the group. Instead, the
  technique suppressed it, making each individual less creative."- Imagine, page
  159


  You know the brainstorming drill: everyone in the room, shouting ideas to be
  written down without judgment. Create a safe environment and let the free flow
  of ideas build into a storm of creativity. The time for debate and criticism
  comes later.


  Wrong. All wrong. **The entire concept was debunked** shortly after the word
  “brainstorming” was coined in the 50s. Due to some twisted sense of fair play
  in the halls of business, the “no judgment, everyone has a voice” form of
  brainstorming is still haunting us a lifetime later.


  Studies have repeatedly shown that individuals who come up with solutions,
  then come together to debate, to share constructive criticism, **come up with
  not only more solutions, but more creative solutions.** It’s core, in fact, to
  the runaway success of Pixar studios, the only movie studio in history to have
  every single film critically and publicly acclaimed.


  Consensus breeds consensus, not creativity. When seeking a creative solution,
  allow all involved to study the challenge, then give them time alone to work
  on it. When the group reconvenes, **embrace debate and criticism.**


  Begin with a moment of dissent. **Inject surprise** by offering an obviously
  incorrect solution or assessment of the situation. Disconnect participants
  from the default setting of pacific cooperation and create an atmosphere of
  congenial debate.

  ### The Compass to Choosing a Creative Method


  > "What's impressive about such estimates is that people were able to assess
  their closeness to the solution without knowing what the solution was."-
  Imagine, page 82


  We’ve all done it: bumped into someone whose name we know, but can’t remember.


  Think about that for a moment, though: we can know that the information is in
  our brain, even when we don’t know what the information is right now. **You
  know that you know, even though you don’t know** _at the present moment._


  When it comes to problems which don’t require that hemisphere-shifting-flash
  we call “insight”, our brain is **remarkably accurate at assessing whether or
  not a problem can be solved, and even how close we are to solving it.**


  We can know whether this problem requires persistence, or insight.


  We don’t always know how thick or hard a wall is. When you hit one, push. **If
  persistence gains you some ground,** if you feel yourself making progress,
  this is probably a wall you can break through with sheer determination. Bear
  in mind this doesn’t have to be visible or measurable progress; “feelings of
  knowing” are hardly measurable with a yardstick or scale.


  If pushing harder brings feelings of frustration and hopelessness (okay, maybe
  we don’t go that far) then **a better method** is to walk away for a while.
  Take a break. Work on another project, or a hobby, or nothing at all. If you
  can, just look out the window at the beautiful scenery or have a chat with a
  friend about something entirely different from the problem at hand. Sleep on
  it.


  Then try again. And watch for insight.

  Most of us can’t afford to keep getting what we’ve been getting. **Changing
  how we think is core** to changing how we act, and to what comes into our
  life.

How does creativity work? The very question is audacious.

We see two types of problem-solving: inch by inch, gaining ground on a solution, or the flash of insight, unforeseen. All arts, **all acts of human creation are prone to this division.**

Understanding that creativity is not centered in one portion of our brain, in a single specialized process, but **a variety of sometimes unrelated processes,**is vital to unlocking its keys.
