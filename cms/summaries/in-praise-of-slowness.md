  ### Slow Down


  > "The great benefit of slowing down is reclaiming the time and tranquility to
  make meaningful connections—with people, with culture, with work, with nature,
  with our own bodies and minds. Some call that living better."- In Praise of
  Slowness, page 277


  What do you do when you first wake up in the morning? Most of us consult the
  clock, checking the time to see if we are early or late. Then for the rest of
  the day the clock rules to one degree or another as thoughts of minutes and
  hours occupy our attention. We obsess over time and doing the most with it.
  Honorémakes it clear: not all efficiency and speed should be avoided. After
  all, such a focus helped produce the internet and air travel. However, modern
  day enjoyment aside, not everything should be approached with the
  fastest-is-best dogma.


  What does it mean to slow down? Honoréexplains: “Being Slow means never
  rushing, never striving to save time just for the sake of it. It means
  remaining calm and unflustered even when circumstances force us to speed up.”
  Some things in life take time and suffer with relentless speed. Our
  relationships with friends and family, our health, and even personal growth
  stagnate and often wilt under a speed above all else approach. Yes, I might be
  able to buy a microwave dinner and save myself two hours of toiling in the
  kitchen. Fortunately, slowing down does not have to be a one size fits all
  approach.

  ### Unstructured Time


  > "... to make the most of our time, and avoid boredom, we fill up every spare
  moment with mental stimulation. When did you last sit in a chair, close your
  eyes and just relax?"- In Praise of Slowness, page 12


  Studies indicate that when children have unstructured time to play they
  “develop their social and language skills, their creative power and their
  ability to learn.” Unstructured time provides an opportunity to process
  information and make connections, to truly digest a concept. Instead of a
  ballet lesson or soccer practice, unstructured time is hunting for unique bugs
  in the backyard or doodling with crayons. Unstructured time allows for
  curiosity and adventure.


  As adults, do we lose the need to play, make connections with thoughts, or
  just be still? Unstructured time as a child led to some of my best forts or
  Lego creations. We strive to fill every hour of our days with “enriching
  activities” for their productive output because we fear falling behind and
  wasting time.


  Finding a sense of personal balance can help to slow down when it is
  appropriate. Honoréadvises that we give ourselves “some leisure time, some
  recreation, some time for solitude.” Just as a machine cannot be pushed to
  perform at redline efforts without rest, we need a change of pace. Building a
  little unstructured time into your day doesn’t require you burn your calendar
  and to-do list on your way to a life without any sense of time. Try to open up
  some margin each day where you don’t have to be doing something. Once I became
  comfortable enduring longer periods of time without some form of mental
  stimulation I found the feeling freeing. The feeling of zoning out and making
  disparate connections is rejuvenating.

  ### Tempo Guisto?


  > "Most of us do not wish to replace the cult of speed with the cult of
  slowness. Speed can be fun, productive and powerful, and we would be poorer
  without it. What the world needs, and what the Slow movement offers, is a
  middle path, a recipe for marrying la dolce vita with the dynamism of the
  information age."- In Praise of Slowness, page 274


  Some may resist slowing down fearing that they will be passed by, left in last
  place like a Luddite lackey. Honoréexplains that slowing down is not a one
  size fits all situation. For example, some activities make sense to do faster,
  like skiing or traveling on a transatlantic flight. Other undertakings are
  better enjoyed at a more leisurely pace: chatting with friends over a good
  meal, or going for a walk without listening to a podcast or audiobook.


  The author explains the balance between slow and fast by suggesting that you
  “be fast when it makes sense to be fast, and be slow when slowness is called
  for.” This approach is what musicians call “tempo guisto”, the right speed.
  Choosing to slow down is not the opposite of doing everything fast. Slowing
  down is about making a conscious choice rather than allowing the pressure of
  the clock to impose itself on how you spend all your attention. Tempo guisto
  is about finding the appropriate speed for your activity. Just because you can
  do something faster, does not mean you should.
f_conclusion: >-
  While reading _In Praise of Slowness_ I tried to make more of a conscious
  effort to slow down. Recently my wife and I went on a camping trip with the
  express purpose of rejuvenating, so we left our days largely unstructured. We
  set our phones on airplane mode and went throughout the day without much
  notice of the time. We played board games, explored a limestone cave, and
  enjoyed s’mores around the campfire, but generally it was relaxed. Compared to
  most of our vacations where my planning goes into overdrive trying to cram so
  much into each day that I need a day to sleep it off, this trip was
  rejuvenating. Moving at a slower pace allowed me to enjoy many of the details
  that often escape my notice because we are always pressed for time.

  "My whole life has turned into an exercise in hurry, in packing more and more
  into every hour. I am Scrooge with a stopwatch, obsessed with saving every
  last scrap of time, a minute here, a few seconds there."

> "My whole life has turned into an exercise in hurry, in packing more and more into every hour. I am Scrooge with a stopwatch, obsessed with saving every last scrap of time, a minute here, a few seconds there." _\- In Praise of Slowness, page 3_

I once heard that I should budget my time more carefully than I budget my money because I can get more money but more time is impossible to come by. Solid advice. However, any virtue can become a vice if taken to an extreme. While trying to wisely invest one’s time is sensible, obsessing over efficiency and increasing speed to accomplish more is unhealthy. Some even wear their overburdened schedules as a badge of pride.

Why are we always in such a rush? What do we hope to gain from constant redlined effort? Author and journalist Carl Honoré explains _In Praise of Slowness_ that we do not and should not do everything at full speed. After he considered implementing a one minute bedtime story to read to his children, he decided he needed to slow down.

While not everything can be, or should be, done slower, when the right things are it makes a difference.
