  ### Help, Not Harassment


  > "People do not want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by
  salespeople. They want to be helped."- Inbound Marketing, page xviii


  The quote above was the observation of the authors after “many meetings, much
  coffee, and the occasional wine or beer.” It’s the concept you need to grasp
  if you are going to be effective with your marketing efforts in the current
  world. How people shop for goods and services has changed, but has your
  marketing stayed current to keep up with the times?


  Brian and Dharmesh make the point that people use the Internet in three
  specific ways to get the information they desire:


  1.  search engines (primarily Google)

  2.  blogs

  3.  social media sites


  As I think about my own life, I realize they have a valid observation. How
  often do you and I type something into Google during the day? My Feedly has a
  couple dozen blog feeds for the blogs I regularly read and enjoy. In addition
  to checking my email several times a day, I swing by Facebook, LinkedIn, and
  Twitter to see what’s new. Is your online life that different from mine?
  Probably not.

  ### Convert, Convert, Convert


  > "Simply getting visitors to your website isn’t enough. You need to convert
  those leads into prospects and eventually paying customers."- Inbound
  Marketing, page 109


  The goal of all of your marketing efforts should be to get people to engage
  with you and your business. Always provide a variety of ways for people to
  engage further. On each page of your website have a compelling call to action
  such as an opt-in for a free eBook, a free initial consultation, or some type
  of trial offer. Make sure each of your calls to action is valuable, easy,
  prominent, and action oriented.


  Send targeted prospects to a unique landing page just for them and a specific
  offer. Remember, a landing page has only one function — to capture prospect’s
  information such as email or phone number. Typically, the less information you
  ask for on a landing page, the better the conversion rate. Not all leads are
  created equal, some will close right away; others will take months or years.
  Continually conduct what the authors call “lead nurturing” – staying in touch
  with each potential customer so you come to mind when they are ready to
  purchase.

  ### Tips to be outstanding


  > "The trick is to stand out by becoming as remarkable (unique and valuable)
  as possible to a segment of buyers."- Inbound Marketing, page 17


  Can you answer the question “What are you the world’s best at?” If so,
  congratulations! You are more aware than the majority. To stand out from the
  crowd you should write informative articles relevant to your industry and
  provide links to other resources that are relevant. You may want to invite
  others in your area of expertise, or supporting areas, to write articles for
  your blog. As a rule of thumb, you should be posting an article per week and
  gaining credibility and consistency.


  For your articles, practice developing catchy article titles since that is
  what will draw people to your information. Numbered items (top 10), famous
  names (Donald Trump), and well-known companies (Google) do well in titles. At
  the end of every article have a call to action like “leave your comments
  below”, or “email me to discuss this”, etc.


  As you write your articles, think about the keywords you should use. When
  picking keywords think relevance and what words your ideal customer would type
  into Google when searching. Also, make sure your page titles on your web pages
  contain your keywords.

> "Inbound marketing is about getting found online, through search engines and on social networking sites that billions of people use to find answers each day." _\- Inbound Marketing, page xii_

The subtitle of _Inbound Marketing_ is _Attract, Engage, and Delight Customers Online_ and the premise is that it is a comprehensive guide to increasing online visibility and engagement. Written by top marketing and startup bloggers, the book contains the latest information about customer behavior and preferred digital experiences. From the latest insights on lead nurturing and visual marketing to advice on producing remarkable content by building valuable tools, readers will gain the information they need to transform their marketing online. This book provides the new strategies you need to get more free traffic from Google, build a valuable business blog, create a social media following and analyze which of your marketing efforts are working.

With outbound marketing methods becoming less effective, the time to embrace inbound marketing is now. Cold calling, e-mail blasts, and direct mail are turning consumers off to an ever-greater extent, so consumers are increasingly doing their own research online to choose companies and products that meet their specific needs and wants. _Inbound Marketing_ recognizes these behavioral changes as opportunities, and explains how marketers can make the most of this shift. This not only addresses turning strangers into website visitors, but explains how best to convert those visitors to leads, and to nurture those leads to the point of becoming delighted customers.
