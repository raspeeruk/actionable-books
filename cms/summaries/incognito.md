  ### We Only Need Half a Brain


  > "Our hopes, dreams, aspirations, fears, comic instincts, great ideas,
  fetishes, sense of humor, and desires all emerge from this strange organ – and
  when the brain changes so do we."- Incognito, page 4


  Did you know that doctors can successfully remove one half of the brain of an
  eight year old child and he’ll be fine? (This is a proven treatment for
  intractable epilepsy caused by Rasmussen’s encephalitis). Not any half of the
  brain – they couldn’t remove just the front or back; they have to remove
  either the right side or the left side of the brain. But because the right and
  left halves reveal themselves as something like copies of each other, it is
  possible to remove one half and still have all the functionality you’d expect
  from a full-brained person (page 125).


  Clearly, the brain is a mysterious and complicated thing, made up of cells,
  neurons, electrical impulses and the like which work together to make us who
  we are. Our subconscious runs the show while our conscious explains and
  verbalizes why we do what we do and, although we think we’re in control of our
  behaviour all the time, brain science is demonstrating that this isn’t always
  true. Based on the development of different parts of our brains, whether we’re
  “right-brain” thinkers or “left-brain” thinkers, and any damage our brains
  have experienced as a result of trauma or insufficient chemical composition,
  we all behave differently in various situations.

  ### Unequal Before the Law


  > "The built-in myth of human equality suggests that all people are equally
  capable of decision making, impulse control and comprehending consequences.
  While admirable, the notion is simply not true."- Incognito, page 187


  Our modern legal system is somewhat based on the assumption that all humans
  are equal before the law – but this idea is “simply not true” (page 187).
  Humans bring all sorts of preconceived notions, experiences, morals and rules
  to the table, based on our environments, capacity for learning, family lives
  and how we were raised. Because of these differences, it is not reasonable to
  assume that we all understand actions and consequences in the same way nor do
  we respond to punishment or behaviour modification in the same way. Because of
  this, it is impossible for us to fairly sentence all criminals using the same
  punishments. And yet, this is exactly what we do, using precedence and history
  to dictate punishment instead of individual capacity, and thereby assuring
  ourselves that we’ve provided “fair” punishment.


  As neuroscience improves, Eagleman and his scientific colleagues will be able
  to help tailor sentencing and rehabilitation to the individual offender,
  suggesting that science will help to replace intuition about blameworthiness
  with a fairer approach based on the individual’s capacity to modify their
  behaviour as indicated by what can be seen in their brain. For example, a
  teenager who hasn’t fully developed the frontal portion of the brain should be
  punished differently than someone with frontal lobe damage, who will never
  develop the capacity of socialization because of this damage. “The important
  change will be in the _way_ we punish the vast range of criminal acts – in
  terms of rational sentencing and new ideas for rehabilitation. The emphasis
  will shift from punishment to recognizing problems (both neural and social)
  and meaningfully addressing them” (page 191).

  ### Emotional and Rational Battles


  > "You are a charioteer, and your chariot is pulled by two thunderous horses,
  the white horse of reason and the black horse of passion."- Incognito, page
  115


  Human beings are social animals, connecting most strongly to each other on
  emotional levels. Eagleman uses the following example to prove this point:
  “imagine a trolley is barreling down the train tracks, out of control. Five
  workers are making repairs way down the track, and you, a bystander, quickly
  realize that they will all be killed by the trolley. But you also notice that
  there is a switch nearby that you can throw, and that will divert the trolley
  down a different track, where only a single worker will be killed. What do you
  do? (Assume there are no trick solutions or hidden information.)” (page 111).
  If you’re like most people, you’d flip the switch so only one person is harmed
  instead of five – a terrible choice to make but better to sacrifice one for
  many perhaps. But now imagine you’re on a footbridge that goes over the
  tracks, those same workers are on the track and an obese man is standing next
  to you on the footbridge. You realize that if you were to push the obese man
  off the bridge, his weight would be enough to stop the momentum of the train
  and save the workers – but do you push him?


  You’re likely more conflicted over the second choice than the first but why?
  Isn’t the math the same in both as far as one for many goes? Philosophers
  suggest the difference lies in how people are being used. In the first
  scenario, you are simply reducing a bad situation – in the second, you’re
  exploiting a human being as a means to an end. But Eagleman and other
  neuroscientists suggest there may be a brain-based approach – that the brain
  “pivots on the emotional component of actually touching someone” (page 112).
  This sort of personal interaction activates the emotional networks, changing
  an abstract, non-personal situation into something real and emotional.
  Research involving brain imaging reveals that when faced with the footbridge
  scenario, areas involved in motor planning and emotion become active. In
  contrast, in the track-switch scenario, only lateral areas involved in
  rational thinking become active. “People register emotionally when they have
  to push someone; when they only have to tip a lever, their brain behaves like
  _Star Trek’s_ Mr. Spock” (page 113).
f_conclusion: >-
  Even though the brain has been studied for hundreds of years and neuroscience
  makes huge discoveries daily, the brain is still largely misunderstood.
  Scientists have been breaking our brains down into its individual parts,
  expecting that these parts will enable us to understand the whole but we’re
  still not sure if this approach will work in neuroscience. The brain is unlike
  anything scientists have studied so far – vast, complex, and almost magical –
  and fortunately, we’re part of the lucky generation with the technology,
  capability and will to turn our attention to it. “Whatever else exists beyond
  the limits of science is an open question for future generations” (page 224).

When you move your arm, are you aware of the movement? Do you think about the muscles and how they’re contracting to make your fingers curl or your elbow bend? Likely not. This is the work of your subconscious, the deep part of your brain responsible for making your body work. In his book, _Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain_, David Eagleman compares the conscious and subconscious this way: Think of your conscious as the CEO of your body and your subconscious as all the worker bees and contributors to your body’s company. The worker bees are always working, moving your body in familiar ways, experiencing your surroundings on behalf of your body and keeping you moving through life, only getting the CEO, your conscious, involved when something is unfamiliar or needs attention. In this deep and mysterious connection, the two parts of our brain work together to keep us functioning – but how and why do we do it? Eagleman and his colleagues in neuroscience have spent the last 2000 years trying to figure it out… and this book explains a little bit about how.
