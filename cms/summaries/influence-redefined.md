  ### How influential are you really?


  > "We have a misperception of what influence is and an outdated, inadequate
  understanding of what it means to be influential."- Influence Redefined, page
  4


  Hanke states that the common definition of influence is “the ability to
  motivate people to take action”. While certainly true, she says that this
  definition is incomplete. It implies that influence is something we do
  episodically when we want people to take action.


  Hanke’s definition of influence is much broader:


  *   Monday to Monday. Consistent actions all the time, in all situations, that
  are congruent with your purposes and priorities.

  *   Moving people to action long after the interaction is over.

  *   Creating a standout experience that separates you from the crowd.

  *   Solid verbal and non-verbal communication.

  *   Measured not by how you feel but by the results you consistently achieve.

  *   A skill that can be developed by anyone through feedback, practice and
  accountability.


  The top thing that stood out for me in this definition was congruence. It got
  me wondering, am I consistent in what I believe and do and say?


  According to Hanke, we must bring our “A” game to every instance of
  communication. Primarily, to show we care.


  Hanke asks us to think about whether people have the same experience with us
  in a Tweet, a one-on-one conversation, a meeting, and a quick after hours
  text. She reminds me that I can’t facilitate a meeting with a powerful
  presence and then follow up with an email filled with typos and expect
  respect.


  Note to self: In future, make sure I re-check texts before sending
  them—auto-correct is not always my friend!

  ### The video never lies


  > "As much as you may not want to do it, videoing yourself is one of the
  greatest investments you can make in your life, both professionally and
  personally."- Influence Redefined, page 122


  Hanke challenges us by saying that if we want to be more influential, and we
  do nothing else, we must video record ourselves speaking.


  So I did. And I didn’t love what I saw or heard. But neither did the author,
  at first. However, she reminds us that it is important to see ourselves as our
  audience sees us.


  Hanke provides a few quick review processes:


  First watch the video from your listener’s viewpoint and dispassionately ask:
  “Would I be influenced by this person I see and hear on the video?”


  Second, watch with no sound. Observe your body language, eye contact,
  gestures, facial expressions and movements. Do you look confident? Do your
  “non-verbals” support or distract from your message?


  Third, listen without watching. Do you sound confident? Is your tone and are
  your speaking habits congruent with your message?

  ### It's not all about you


  > "Influence is about the experience you create for someone else."- Influence
  Redefined, page 35


  Hanke drives home the point that in order to be influential we need to ensure
  we’re meeting our audience’s needs, not our own needs. It reminds me of the
  old joke: “Enough about me, let’s talk about you… what do you think of me?”


  She challenges us to think about every piece of communication as an
  opportunity to create a standout experience—even in a Tweet. The message was
  reinforced in a recent video interview I watched, where [Chris Anderson of TED
  says](https://www.ted.com/talks/chris_anderson_teds_secret_to_great_public_speaking/transcript?language=enFQjCNHzhiCubssaOQhDdQCIQUJ-ld21Sw)
  every talk is an act of generosity if we ask “what gift could I give these
  people?”
f_conclusion: >-
  There’s more to being influential, but self-awareness and a commitment to
  practice, together with an unwavering focus on your audience’s experience,
  will take you a long way.

> "Most people aren't as influential as they think they are." _\- Influence Redefined, page 3_

Most of us want to be more influential, whether it be with family, at work, or in broader societal terms. Stacey Hanke’s book, _Influence Redefined: Be the Leader You Were Meant to Be, Monday to Monday_, offers the promise that we can be more influential, if we are prepared to think differently and, more importantly, if we act consistently.

But Hanke says that most of us believe we are more influential than we really are, so our starting point is a reality check of what we understand influence to mean and how we currently communicate.

If you truly want to be more influential, find a buddy, commit to honest feedback and enjoy the practice. Your audience will love it and so will you—eventually.
