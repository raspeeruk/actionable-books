  ### We are Responsible For Inventing the Future


  > "Creativity can be enhanced by honing your ability to observe and learn, by
  connecting and combining ideas, by reframing problems, and by moving beyond
  the first right answers."- inGenius, page 201


  Seelig has created a new model to help explain creativity and innovation. It’s
  called the **Innovation Engine** and it looks like this:


  ![](/assets/external/65d78a9a7677ac7268994c91_innovation-engine.jpeg)


  Like most things, creativity is the sum of its parts and Seelig uses her model
  to explain how all the factors work together to enhance creativity. The
  **Innovation Engine** is explained this way:


  *   _“Your knowledge provides the fuel for your imagination._

  *   _“Your imagination is the catalyst for the transformation of knowledge
  into new ideas._

  *   _“Your attitude is a spark that sets the_ **_Innovation Engine_** _in
  motion._

  *   _“Resources are all the assets in your community._

  *   _“Habitats are your local environments, including your home, school or
  office._

  *   _“Culture is the collective beliefs, values and behaviours in your
  community.”_


  Basically, what Seelig explains in clear, concise language is that in the
  inside of the **Innovation Engine** are the parts of you that enhance
  creativity. It’s up to you to apply the thoughts, mind-set and creative
  thinking to the factors on the outside of the Innovation Engine – factors
  outside your control but those that have influence over your everyday
  interactions. By focusing on the factors you can control, you can learn how
  every moment provides an opportunity to creatively respond in any situation.

  ### No Limits


  > "In fact, believing that there is a solution to your problem is a critical
  step in finding one."- inGenius, page 170


  Has anyone seen those bus shelter ads lately for Mike’s Hard Lemonade? The
  ones that say “If it ain’t broke, break it.”? I think the creativity behind
  those ads is great – Mike’s is asking us to be creative and push the limits of
  the status quo to create something different and unique. Did you know that
  Mike’s Hard Lemonade was a game-changer in its day – the first malt-based
  cooler to be sold in grocery stores in the US? Previous to Mike’s, coolers
  weren’t sold in grocery stores as only wines and malt-based beverages (read:
  beer) were legally allowed to be purchased outside liquor stores. So what did
  Mike’s do? Replaced the vodka-based alcohol in their beverages and put in a
  malt-based alcohol, thus meeting the regulations established by the liquor
  boards and increasing their distribution by phenomenal rates. Game changer.
  You must first believe that you can find solutions to any problem, know that
  you’re not limited by the boundaries you’ve constructed around a situation and
  open your mind to potential. It’s about attitude – “having the conviction that
  problems can be solved” (page 170) – and not allowing a closed mind stop you
  from changing the game.

  ### Situational Creativity


  > "The space told a powerful story, and each team dutifully placed itself
  inside that narrative."- inGenius, page 96


  Like many in the Actionable Books community, I’m a self-employed entrepreneur.
  One of the hardest lessons I had to learn when I quit my corporate job and
  moved to my home office was what environment, or habitat, I felt most
  productive in. Was I full of motivation and creative energy sitting on my
  couch with my laptop or at my desk in the office upstairs? Did sitting on the
  back deck with music in the background distract or focus my attention? Turns
  out, the best place for me to work was the island in my kitchen – close enough
  to the fridge for a snack when I wanted, in a wide open space where I didn’t
  feel constricted by four walls but still at a workspace where I had to sit up
  and pay attention. Habitat makes a lot of difference when it comes to
  creativity and innovation, a powerful thought Seelig proved by accident during
  a simulation game in her class. She’d broken the class into two groups where
  they had to complete jigsaw puzzles in the shortest amount of time. One group
  was on the side of the room where there were small tables but no chairs and
  the other group worked with chairs but no tables. Each group completed the
  same puzzles but in completely different ways. No matter how often
  participants go through this activity, the result is the same – the team with
  the chairs and no tables immediately start to collaborate, pushing chairs out
  of the way and working together on the floor. The team with the tables stay at
  their tables, not leaving those spaces nor collaborating together at all, thus
  limiting their number of points earned. When the activity is over and Seelig
  points out the phenomenon, participants are always shocked to learn how the
  habitat they work in has such a profound effect on the way they operate.
f_conclusion: >-
  At the end of the day, doesn’t everything come down to attitude – changing the
  way we think and behave in new and creative ways? It’s about using the factors
  we can control – knowledge, imagination, habitat and attitude – and learning
  how to put those together with our resources and cultures to create new and
  innovative approaches to life. By learning about ourselves and breaking
  through our personal limitations, experimenting with established practices and
  changing our perceptions and outlook of the world, we have “the power to
  overcome challenges and generate opportunities of all dimensions” (page 201).
  Change the game.

Seems sort of counter-intuitive – a book to teach you how to be more creative. Isn’t that the point of creativity? To be unbound and not stifled by rules and procedures, to allow ones’ mind to become free and open, taking in and applying all the possibilities? That’s true – but how do you get to that “free and open” state? How does your mind open to that potential, that whole “outside-the-box” thinking and creatively solve problems without applying logic or structure or boundaries? It’s this that Tina Seelig teaches us in her new book, _inGenius: A Crash Course on Creativity;_ that the secret to creativity is learning how to stretch your mind. A follow-up to her widely read (and ActionableBooks reviewed), [_What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/what-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-was-20-2/), in _inGenius_, Seelig introduces us to some of the things she teaches her students in the Stanford Technology Ventures Program at Stanford University and the theory and discipline behind creativity.
