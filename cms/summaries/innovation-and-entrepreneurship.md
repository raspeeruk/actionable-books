  ### Entrepreneurs Search for, Respond to and Exploit Change as an Opportunity


  > "Entrepreneurs see change as the norm and as healthy. Usually, they do not
  bring about the change themselves. But—and this defines entrepreneur and
  entrepreneurship—the entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it,
  and exploits it as an opportunity."- Innovation and Entrepreneurship, page 28


  Innovation and Entrepreneurship was originally published in 1985, however the
  practices and teachings are still relevant today. This book is split into
  three distinct sections: the practice of innovation, the practice of
  entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial strategies. In the practice of
  innovation Drucker discusses the importance of constantly innovating and
  actively searching for opportunities, as it is necessary for survival in the
  marketplace. In the second section, Drucker highlights the notion of
  entrepreneurial leadership and how it is necessary for any innovations to be
  successful in business, service institutions or new ventures. In the third
  section Drucker shares the best strategies to introduce innovations to the
  marketplace.


  The thesis of this book is summarized in the following key themes:


  1.  Innovation is purposeful and a discipline

  2.  Entrepreneurship is the institution which carries the innovation

  3.  Management and entrepreneur strategy is required in order to successfully
  bring innovation to the market

  ### Treat Entrepreneurship as a Duty


  > "Entrepreneurial businesses treat entrepreneurship as a duty. They are
  disciplined about it they work at it, they practice it."- Innovation and
  Entrepreneurship, page 150


  Drucker makes it clear that entrepreneurship and innovation can be achieved by
  any business if it is a priority and consciously strived for. Both disciplines
  can be learned through effort and commitment.


  When it comes to business operations of any size, there will always be
  conflicting priorities or a daily crisis that must be dealt with right away
  and cannot be postponed. This is why it is pertinent for the disciplines of
  innovation and entrepreneurship to be deeply rooted and baked into the
  organization and set as a priority.


  The art of entrepreneurial management requires policies and practices in four
  major areas:


  1.  The organization must be receptive to innovation and perceive change as an
  opportunity rather than a threat. Policies and practices are necessary to
  create an entrepreneurial climate in the business.

  2.  The systematic measurement or appraisal of a company’s performance as an
  entrepreneur and innovator is mandatory, as well as built-in learning to
  improve performance.

  3.  Entrepreneurial management requires specific practices pertaining to
  organizational structure, to staffing and managing and to compensation,
  incentives and rewards.

  4.  There are some “DONT’s” in entrepreneurial management


  The three core fundamental “DONT’s” that Drucker advises are:


  *   Do not mix managerial units and entrepreneurial ones.

  *   Innovative efforts that take the existing business out of its own field
  are rarely successful.

  *   It is almost always futile to avoid making one’s own business
  entrepreneurial by “buying in,” that is by acquiring small entrepreneurial
  ventures.


  Through the principles of innovation, the principles of entrepreneurship and
  entrepreneurial strategies Drucker has taken the notion of innovation and
  entrepreneurship and bottled it into a formula.


  When it comes to the essentialism of innovation and entrepreneurship, Drucker
  states “In fact if today’s products or services do not generate a continuing
  and large revenue stream, the enterprise will not be able to make the
  substantial invest in tomorrow that innovation requires.”


  It is essential for the future of the business to focus on the day-to-day
  business operations but also invest in their future through consistently
  innovating and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit.

  ### The Seven Main Sources of Innovation


  > "Entrepreneurs innovate. Innovation is the specific instrument of
  entrepreneurship. It is the act that endows resources with a new capacity to
  create wealth. Innovation, indeed, creates a resource. There is no such thing
  as a “resource” until man finds a use for something in nature and thus endows
  it with economic value."- Innovation and Entrepreneurship, page 30


  Through Drucker’s definition of innovation it is clear that the one who
  “innovates” is merely taking something that has already existed previously and
  positioning it in a way that will create value and therefore, generate wealth.
  Systematic innovation is purposeful and is an organized search for change.
  Wherever an innovation is introduced it changes the economy from a supply
  driven to a demand driven economy.


  In this section, Drucker explores the seven main sources in which innovative
  opportunity can be found. It is possible for the lines between these sources
  to become blurred as there is a degree of overlap between them. Drucker
  describes them as seven windows, each is a different side of the same
  building. The seven sources are:


  1.  1\. _The unexpected_ – the unexpected success, the unexpected failure, the
  unexpected outside event

  2.  _The incongruity_ – between reality as it actually is and reality as it is
  assumed to be or as it “ought to be”

  3.  _Innovation based on process need_

  4.  _Changes in industry structure or market structure_ that catch everyone
  unaware

  5.  _Demographics_

  6.  _Changes in perception, mood, or meaning_

  7.  _New knowledge, both scientific and nonscientific_


  The first four of these sources lie within the enterprise, whether it be
  business, public-service institution or within an industry or service sector.
  Which means they are usually only visible to the people within that industry.
  They can be thought of as the symptoms, and therefore reliable indicators of
  changes that either have happened or could be pursued.


  The last three sources of innovative opportunity involve the changes that
  reside outside the enterprise or industry.


  Drucker goes on to further explain that purposeful innovation—one which
  results from analysis, systems and hard work—is the practice of innovation.
  The foundational principles of the discipline are:


  _DOs_


  1.  _Start with an analysis of all the opportunities: think through the
  sources of innovative activity._

  2.  _Innovation is conceptual and perceptual. Go out to look, to ask, to
  listen._

  3.  _To be effective, be simple and be focused._

  4.  _Effective innovations start small. Do one specific thing and then be able
  to adapt._

  5.  _Aim at leadership in an industry or market. If not, you will create an
  opportunity for the competition._


  _DON’Ts_


  1.  _Don’t try to be clever: aim at ordinary human beings._

  2.  _Don’t diversify, don’t splinter, don’t do too many things at once._

  3.  _Don’t innovate for the future: innovate for the present!_
f_conclusion: >-
  In today’s corporate driven society we view entrepreneurs as risk takers.
  Drucker however sees it the opposite, that an entrepreneur is not a risk taker
  per se, but rather one who has managed the risk that they are going to be
  embarking on.
f_quote-2: >-
  “The temptation in the existing business is always to feed yesterday and to
  starve tomorrow. It is, of course, a deadly temptation. The enterprise that
  does not innovate inevitably ages and declines. And in a period of rapid
  change, such as the present, an entrepreneur period, the decline will be
  fast.”

Peter Drucker is renowned as the founder of modern day management. The words “innovation” and “entrepreneurship” are usually associated with chance or luck. Drucker dismisses this notion and makes it evident that innovation and entrepreneurship are principles that can be measured and learned if effective strategies and practices are applied.

Do you consider an entrepreneur to be a risk taker or one who has managed the risk they will be embarking on?
