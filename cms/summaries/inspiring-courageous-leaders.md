  ### Know and be yourself in all spheres of life


  > "The Courageous Leaders Model is about exploring the way you currently lead
  others—your family or an organization, or both. This book is also about
  discovering what kind of leader you are and would still like to become."-
  Inspiring Courageous Leaders, page 11


  One of the highlights of this book is the author’s emphasis that our own
  leadership style should be the same in all aspects of our lives, whether we
  are thinking of how we are as parents or leaders in our community, to the type
  of leadership style we have in the workplace. As a working mother, this
  resonated with me and reaffirms my own belief that no one should have to leave
  part of themselves behind as they walk into their workplace.


  Leadership Mastery is the cornerstone of the model as this requires the reader
  to consider their character, personality and capability. Mandy Holloway
  explains that these three components are critical and that we all need to
  understand what these look like for us. Doing so requires developing
  self-knowledge and learning what is important to us, and assists us in taking
  action and producing outcomes that are in line with our sense of purpose. To
  develop this self-awareness we must also be courageous in seeking feedback
  from those around us to create our own personal learning agenda.

  ### There is always room for improvement


  > "The infinity symbol is used in the Courageous Leaders Model to represent
  this unlimited growth potential and development possibilities available to
  existing and emerging leaders..."- Inspiring Courageous Leaders, page 16


  There are nine elements to the Courageous Leadership Model—all of which are
  critical to creating an environment where people can be themselves, be
  encouraged to achieve their potential and are aligned with the goals of their
  organization. The author emphasizes that these nine steps (listed below) are
  iterative and that we need to always be open to change and challenge, and that
  this takes courage.


  1.  **Leadership Mastery** – This involves being an authentic leader and
  stresses the importance of positive relationships and interactions with
  others, making effective and efficient business decisions, and have
  credibility in your chosen profession.

  2.  **Confidence** – The self-belief to make the choices that enable you to be
  at your best.

  3.  **Conviction** – Putting your expertise, knowledge, and self-belief to use
  and making things happen, taking total responsibility for the full
  consequences of these actions.

  4.  **Courage developed** – Building courage in your own knowledge and skills
  as you put into action your conviction and learn from its consequences.

  5.  **Connect and Commit** – To have genuinely open conversations with others
  with transparency and vulnerability.

  6.  **Courage unleashed** – Stop procrastinating and ensure you have the
  conversations that you need to have.

  7.  **Challenge** – Conversations to disrupt the status quo and enable
  learning.

  8.  **Change** – See change as core to your lifelong journey to becoming the
  leader you want to be and one that the business needs.

  9.  **High-performance culture** – By following the previous elements and
  encouraging those around you to do the same, you can create a culture which
  encourages high performance and long-term business sustainability.

  ### Conversation is at the heart of leadership


  > "Culture is built or destroyed each time people have a conversation, make a
  decision, choose a behavior and ignite ideas within others. At its very
  essence it is the way we treat each other when working with each other to
  achieve business outcomes."- Inspiring Courageous Leaders, page 13


  We express our leadership mastery in five ways: our thinking, our actions,
  what we say, when we act, and our beliefs. These are all present when we have
  conversations with other people and have an influence on the type of
  relationships we create and build. To use these positively, it is important
  that we:


  *   Bring consciousness to our thinking and avoid our automatic responses to
  situations.

  *   Bring our real selves to the workplace.

  *   Reflect on whether what you say to others sits with the type of leader you
  want to be and the organization needs you to be.

  *   Reflect on how long it takes you to act, as this can indicate how
  important something really is to you.

  *   Know your values and ensure you live them every day.


  Having awareness of the above is an important first step. To develop and build
  Relationship Mastery, consider how you can also implement the following four
  strategies:


  1.  Think the best not the worst; suspend judgement.

  2.  Listen with the intention to understand the other person.

  3.  Have the courage to share your own thoughts and views.

  4.  Take responsibility for your actions and the perceptions they create.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Inspiring Courageous Leaders_ gives the reader a lot to consider and can at
  times be confronting, especially in reading the author’s strong assertions
  that much of what we experience and practice in leadership is based on fear
  and that this has a negative influence on our decisions and choices. In turn,
  this is detrimental to organizational culture and leaves me wondering what the
  world of work could look like if we had more individuals implementing and role
  modelling the behaviors Mandy identifies as representing courageous
  leadership.

Mandy Holloway is extremely passionate about her topic, and generously shares with the reader her own learnings and leadership development journey, both as an employee and as a mother. _Inspiring Courageous Leaders_ provides plenty of information and food for thought for leaders at all levels of experience, from emerging through established. The book is handily designed as a workbook for individuals to work through and covers developing an understanding of Mandy’s leadership model, building confidence in your leadership mastery and exploring how to improve key aspects of your leadership ranging from relationships, business, and technical knowledge. It ends with encouraging you to commit to improving in the areas you have identified and notes that this is a continuing journey. If you wish to develop your approach to leadership, this is a book well worth considering. If you take all the lessons and learning contained in this book, it’s likely to become a well-worn favorite on your bookshelf.

I particularly enjoyed the end of each chapter, which contains a section on ‘Rattling Your Cage’. Each of these provides thought provoking questions which ask the reader to consider what they have read in application to themselves and their leadership style. Taking the time to answer these and putting some of the thoughts into action will inevitably help anyone improve their leadership style in the areas they choose to do so.
