  ### 365 Steps


  > "Five-year strategy sessions are good – but not ultimately effective because
  without a tangible, actionable, measurable plan, people’s wheels start to
  spin."- Inspiring Entrepreneurs, page 105


  Three key words in there – “tangible”, “actionable” and “measureable”. You may
  have heard of


  “SMART goals”; the acronym standing for Specific, Measurable, Attainable,
  Realistic and Timely. Reiniger’s three focus words are similar, but with one
  key differentiation – what she’s talking about is the plan, not just the goal.


  Goals are great. They get you excited, and ideally provide an end point to
  direct all your efforts. But goals alone are only one small piece of the
  puzzle. “The Plan” is the next step – the path you intend to take from Here
  (current reality) to There (realized goal). A plan is what distinguishes a
  goal from a wish. So how do we make a “tangible”, “actionable” and
  “measurable” plan? For Reiniger, experience has shown that one year is the
  optimal time frame to work within.


  The advice from _Inspiring Entrepreneurs_ is straight forward: instead of
  complicated planning and big picture strategy sessions, pick one tangible,
  actionable and measurable goal for the next 365 days, and then work your butt
  off to make it happen. Everyone needs a plan, but it doesn’t have to be
  complicated.

  ### Time Out with a Newbie


  > "Taking time to reflect on your business … will allow you to work on your
  business, instead of always working in it."- Inspiring Entrepreneurs, page xi


  Come up for air every now and then. As mentioned, whatever the project you’re
  working on, chances are you got into it because you loved the idea – you were
  excited about the potential. It’s easy to get lost in the “work”, though, and
  to lose sight of the objective. Taking scheduled breaks to reconnect with your
  purpose, passion and plan can have a major effect on your attitude and
  productivity during your “working” hours.


  Reiniger has a very specific structure and set of activities she recommends
  for creating “breathing time” when involved in any long term project. (It can
  be found on page 128 of _Inspiring Entrepreneurs_.) One great idea from that
  structure is as follows:


  **Have Monthly Accountability Meetings with Someone Else**


  Meet up with someone monthly to run through your progress and monthly
  activity. Here’s the cool part – it’s even better if that person knows very
  little about your business. Their lack of insight will force you to review all
  the details of the project more clearly than you would on you own. Their
  distance from the project will also give them a unique perspective and while
  their role is really meant to be more of a sounding board, they may offer
  valuable insights as well. As an added bonus, their interest in the project
  will help to rekindle your own passion, as you share your vision of what’s to
  come and what you’re doing to get there.

  ### Patience, Patience, Patience (Oh, and Hard Work)


  > "We find that with our clients, almost 100% of the results happen in the
  last six months of the one year that we work with them, but ALL of the work we
  do in the first six months is a crucial part of the building process –
  building credibility, contacts and momentum."- Inspiring Entrepreneurs, page
  105


  Farmers know this: you can’t collect the fruit the same day you plant the
  seed. And yet, in our “instant gratification” society, we very often get
  frustrated when we don’t see immediate results. Reiniger (and the other
  entrepreneurs polled for the book) preach patience. It’s always those who work
  just a little bit longer and try just a little bit harder that realize the
  success they seek. So often we give up on something just before that “tipping
  point”; that moment of success when things start to slide into place. Seth
  Godin wrote an excellent
  [**book**](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-dip/) on the phenomenon
  known as “the dip” which plays a major factor in the success of the few and
  the failure of the unprepared. Having a one year plan can play a key role in
  providing the motivation and direction to keep going when times get tough. No
  matter what the venture, remember the old adage:


  “That which is easy to attain is rarely worth having, and that which is worth
  having is rarely easy.”
f_conclusion: >-
  _Inspiring Entrepreneurs_ is a brilliant little book written by a dynamic and
  driven young woman. With contributions from dozens of highly successful
  entrepreneurs and jam packed with exercises and worksheets, _Inspiring
  Entrepreneurs_ is a must have for any aspiring entrepreneur or person
  interested in taking on a new project in a leadership role. Not to be missed.

Hopefully, if you’re considering a new venture, a new job or a new project of any kind, you’re excited about it. If not, you’re beaten before you begin. Any truly successful person is so because they’re passionate about what they do. Chances are if you’ve read even a couple our Actionable summaries, you’ve picked up on our passion for passion. It’s a crucial first step.

As an author, speaker, and serial entrepreneur, Carissa Reiniger (oh, and she’s 27 years old) reminds us in her book _Inspiring Entrepreneurs_, passion alone is not enough. Once you have an idea that grabs you, one that truly fills you with fire and enthusiasm (regardless of whether you’re an entrepreneur or just someone starting something new), you need to sit down, pen (or keyboard) in hand, and take a hard look at the “business” side of things. You need to start with a plan.
