  ### The Law of Psychological Reactance — Reinforcing Autonomy


  > "We tend to react very negatively when our freedom is verbally threatened...
  \[it\] can be restored by such autonomy-enhancing statements as ‘It’s up to
  you,’ and ‘This is really your decision.’ If we’re motivating ourselves, we
  should remember that we don’t absolutely have to do anything."- Instant
  Influence, page 41


  “Reinforcing Autonomy” is the second chapter, but I actually read it several
  months before the rest of the book; it stands so well on its own that a friend
  of mine lent me her copy to read that section. While this section is not
  directly part of the six step process, it is valuable on its own for the way
  it helps reframe questions of motivation.


  The law of psychological reactance states that **“if someone tells you to do
  something, you probably won’t feel like doing it, even if you might otherwise
  have wanted to.”** Intuitively, we know this to be true of ourselves and
  others we interact with. Why then, do we continually barrage people with
  reasons why they should do something? This is related to reverse psychology.

  ### The Dead Man's Rule


  > "Don’t try to motivate anyone to do anything that a dead man could do just
  as well."- Instant Influence, page 87


  This last point is simple: **motivation works much better when it’s a
  motivation to _do_ something, rather than to _not do_ something else**. For
  example, someone who is dead can very easily not yell at their spouse, whereas
  a dead man can’t use reflective listening. There are a few reasons for why
  this reframing is powerful:


  1\. Everyone is always doing something, so if you’re going to eliminate a
  behaviour it has to be replaced with a different one.  

  2\. It is much easier to visualize — and therefore perform — a small specific
  action in a certain circumstance than it is to just avoid some behaviour
  altogether.  

  3\. In general, positive framings of motives and aims have been shown to be
  several times more effective than negative ones in producing personal change.


  Ironically, the wording used above doesn’t follow its own advice. If you want
  to reword it so it does, you could say “Only try to motivate people to do
  things, rather than to avoid things.”

  ### The Five Whys


  > "You start by asking, ‘Why are those outcomes important to you?’ For every
  answer you get, you repeat the question, until you’ve asked it five times.
  Invariably, the answers move almost magically from the practical and
  impersonal to the heartfelt."- Instant Influence, page 93


  For each of the six steps mentioned above, there are further details that help
  the steps work better, but this one is particularly powerful. It’s important
  to note that many people you’re talking to will get annoyed if you just keep
  saying “Why?” “Why?” so reword it to respond to what they’ve said, e.g. “And
  why is spending time with your family important to you?”


  **A key element here is reflective listening:** **rather than just probing,
  pause to understand what they’ve said at each level before delving deeper.**
  Reflective listening isn’t taught as part of _Instant Influence_, but it’s
  definitely a complementary skill.
f_conclusion: >-
  I’d recommend _Instant Influence_ to anyone interested in the science of
  motivation. The book walks through each of the steps here and provides many
  examples and exercises to help readers rethink their patterns of interaction.

_Instant Influence_ is a book about motivation. Don’t be deceived by the name — or the subtitle, “How to Get Anyone to Do Anything – Fast.” It’s not about manipulating people to serve only your own ends. Michael V. Pantalon developed this practice over years of coaching practice, and in addition to being effective, it’s surprisingly simple. **Essentially, _Instant Influence_ consists of asking the person to be influenced (yourself or someone else) six questions:**

1\. Why might you change?  
2\. How ready are you to change, on a scale from 1-10 where 1 means “not ready at all” and 10 means “totally ready”?  
3\. Why didn’t you pick a lower number?  
4\. Imagine you’ve changed. What would the positive outcomes be?  
5\. Why are those outcomes important to you?  
6\. What’s the next step, if any?

**These are not always easy questions to ask.** The system is designed so that the individual questions are reworded to suit the situation, so “change” would be replaced by e.g. “pick up one piece of laundry” or “look up the number for the dry-cleaners.” Pantalon stresses that it’s important to keep the initial step extremely small, so that it’s easy to contemplate. This allows the “influencee” to think about the “why” without being burdened by the “what” and the “how”.

The other counter-intuitive aspect to this process is step 3. It seems odd to ask the person who just answered a “2” why they aren’t less motivated — rather than asking why they aren’t _more_ motivated — but this paradigm shift is key: you’re now putting the person in a position to defend what (little) motivation they have, rather than defend their position of inactivity. This brings us to…

I found it really profound to adopt an attitude of autonomy, both for myself and for others. In some of your future interactions with others (and with yourself!) try staying focused on the reality that everyone is autonomous and ultimately can and will do what they want. For others, this means letting go of the need to control them. For yourself, it means acknowledging that you have the power to make your own decisions.
