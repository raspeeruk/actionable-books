  ### 4 Key Elements and Drivers to Engagement


  > "If you’re not thinking all the time about making every person more
  valuable, you don’t have a chance."- Jack Welch, former CEO of General
  Electric, Intrinsic Motivation at Work, page 10


  There are four key elements to create engagement. Workers are engaged in their
  work when they have a sense of:


  1.  **Meaningfulness**: The feeling that you are on a valuable mission and
  that your purpose matters in the larger scheme of things. This is driven by:

  2.  A non-cynical climate

  3.  Clearly identified passions

  4.  An exciting vision

  5.  Relevant task purposes

  6.  Whole tasks

  7.  **Choice:** The feeling that you can use your own judgement about how to
  contribute to the purpose. This is driven by:

  8.  Delegated authority

  9.  Trust

  10.  Security

  11.  A clear purpose

  12.  information

  13.  **Competence:** The feeling that you are doing good, high-quality work.
  This is driven by:

  14.  Knowledge

  15.  Positive feedback

  16.  Skill recognition

  17.  Challenge

  18.  High, noncomparative standards

  19.  **Progress:** The feeling that your work is moving forward toward the
  purpose and that you can take corrective action when needed. This is driven
  by:

  20.  A collaborative climate

  21.  Milestones

  22.  Celebrations

  23.  Access to customers

  24.  Measurement of improvement

  ### Think Partner—Not Control


  > "Workers are engaged in the new work to the extent that they are actively
  self-managing at that work."- Intrinsic Motivation at Work, page 38


  Are you engaged in your work? Are your people? The essence of today’s work is
  self-management. This is the defining characteristic of employee engagement as
  well as the source of the intrinsic rewards that drive employee engagement. In
  other words, engaged employees are:


  1.  Committed to a purpose

  2.  Using their intelligence to make choices about how best to accomplish
  tasks

  3.  Monitoring their behavior to make sure they are doing the task well

  4.  Checking in to make sure their actions are actually accomplishing the
  purpose

  5.  Taking corrective action when needed


  So how do you create this? Many managers felt like they were “losing control”
  when they shifted from command and control to worker self-management. A better
  way to think of it is a shift rather than a loss. The workers take
  responsibility for the nuts and bolts decision making while the manager stays
  informed on issues of performance competence and progress.


  You will use less authority and coercion to impose decisions and instead
  provide more information and advice. You will think of your relationship with
  them as a _partnership,_ underscoring the free flow of information between
  leader and team member as they work toward their purpose. _Coaching_ is
  another way of looking at it. As workers take increased responsibility for
  task purposes, they are more likely to welcome or even seek helpful input.

  ### What Do You crave?


  > "What they crave…is the sense that they make a Positive Difference in
  something of value."- Intrinsic Motivation at Work, page 45


  Yes, organizations need profits, but as De Geus is cited “\[they\] **need
  profits the same way as any living being needs oxygen. It is a necessity to
  stay alive, but it is not the purpose of life.**” People suffer when they lack
  purpose. Yet what is presented at every all-associate meeting? Market share,
  profitability? The CFO (Chief Financial Officer) gets the stage, when really
  it should be the CPO (Chief Purpose Officer). Workers are rarely inspired by
  economic purposes involving profit.


  Meaningfulness is about the energy or passion you have for the purpose. This
  may change over time. Having a university-aged daughter who insists that
  everyone in her business class is driven by money alone, I was intrigued when
  Thomas talked about this changing over time. Younger workers, he says, are
  focused on proving they can handle things: work and life. So at this stage,
  their passion is simply showing their competence. But as they begin to realize
  they _can_ do it, they commonly suffer a crisis of meaning. The work feels
  empty. Sound familiar? Thomas also pointed out that people are quick to
  recognize the importance of purpose in their own behavior, but tend to assume
  that others are motivated by economic deals and personal gain.


  Average organizations and people don’t make the effort to identify their
  purpose. Exceptional ones not only identify it, but it is the guiding factor
  in every move. Think of Coca Cola. Their purpose is not to make sugar water.
  Rather, some brilliant marketers decided years ago that their purpose would be
  to share happiness! Brilliant. Their recruitment ads say “Make sharing
  happiness your life’s work!”


  What do your recruitment efforts say? Does your vision express what your
  organization stands for? It should be a statement of an exciting future that
  would be meaningful and worthy.
f_conclusion: >-
  Thomas shows us is that engaging your employees is not a matter of personality
  or charisma. There are specific guidelines or tips to help. When you review
  the four elements of engagement and the five driving forces (listed under the
  The Big Idea), do you see room for improvement in your organization? What can
  you do today to contribute to building those drivers?

> “…a disturbing number of the managers they see are running on empty - low in intrinsic rewards and approaching burnout. I don’t want this to happen to you.” _\- Intrinsic Motivation at Work, page 84_

Employee engagement has become more important than ever. Why is that? What do we mean by employee engagement? And how do we get it?

Maybe it was easier in the manufacturing era of the past. Organizations used two simple devices: centralized and hierarchical control, and detailed rules and procedures. Now, in the service era, we talk about the need to “work smart,” “use judgement,” “take responsibility,” and “apply your intelligence” toward organizational goals. This requires self-management which is the defining characteristic of employee engagement.

The heart of this book is twofold:

1.  What are the intrinsic rewards that reinforce self-management?
2.  How can you and your team increase those rewards so that engagement and self-management flourish?

Kenneth Thomas, a Professor Emeritus of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School, teaches us that self-management begins when you commit to a meaningful purpose. You then choose suitable activities to achieve that purpose, perform those activities, monitor your competence and finally monitor your progress.

Below are three big ideas I garnered from Thomas’ excellent work.
