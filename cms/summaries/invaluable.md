  ### Not So Easily Replaced


  > "But the real question is, ‘Are you invaluable?’"- Invaluable, page 123


  How replaceable are you? I mean in your job – would it be easy for your boss
  or your organization to fill your role with someone who could perform your
  tasks or take on your responsibilities as well or better than you can? This is
  the fundamental lesson Crenshaw teaches us in _Invaluable_, how to become so
  valuable to our teams and our organizations that replacing you would be
  essentially detrimental to the success of the organization. He introduces us
  to his “Invaluable Score,” an indicator of market value in relation to
  position, used to quantify market value and identify factors that individuals
  can improve to make themselves Invaluable. (And once you’ve purchased this
  book, you’re entitled to a free light version of your personal Invaluable
  Score, see [www.InvaluableScore.com](http://www.invaluablescore.com/).)

  ### Valuable Contribution


  > "I mean your actual value per hour and your productivity are connected. Some
  people pride themselves on how many hours they work, not realizing what they
  are really doing is spending time in activities that are just wasting money
  and time."- Invaluable, page 65


  Okay, so now that you know your estimated wage per hour, what’s the value of
  that in terms of contribution to your organization? Is your organization
  getting a good return on their investment for the dollars they’re spending on
  you each hour? And if you’re self-employed, are you seeing a positive impact
  to your bottom line, equal or greater to that calculated hourly wage? Crenshaw
  takes his characters through an exercise called the “Work Time Budgeter”
  (pages 57-59) to identify all the tasks and activities they engage in during a
  regular work day, week, and month and helps them quantify the time and value
  of each activity in terms of contribution to the organization.


  Are they engaging in Most Valuable Activities (MVAs) where they’re using their
  greatest strengths and skills or is most of their time spent in Least Valuable
  Activities (LVAs) where their talents are being misused in non-efficient or
  non-effective areas? The result of this analysis was that Jason, our
  Intern-turned-Marketing-Assistant, was able to pass off some of his LVAs to
  the new Intern, freeing up his time to take on MVAs that his boss, Tracy, had
  identified as LVAs in her role. Jason felt that his talents and skills were
  making more valuable contributions to the organization and Tracy freed up her
  time to take on more strategic and tactical activities to which her talents
  were better suited.


  _Invaluable_ is an invaluable reference for those of us who like tangible,
  quantifiable ways to measure our value to organizations and the world around
  us. The concepts are clear and easy to understand and I felt empowered and
  motivated after calculating my own paltry hourly wage. I like to think my time
  is worth more than that and the value of my contributions makes a material
  difference in the success of those activities I engage in. I’m benchmarking
  today’s calculation against one I’m going to do a year from now. The question
  is, how much will your hourly wage increase by if you make the same
  calculations?

  ### Allow for Passion


  > "Don’t get too discouraged. When I did this exercise my actual value per
  hour was less than a third of what I thought I was worth."- Invaluable, page
  65


  Ever calculated your hourly wage? Even when I was on salary, I spent some good
  time calculating my hourly wage and whether or not I felt like I was being
  paid fairly for what I perceived my value was to the organization paying me.
  Problem with this quick calculation is that I was only taking my annual salary
  and dividing it by the number of work hours in a standard year (2080 hours for
  those looking to do the calculation too, based on a 40 hour work week). This
  math didn’t take into consideration any overtime I did, work I did from home
  or time I spent thinking about work outside of regular work hours. It also
  didn’t take into consideration any time I took off from work, any socializing
  or non-work related activities I did during work hours (of which there weren’t
  many, of course!  or time spent travelling to and from work where I did
  work-related tasks like calling in for conference calls. In _Invaluable_,
  Crenshaw takes his characters through this activity, making sure they take all
  these factors into consideration. And man! Were they surprised when they
  learned what their actual wage per hour was, for time spent in work-related
  activities. Go ahead…if you’re feeling brave…and use the following formula to
  calculate your own wage per hour actually spent working.


  **Step 1:** Calculate the number of hours in a week where work “wins,” even if
  it’s only winning in your head (pages 61-62) – this is the number of hours you
  spend working each week.


  **Step 2:** Take your Annual Salary ÷ 52 weeks in a year ÷ # hours working
  each week calculated from Step 1.


  **Result:** Estimated Hourly Wage


  Surprised?

I don’t know about you but I like things to be tangible, organized and measurable. I have a hard time with generalities and subtlety – how am I suppose to benchmark or compete against something I can’t evaluate with any level of certainty? Even in my reading choices, I find a lot of books that talk about theory, ideas and what needs to be done yet they don’t actually tell me how to go about _getting_ it done. Then I came across the newest book by Dave Crenshaw, titled _Invaluable_. Crenshaw is also the author of [_The Myth of Multitasking_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-myth-of-multitasking/), another book actionablebooks.com has made actionable in the past. Both Crenshaw’s books are actionable, showing us how to tangibly apply the ideas he discusses and make positive changes in our lives and careers. That’s what I especially loved about _Invaluable_…it taught me how to calculate my value. Actually calculate it, using math and spreadsheets and exercises…tangible, specific and measurable…YES!

_Invaluable_ is told as a business fable, introducing us to Jason, a recent Intern-turned-Marketing-Assistant who feels like he’s not being valued for his contribution to the organization. His boss doesn’t appreciate the work he’s doing; she fails to acknowledge his success in one activity before demanding work on another task. He feels that with his education and experience, he’s entitled to greater responsibility and more important tasks in his role. On the other hand, his boss, Tracy, feels like she’s too busy with her own tasks and responsibilities to hand-hold Jason in his role and any additional coaching or mentoring is outside the realm of possibility due to the crushing pressures from her own workload. In _Invaluable_, Crenshaw shows us how these two people, in their individual roles, assess their job functions, their value to the organization and to each other.
