  ### Little things make a big difference in influence


  > "Value is not the key factor in selling or persuasion."- Invisible
  Influence, page 62


  How do people process their feelings and what mental shortcuts do they take to
  make their choices? Little things can make a big difference. After he gives us
  the big picture facts, he offers 52 tips (one for each week of the year) to
  help you influence others more effectively.


  You’ll likely want to read all his tips. Here’s just one tip as an example. Do
  you think people are more motivated by what they will gain or what they will
  lose? In other words, which statement do you think would be more influential?


  a) It’s your choice to join the exercise program. I just worry that your
  health will suffer if you don’t and you will end up immobile like your
  mother.  

  b) It’s your choice to join the exercise program. I just think about how much
  more energy and vitality you will have if you do.


  If you chose a) you are correct. People are much more motivated by what they
  could lose. And this loss aversion is especially true when it comes to safety.

  ### Make sure the tank is full!


  > "Talking to people who are out of units for the day is like talking to loose
  cannons."- Invisible Influence, page 80


  One thing I’m much more conscious of now is context. I was always aware of the
  importance of location on your ability to impact someone. A coffee meeting in
  McDonald’s, for example, will elicit a much different response than the same
  meeting in the tea room at the Ritz! But I hadn’t thought much about the
  impact of the timing of that meeting until Kevin taught me about
  Self-Regulation units (SRUs). Each time we exercise self-control, we burn up
  SRUs.


  It makes perfect sense. I know that I am a much more impatient mommy during a
  late Saturday night bath time after a full day of managing the children. The
  kids know this is not the time to push my buttons.


  I started the day with a full tank. Let’s say 100 SRUs. Managing the kids’
  first squabble at breakfast over who got the pink cup drained a couple of
  SRUs. The self-regulation it took me to turn piano practice into a fun time
  instead of just yelling at them to do it themselves burned a few more. Then
  managing their resistance to getting dressed and out the door on time to make
  it to skating lessons burned a few more. You get the idea. By bedtime, my tank
  was empty.


  Now, think about the people you need to influence. Wouldn’t it be better to
  approach them when they are most receptive; when their SRUs are near full
  instead of near empty? And wouldn’t you be more influential when your tank is
  closer to full? Timing is everything.


  I now am much more conscious to book my most important influential
  communications in the morning instead of the afternoon and avoid at all cost
  the dreaded 4-5pm meeting time slot! The reserves are nearly drained by then!
  The front end of the week is also better than the back end.

  ### The birthplace of influence is in what you expect


  > "Invisible influence begins with an Expectant Mind and it stops without
  it."- Invisible Influence, page 13


  Kevin says it is the funniest thing in the world to watch people say “Here’s
  the script, just do this and you’ll get this result.” Why? Because what the
  person thinks and how he/she feels speaks volumes! Their expectancy will speak
  much louder than their words. “Exact words will ultimately fail,” he said.


  I work with pharmaceutical professionals. For years, training departments have
  tried to script their sales people. If only they say exactly what we tell
  them, they’ll win the business. But they don’t. It hasn’t worked.


  How the other person will respond to you is created in your mind first. What
  you tell yourself about why you are there and the difference you will make
  will impact your success tremendously.


  Imagine the different impact the following two professionals have.


  **Professional A:** Believes he is sales rep visiting the doctor to get her to
  write more prescriptions so he can increase the market share in his territory
  so he can win his bonus. He expects that he is going to be a bother to the
  doctor and she won’t want to spend much time with him.


  **Professional B:** Believes he is a partner to the health care professional.
  He is there to help the doctor make the best choice for her patients so the
  patients will have the best outcome possible. He expects that he can help the
  doctor and they will have an interesting and useful conversation.


  Which professional will be more influential? Do you see how the ‘expectancy’
  will speak louder than words?


  This expectancy begins by getting in touch with the difference you will make
  to the world. The importance of focusing on your _why_ has been discussed by
  many authors including, Simon Sinek (the most notable of late) in his popular
  TED talk and book [_Start With
  Why_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/start-with-why/).
f_conclusion: >-
  Of course reading all of Kevin’s 52 tips at once won’t change your behavior.
  Hogan suggests you write down one at a time and keep it somewhere you can see
  for one week. Practice it for that week. Then write down the next one.
  Continue until the technique becomes a part of your unconscious processing.
  Oh, and do it on a post-it note. He references a study that shows
  communications with post-it notes elicits more responses than those without!
  Just another little tip that can appear invisible but make a noticeable
  difference!

You will only want to read Kevin Hogan’s book _Invisible Influence_ if you need to influence people around you. If anyone just excused him/herself, let me know. I’m curious to know who in this world does not have to influence anyone around them.

For those of you still with me, imagine you are going into an important meeting. You really want the person across the table to not just love your ideas, but to buy into them and sign up! You know all the features and benefits and you’ve memorized your script. Ready? Wait! Stop!

Most people fail to influence because they don’t take into consideration the many variables that sit outside of what you say. It’s not in the script. Nor is it in the value of your offering. Kevin Hogan summarizes the scientific discoveries that reveal unique approaches to influence others. There are things you should do and should not do, well beyond what you say.
