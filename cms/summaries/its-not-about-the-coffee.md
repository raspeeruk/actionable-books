  ### Battle of the Gods


  > "The Greeks worshipped both Apollo, the god of reason, and Dionysus, the god
  of the activity of life. The two forces have forever been linked in a paradox:
  nothing happens unless you do something, yet whatever you do needs to be
  thoughtfully considered."- It’s Not About the Coffee, page 123


  We need to think carefully about what we do, we need to do it, and then we
  need to think carefully about what we did. It’s an extremely basic message,
  yet Behar shares some insights that makes it absolutely worth exploring again,
  and in some detail. Behar, Schultz and the Starbucks management team believe
  fervently that in order for an organization to be successful, the individuals
  it employs need to be successful. And success, as Behar reminds us, comes from
  being passionately engaged in your work, understanding the reasons for your
  commitment and dedication, and then taking pride in the outcome.


  As Behar suggests in _It’s Not About the Coffee_, and as we’ll discuss in the
  Insights, there are three stages to personal and professional growth:
  **Challenge**, **Crisis** and **Catastrophe**. Two out of the three, it turns
  out, are directly tied to the timeless balancing act of **Action** and
  **Thought**.

  ### Creating Crisis


  > "A crisis often results when we fail to decide on a direction; a crisis
  compels us to make the decision to commit to a new direction."- Laurence
  Boldt, as quoted in It’s Not About the Coffee, page 129


  I love this quote. It takes the ownership of stress and puts it precisely
  where it belongs – on us. Stressful situations are the world’s way of forcing
  us to make a decision. When things are relaxed and running smoothly, the need
  for us to make directional changes in our lives is low. Why rock the boat?
  Things are going well as is. But ‘going well’ does not mean we’re working
  towards our dreams, towards creating our best life possible.


  To define crisis, we look again to _It’s Not About the Coffee_, where Behar
  defines the “Three Cs of the Human Condition”:


  _“We take on Challenges; we create Crises; Catastrophes befall us.”_


  We create crisis in our lives when we enjoy the ‘smooth sailing’ for too long.
  Growth, as we’ve discussed in past summaries, comes only from change. Change
  comes only from experiencing and tackling ‘newness’ (i.e. challenges). When we
  get too complacent in the plateaus of life, crisis is the way in which we are
  forced back on course to pursuing greatness. We get backed into a corner,
  where the only way out is to change and grow in a new direction. It can be
  painful, stressful and generally unpleasant. We can dramatically minimize the
  crisis points in our lives by proactively seeking out change and growth on a
  regular basis. Certainly enjoy your successes. Absolutely enjoy the view from
  your newly acquired plateau. Take a time out to reflect on and enjoy the
  moment. Eventually though, it’s time to start climbing again; start climbing
  or start sliding down hill.

  ### The Right Challenge


  > "We push people to see what really matters to them – not just
  professionally, but personally. Starbucks isn’t for everybody. No organization
  is. If you’re not able to work on your dreams, if you’re only working on work,
  you’re not in the right place."- It’s Not About the Coffee, page 43


  If you’re an employee, I encourage you to ask yourself this question: What
  does your day to day look like? Are you working towards your own dreams? Are
  they aligned (at least for the time being) with the goals set out for you in
  your current work environment? Are you able to support your own desired future
  while benefiting the company you represent? Or are you simply showing up for
  work, and working for the sake of a paycheque? Behar’s message reads loud and
  clear as this:


  1.  The companies worth working for (truly great companies) have ambitious
  goals.

  2.  To succeed in those companies, you’ll need to take on daunting challenges.

  3.  If your heart’s not in the challenge (because it doesn’t match your own
  life purpose and ambition), you’re not going to last long with that company.


  We live in a time of unparalleled opportunity. Gone are the days of giving
  thirty years to one company and trusting them to provide you with all your
  life’s desires. That culture has been replaced by one of virtually infinite
  job descriptions and opportunities and yet, it comes with a catch. Now, more
  than ever, we need to be in control of our own destinies. No one else is going
  to manage your career (or your life for that matter) for you. If your daily
  work, and the challenges it entails doesn’t get you excited – if it doesn’t
  further your own, personal dreams – it’s time to talk with your boss about
  finding you a role that does. And if there isn’t a suitable role in your
  current organization, it’s time to find an organization that is more aligned
  with your purpose. Look at it this way – if you’re not passionate about your
  work, there’s a good chance you’ll be leaving soon either way. Better to make
  the conscious choice than to have it made for you.
f_conclusion: >-
  _It’s Not About the Coffee_ is a great insight into the makings of a great
  company. Interwoven with anecdotes and a personal memoir, the message of _It’s
  Not About the Coffee_ – that companies exist to further the dreams of
  compatible individuals, and not the other way around – is clear, poignant and
  profound. No matter what the industry, no matter what the company, when it
  becomes more about the product than the people, you’re sunk. There are a lot
  of great companies out there. Find one that fuels your own dreams, then work
  your guts out to make it a reality.

In 1987, Howard Schultz took over Starbucks, a single location coffee house in Seattle, Washington. Over the next 20 years, in an industry fraught with competition and against all odds, Schultz built Starbucks into a global player: the most recognized and geographically stable coffee house in the world. For several consecutive years in the late 1990s and into the new millennium, Starbucks was opening a new location every single workday.

With over 16,000 locations and brand recognition that rivals Nike and Microsoft, you would have to assume there’s something pretty spectacular about their coffee. Reading Howard Behar’s (ex-president of Starbucks International), account of his time with the giant, you’d hardly even realize they made coffee.

Through the pages of _It’s Not About the Coffee_, Behar illuminates the fact that coffee has had very little to do with the company’s incredible growth and sustained success over the last 22 years. Certainly quality product is essential to success, but premium beans are not what Starbucks attributes to its success. For the executive staff at the most famous coffee chain on the planet, it’s all about the people.

Full of great reminders and key insights into the wild success of the company he once championed, Behar uses _It’s Not About the Coffee_ to remind us that success is really attained through the constant balance of two key factors. The advice is so timeless, in fact, that indications of it can be seen all the way back to the Greek empire.
