  ### Leadership is God’s Idea


  > "If leadership is God’s idea, why doesn’t it work better in daily life?"-
  I’ve Got Your Back, page 142


  God could have made human leadership to function the way ants and bees do it —
  where everyone coordinates their own efforts with others for the mutual
  benefit of the group or to have only one leader. Instead He chose to have
  people lead each other in various ways and in various circumstances. This
  method worked perfectly in the Garden Eden. But then it was spoiled by sin.
  The Garden leadership before sin functioned so smoothly it was difficult to
  tell who was leading and who was following (like when you see two exceptional
  dancers dancing together). Here was the first ever leadership failure — Adam
  was right there with Eve and did nothing to stop her (_Genesis 3:6_). And the
  second leadership failure — Eve led the way by first biting the fruit. Then
  Adam blamed Eve and Eve blamed the serpent and forever after people were
  mistrustful of each other (you will desire to control your husband but he will
  rule over you — _Genesis 3:16_).


  Even if you aren’t a Bible student, you know this story. Understanding that we
  as humans are destined to struggle to be effective leaders helps put the daily
  push and pull into perspective. So the short answer is that sin ruined God’s
  perfect leadership method. The long answer is that if it hadn’t happened in
  the Garden of Eden it would have happened eventually because humans lose their
  heads when it comes to power — we either want it or we shirk it and neither is
  good for effective leadership.


  I am currently in a “shirking it” part of my life but that’s after 50 plus
  years of wanting it, working to be effective at it, being summoned by others
  to do it. I’m tired of the work it takes to be an effective leader but
  realized while writing this summary that I must not shirk it. At the very
  least, when I have experience in an area that others don’t I need to step
  forward and put the work in that it takes to do the perfect dance for the good
  of the whole. My ultimate leader, God, has called me to lead in some
  situations. Therefore I must obey.

  ### Why care about being a good follower?


  > "One cannot become a good leader without first becoming a good follower."-
  I’ve Got Your Back, page 153


  How well we follow gives people insight into our character. Galvin says that
  the best leaders are good followers and vice versa. In the book he uses the
  acronym REAL to group a long list of successful follower actions that sure
  look like the character behaviors I want associated with my name. A few
  examples:


  **Responsible** — Helps leader lead well, gives feedback to leader and others,
  does more than asked, takes initiative.


  **Ethical** — Free to follow well and free to leave if can’t follow this
  leader well – but not free to follow poorly.


  **Authentic** — Genuine, humble, views others as human beings bearing the
  image of God.


  **Loving** — Establishes relationship with leader and others, kind, forgiving,
  grace-giving.


  For every verse in the Bible about leadership there are 10 about followership.
  It’s a wonderful resource for examples of how to be a good follower. Much like
  customer service — it’s easier to serve customers if you’ve been one. You know
  what you need and find valuable as a customer. Same with followers — we know
  what we need from a leader and what behaviors we value and find valuable in
  being led.

  ### Creating a successful leadership model


  > "Why do we put up with it…as if what they are doing is acceptable?"- I’ve
  Got Your Back, page 145


  As followers our model of followership is as messed up as our model of
  leadership. We have to, as good followers, speak up about poor leadership in a
  constructive way. Any leader who isn’t a sociopath ([_The Sociopath Next
  Door_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-sociopath-next-door/))
  would be mortified if they learned later that they were leading in a way that
  made you not want to follow. We have a responsibility to tell them, a
  responsibility to help them become a successful leader.


  As we help leaders be successful through constructive feedback, we learn how
  to be better leaders ourselves. Ok, you have the skills to tell the leader
  what he/she is doing that doesn’t make you want to follow but where do you get
  the specific actions to tell them _to do_ instead? I’m a behavioral
  psychologist so I learn best by seeing successful behaviors and replicating
  them. God created perfect leadership before sin and the only person not ruined
  by sin was Jesus. Jesus is a great example but He led so effortlessly that we
  have trouble seeing it and therefore learning how to lead from it.


  The easiest to replicate list of great leadership behaviors I ever saw
  compiled was in a session 12 years ago titled, “Inspiring Like Jesus”. In
  groups on flip charts we listed behavior after behavior along with a specific
  example of each of Jesus inspiring people. Then we posted all the groups’
  lists on a website so each group (and people who hadn’t been at the session)
  could add more inspirational behaviors to their leadership list. I still hear
  from people who are successfully applying these behaviors!
f_conclusion: >-
  Galvin makes a convincing case that the essence of leadership is helping
  people follow. The book ends with lots and lots of ideas on how to spot good
  follower actions and what to do and how to help those who aren’t exhibiting
  them. And we might as well learn to follow well ourselves because in addition
  to it making us be a better leader, we will be in a follower role everyday in
  some part of our lives for the rest of our lives.

> "Leadership is really a particular form of followership." _\- I’ve Got Your Back, page 1_

Biblical leadership starts with being a good follower. James Galvin, author of _I’ve Got Your Back: Biblical Principles for Leading and Following Well,_ does a really interesting job of showing the truly essential interdependency of following and leading.

He says we’ve too often met leaders who demean, defraud and disappoint us as followers — he calls this follower abuse. We’re just looking for a leader we can trust! Because of follower abuse, our best young leaders are discouraged from stepping into leader roles. So he wrote the book to attract the next generation of leaders to leadership. Originally written in textbook style, the young leaders he had review it gave it a big yawn. What to do to make it easy for them to want to learn from it? The final book became a leadership parable — through story we learn Biblical principles for leading and following well. Then, in the last chapter, Galvin pulls the how-to’s from the parable to help us develop our leadership methodology. Brilliant!
