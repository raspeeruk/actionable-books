  ### Tell Your Story As a Native


  > "Content is king, but context is God."- Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, page 17


  **“Buy one get one free!” “On sale, today only!” “Free shipping!”**


  Traditional marketing is all about right hooks–asking people to come buy your
  stuff. And that makes sense. What else are you supposed to do when you’re
  trying to sell things? _Well, a lot actually._ And that’s what Gary’s first
  two books were about–building relationships through social media–because
  **people buy from those they have a connection with, or who have helped them
  out**, and that’s what the platforms are designed to do. Now, once you have
  those relationships, how do you go for the sell? Very carefully, creatively,
  and precisely unique depending on which platform you are using.


  **The way you might ask someone to check out your product on Facebook is
  different than what you would do on Twitter, or Pinterest, or Instagram.**
  Gary calls it **native content**. You’re being native to the platform, an
  insider, someone who knows how that platform is used and what people are
  looking for. That is when you are mastering the context.


  It comes down to this basic truth: “A great marketing story is one that sells
  stuff,” says Gary. “It creates an emotion that makes consumers want to do what
  you ask them to do.” Great storytellers are very observant and keenly attuned
  to their audience. They know when to speed up for comic effect or slow down
  for dramatic impact. There’s a science to it all, and Gary has figured out the
  formula.


  **What’s interesting is that a few years ago these social networks didn’t
  exist; now they have their own culture and language.** It’s like new countries
  have emerged (bigger than most existing ones) and Gary is trying to teach us
  the language and local customs. He has become a native to them all.

  ### Listen Well on Twitter


  > "There’s a lot of talking and selling on Twitter, but not enough engagement,
  and that’s a travesty, because Twitter is the cocktail party of the Internet –
  a place where listening well has tremendous benefits."- Jab, Jab, Jab, Right
  Hook, page 85


  **Gary talks about Twitter with the same affection as he talks about his
  children**, because it has had such an impact on his life and business. It was
  perfect for his cocktail party personality of short bursts and quick
  conversation.


  He says, **“Breaking out on Twitter isn’t about breaking the news or spreading
  information – it’s about deejaying it.”** What he means is that people want an
  entertaining spin on the information, a definite opinion or angle that will
  get people talking. Everyone else is just breaking the news.


  The key to ‘listening’ to what people are talking about is to use Twitter
  search and find subjects that are relevant to your business, or to use the
  trending topics and spin them into your story. Gary says it’s “the only
  platform where you can jump into a conversation unannounced and no one thinks
  you’re a stalker.” **It’s a marketer’s dream because you can connect directly
  with your customer and yet still be visible to the whole world.**

  ### Storytell on Facebook


  > "On Facebook, the definition of great content is not the content that makes
  the most sales, but the content that people most want to share with others."-
  Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, page 32


  Gary talks about three forces that have made it more difficult to share
  content on Facebook:


  1\. The masses  

  2\. The evolution of the masses  

  3\. Facebook’s response to the evolution of the masses.


  **With more than a billion users creating content how can you possibly stand
  out?** Plus, as people’s interests evolve over time, as their life experiences
  change, how does Facebook keep all that information relevant? **Answer:** An
  algorithm called EdgeRank.


  Every interaction you have with Facebook (posting, liking, sharing or
  commenting) is called an “edge,” and the more you have with certain items, the
  more they show up in your newsfeed. Currently, the algorithm does not consider
  click-throughs or any other action that leads to sales. So even though you may
  get a lot of sales from a particular post, that doesn’t help it get seen by
  more people.


  Gary’s recommendation is to **effectively jab, jab, jab on Facebook with posts
  that are likeable, share-able, and generate a lot of comments.** Give
  generously and entertain, so your customers feel like you get them. Then, when
  you post a right hook, a call to action for a purchase, they’ll gladly want to
  be a part of your story.


  On Facebook, I always like joining a conversation by commenting and giving
  people a boost, but I need to do a better job of telling my story in a way
  that’s fun and engaging for the people I want to connect with.
f_conclusion: >-
  There’s so much more information Gary covers, such as promoted tweets and the
  skill to using the right hashtags, along with similar details about the other
  platforms such as Pinterest, Instagram, and Tumblr, that I can’t even begin to
  cover. But I’ll be applying the wisdom I’ve learned from Gary on a few of
  them.

> "Your story isn’t powerful enough if all it does is lead the horse to water; it has to inspire the horse to drink, too." _\- Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, page 11_

_Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_ is the latest book by Gary Vaynerchuk and the third in a trilogy of the evolution of social media. His first book, [_Crush It!_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/), explained what great content should look like and introduced new, strange platforms that are commonplace today. Gary’s second book, [_The Thank You Economy_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-thank-you-economy/) could have been called, _Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab, Jab_! because it was all about building relationships and setting up the environment where the ‘ask’ or ‘right hook’ would be easy and lead to high conversion.

Even though he still believes strongly in those concepts, he felt he hadn’t taught people well enough how to deliver effective right hooks (or ‘asks’) for a sale, which he and his team at VaynerMedia have learned so much about this year. So he just had to write this book. He calls it a “mash-up of the best elements of [_Crush It!_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/) and [_The Thank You Economy_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-thank-you-economy/) with a modern-day spin, it offers a formula for developing social media marketing strategies and creative that really works.”

The bottom line is to **stay true to your own personality, voice and story as you use these platforms** in the way each of them works best. And after reading _Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook_, you’ll know what those are.
