  ### Have “Jack-like-Passion”


  > "After all, business is a game."- Jack: Straight from the Gut, page 267


  In reading the 451 pages of _Jack, Straight from the Gut_, I wish I had kept
  track of the number of times Welch refers to “passion”. Jack describes passion
  as the number one trait he looks for in new hires. He credits his own rapid
  advancement in GE to passion. He makes it clear that passion is the driving
  force behind all success. Employing over 300,000 people, the GE business model
  uses an A, B or C ranking for all employees to determine who’s on the “watch
  list” to move up in the corporation. In Jack’s words: “The As are people who
  are filled with passion, committed to making things happen, open to new ideas
  from anywhere, and blessed with lots of runway ahead of them. They have the
  ability to energize not only themselves, but everyone who comes in contact
  with them. They make business productive and fun at the same time.”


  It doesn’t matter if you work for a major corporation like General Electric,
  or a start up of 5 people. The key to success in any business is passion.

  ### Set the Drumbeat


  > "Making initiatives successful is all about focus and passionate commitment.
  The drumbeat must be relentless. Every leadership action must demonstrate
  total commitment to the initiative."- Jack: Straight from the Gut, page 299


  It’s absolutely true that the speed of the pack is determined by the speed of
  the leader. You need to have clearly defined goals and rewards for hitting
  those goals. Once those are defined however, you need to make clear to your
  team (however you define “team”) what those goals are and how important they
  are to hit. You need to hammer the point home, every chance you get. A
  national sales manager I used to report to used to incorporate our nationwide
  goals into the signature of his email address; “60 in ’07,” or “See you at
  President’s Banquet”. The point is to stretch the mindsets of those around you
  through repetition and focus.


  Know what your goals are, and then become your organization’s biggest
  cheerleader.

  ### Celebrate Everything


  > "After each promotion, she and the kids would celebrate by decorating the
  house and driveway with colorful streamers."- Jack: Straight from the Gut,
  page 39


  Jack Welch had fun in everything he did. He loved his work, and he loved to
  celebrate accomplishments; all of them. With his family he celebrated his
  personal accomplishments (promotions, successful projects, even golf wins).
  With his team he celebrated the projects, his staff accomplishments and major
  milestones. He worked extremely hard at everything, but made sure to take time
  out for reflection and enjoyment. We can all learn something from that.
  Anything worth working hard at is worth celebrating; along the way and at the
  “end”. Make sure you take time out to reward your hard work. You don’t have to
  buy a new car to celebrate either. Being a bit of a music junkie, I used to
  reward myself with a CD purchase every $10,000 in sales I hit. It’s amazing
  how much sweeter victory is when you have a reward for yourself at the end.
  Have fun with everything you do – life’s too short to wait until retirement to
  enjoy yourself.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Jack: Straight from the Gut_, is an eye opener. It’s a fresh and inspiring
  look into big business and the surprising story of an entrepreneurial minded
  man who succeeded in revolutionizing a 100 year old corporation. Jack Welch is
  loud, brash and in your face; the complete “anti-corporate” that, on a
  superficial level, you would never imagine running a global player like
  General Electric. Read 15 pages in though, and you realize there’s more the
  Jack Welch than ranting and extreme competitiveness. He believes in human
  beings. He believes in honesty, integrity and the pursuit of excellence. It’s
  his values that make Jack a winner. It’s his unwavering faith in himself and
  those around him that have made him the legend that he is today. He may not be
  “CEO material” on paper, but then again he may have redefined what “CEO
  Material” is. More than anything, he’s comfortable being himself. We should
  all take a page from Jack’s book. Life’s too short to live it any other way.

For those who aren’t aware, Jack Welch was the president and chairman of the board for General Electric during the 80s and 90s. He has been identified as one of the most influential people of the twentieth century and was named “Manager of the Century” by _Forbes_ in 1999. He’s a formidable business leader who came from (extremely) humble beginnings. He’s the true American success story, and his autobiography _Jack: Straight from the Gut_, is an insightful look into the qualities and attitudes of a winner.
