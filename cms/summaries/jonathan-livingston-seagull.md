  ### Eliminate fear, boredom and anger


  > "Jonathan Seagull discovered that boredom and fear and anger are the reasons
  that a gull’s life is so short, and with these gone from his thought, he lived
  a long fine life indeed."- Jonathan Livingston Seagull, page 26


  The story of Jonathan reminds me of the millions of people around the world
  that have trouble appreciating life and living it to the fullest. It’s easy in
  a country of luxury and abundance to find yourself in a rut of the day-to-day
  activities and more and more challenging to appreciate what you have. It’s
  common for people to be angry about their circumstances or just accept their
  station in life. And it’s no surprise that many people want some sort of
  change but fear making a move for something better or different.


  When Jonathan was cast out of his flock, he was no longer in danger of getting
  stuck in the day-to-day boring life that he saw the other gulls living. He had
  no fears and he chose to live a life where he challenged himself, and thus was
  never bored even though he was a solitary bird.


  The best lesson that I can learn and possibly the hardest one to put into
  practice, will be to eliminate fear, boredom, and anger from my life as much
  as possible. Jonathan found the freedom to let go.

  ### Finding your tribe


  > "There was as much to learn about flight in this place as there had been in
  the life left behind him. But with a difference. Here were gulls who thought
  as he thought."- Jonathan Livingston Seagull, page 43


  During Jonathan’s time as an outcast, he is totally alone. He teaches himself
  to fly better and faster through trial and error. Once he’s learned all he can
  teach himself, two birds come to take him higher and he moves on to his next
  life where he finds birds like him and discovers that there is even more to
  learn about flying.


  We all long for others that we can identify with. Some people seem to fit in
  everywhere they go and some people have trouble finding a tribe they can truly
  feel comfortable with. When I’ve made transitions in my life (moving to a new
  city, changing jobs or roles, graduating), I’ve most appreciated finding a new
  group of people that are like me in my new space. There’s a comfort in being
  confident in who you are and finding others that can identify with you, accept
  you, and challenge you in the ways you need to be challenged to grow.

  ### You are your own teacher


  > "You don’t need me any longer. You need to keep finding yourself, a little
  more each day, that real, unlimited Fletcher Seagull. He’s your instructor.
  You need to understand him and to practice him."- Jonathan Livingston Seagull,
  page 90


  When Jonathan came back to earth, he helped many gulls who had been like him
  break from the conformity of the flock. They came to depend on him to lead
  them but there are two lessons we can learn from Jonathan about leadership.
  Many people need a kick start from a leader for guidance and a nudge to get
  out there and take the first steps. The first lesson is to lead and encourage
  others to make the move to do something different. The second lesson is to
  give them ownership of where they are going. As Jonathan does with Fletcher
  Seagull, once they have started they can be their own leaders, their own
  teachers, and they can grow themselves and others. It’s important to give them
  those nudges.


  I’ve spent much of my career in sales and recruiting getting people started
  with nudges and then guiding them once they have started their own journey.
  I’m in a new role where I don’t get the same natural space to be a leader so,
  like Jonathan, I’ll have to look for a place to go (or return to) to stretch
  my leadership wings once again.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Jonathan Livingston Seagull_ is a story about breaking out of conformity for
  the sake of conforming. It’s about finding freedom from routine and finding
  the teacher within you. Ultimately, you have the power to live the life you
  want to live. So fly higher, fly faster, and live longer.

  Look with your understanding, find out what you already know, and you’ll see
  the way to fly."

> "Don’t believe what your eyes are telling you. All they show is limitation. Look with your understanding, find out what you already know, and you’ll see the way to fly." _\- Jonathan Livingston Seagull, page 90_

_Jonathan Livingston Seagull_ is a story of looking inside yourself to grow into who you are. It’s a fun short read about a seagull that is cast out from his flock for focusing too much on learning to fly faster and better. Most seagulls only fly to live, but Jonathan thinks they should live to fly and fly better and better.

The book is broken into three parts. Part One talks about Jonathan’s life with the Flock, how he is cast out to live alone among the far cliffs, and how he teaches himself to fly. In Part Two Jonathan goes on to another life where he finds birds that are eager to learn, just like him. In Part Three, Jonathan returns to earth to teach birds from his old flock how to break conformity and learn to fly.

The book has a religious undertone to it, but not for a single religion. It makes reference to heaven and other lives, but it also has a Zen quality, urging readers (and seagulls) to find peace within themselves through personal growth.

### You are your own teacher
