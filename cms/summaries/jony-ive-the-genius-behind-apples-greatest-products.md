  ### More than just cool colors


  > "What made the original iMac cool was not its color or shape. It was Apple’s
  demonstrated willingness to open the possibilities of Internet computing to an
  audience that had been ignored by the brainiacs who design PCs."- Jony Ive,
  page 134


  Starting with the iMac in the late 90s, Apple began to think differently about
  who its audience was and grew that following in a brand new way. Jony’s iMac
  focused on the needs of the consumer, which was unprecedented in the computer
  or even the electronics world. PCs were made to do what they needed to do in
  business and designers were tasked with covering the machines in plastic to
  protect the hardware. “The advent of the iMac meant ‘office products \[were\]
  being marketed to teens.’”


  I work behind the scenes in recruiting and my company recruits students.
  Essentially our “customers” are people aged 17-25. So what are the needs of
  the student looking for part time work? There are several that we already
  inherently meet in our program. Conversely, a huge influencer on the college
  students of today are their parents. Over the last several months my team has
  started to think about how to incorporate parents into our recruiting and
  advertising strategy. This book confirms for me that we are headed in the
  right direction of thinking differently about our audience and ultimately
  adding an audience.

  ### The art is in the simplicity


  > "We do everything we can to simplify design… When you look at it now, it
  seems so simple, it seems so obvious, and yet again, the simplest, most
  efficient solution has been the most elusive."- Jony Ive, page 190-191


  I’ve heard for years that Apple products are simple and intuitive. As a
  relatively new Apple user, I don’t always think the interface is intuitive
  (although it could be the Microsoft applications that I’m using on an Apple
  product due to corporate compatibility requirements). While I don’t always
  love the user interface, I can’t argue with the simplicity of design. Smaller,
  sleeker, lighter, faster. These are ALWAYS adjectives that are used in
  conjunction with Apple. So I’ve begun to ask myself how my team and my company
  can simplify some of what we do, what we create, and what we say? I will do my
  best to incorporate a “less is more” approach in my work.

  ### He found the “I” in team


  > "Jony is very protective of his design team… ‘He’ll take the blame
  personally for screw ups … He’d fall on the sword for the weakest part of the
  design.’"- Jony Ive, page 170


  Jony is considered the genius behind many of Apple’s most innovative products.
  While he has won many, many awards for design he never hesitates nor forgets
  to give credit to his whole team. I’ve seen many leaders give credit where it
  is due and thank their teams for hard work, dedication, and inspiration. What
  I haven’t often witnessed are leaders that will take the fall for mistakes
  their team makes.


  “Falling on the sword” for your team is the most noble form of leadership. In
  a world that is increasingly becoming a place where you must always defend
  actions and mistakes, I can’t think of a better way to take care of your
  people and show them how important they are than to take ownership of the
  mistakes as well as share the credit for the victories. Jony has such a good
  team because he is an amazing leader. If the only thing that I remember from
  this book is to protect my team by falling on a few swords, it was more than
  worth the read.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are many more takeaways from Jony Ive than I could discuss here. While
  my company may never be as widely known as Apple for innovation and thinking
  differently, it doesn’t mean that we can’t put a little Jony magic into our
  operations. While I was fascinated by the design talk in the book, that’s not
  what I covered here. I would LOVE to hear what other readers find fascinating
  about Jony and his designs and how they inspire you to be different.

  "The care the machine’s designers took to shape the whole user experience
  struck [Jony Ive]; he felt an immediate connection to the machine and, more
  important, to the soul of the enterprise. It was the first time he felt the
  humanity of a product."

> "The care the machine’s designers took to shape the whole user experience struck \[Jony Ive\]; he felt an immediate connection to the machine and, more important, to the soul of the enterprise. It was the first time he felt the humanity of a product." _\- Jony Ive, page 28_

I was hoping for inspiration from _Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple’s Greatest Products_, and inspiration is what I found.

I was never an “Apple person”, although my company laptop is a MacBook Air. While I don’t shout about the products from the rooftops, I have respect for the products, engineering, design, and seemingly cult following of Mac and Apple devices. I was excited to read about Jony Ive, the creative genius behind many of the iDevices and where the innovation came from.

Below are some of the areas of inspiration I found from Jony. I hope you read about him and find your own inspiration as well.
