  ### Tear Down the Walls


  > "Most workplaces zap energy because they are bland, prefabricated setups.
  These spaces diminish interactions with their physical barriers and closed
  doors."- Joy, Inc., page 36


  Sheridan surmises that the “quiet and lifeless” offices in modern companies do
  more to stifle creativity and innovation than anything else. We are closed off
  from one another, and our buildings are silent.


  In contrast, Menlo Innovations intentionally removed all walls, cubicles, and
  private offices. Replacing separate workspaces with dozens of moveable tables,
  Sheridan fosters conversation and interaction among his team. And going even
  further, Menlo eliminated private space for the CEO. Sheridan is in the middle
  of his joyful, creative, chaos.


  While change of this scale is often beyond our individual capabilities, there
  are a couple of ideas to keep in mind to support personal joy in the
  workplace.


  *   **High Speed Voice Technology** – Move away from your computer and
  actually talk to your colleagues. Look them in the eye. Have a conversation.

  *   **Walkies** – Get away from your desk and take a walk around the building
  with your colleagues. It doesn’t even matter what you talk about.

  ### High Tech Anthropology


  > "A company doesn’t exist to serve its own people; a company exists to serve
  the needs of the people who use its products or services."- Joy, Inc., page
  108


  Sheridan employs a group of individuals known as High Tech Anthropologists,
  whose primary focus is to identify the one persona who will use the software
  Menlo creates. All design decisions are based upon how this primary individual
  will use the end product.


  This activity of identifying a single persona can be adapted to a wide variety
  of businesses to simplify our work. Knowing your audience is perhaps the
  single most valuable tool to product development and marketing – because
  you’re delivering a customized solution to meet the specific needs of a unique
  individual.

  ### Constant Conversation


  > "\[Q\]uiet work spaces tend to be self-reinforcing. Our manners suggest we
  should not bother people in a quiet environment. The typical cube farm simply
  magnifies the stereotypical social awkwardness of introversion, rather than
  capitalizing on its benefits."- Joy, Inc., page 69


  At Menlo, all work is conducted by teams of two people, sharing a single
  computer, and working together for one week at a time. This pairing creates
  the necessity for ongoing, constant conversation, which actually drives their
  efficiency and innovation. This mandatory collaboration leverages the complex,
  problem-solving capabilities of Sheridan’s team.


  Menlo’s reliance on collaborative teams supports what we learned in [_Creative
  Intelligence_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/creative-intelligence/) by
  Bruce Nussbaum – that innovation is social. This constant communication is the
  clear evidence of an environment conducive to innovation.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Joy, Inc._ made me want to work for Richard Sheridan. And really, who
  wouldn’t want to spend their working life at an organization focused primarily
  on making work joyful? I, for one, want exactly that. But most companies will
  not be Menlo Innovations, where walls have been eliminated and babies and dogs
  are welcome. I’m left with the idea that I can change the way I work within my
  organization, starting with communication, anthropology, and experimentation.

  or profit. Humans aspire to a higher purpose… We’ve found that profit, fame,
  and glory often follow us in this path, too."

> "A pursuit of joy within a business context is not about the pursuit of fame or profit. Humans aspire to a higher purpose… We’ve found that profit, fame, and glory often follow us in this path, too." _\- Joy, Inc., page 9_

In _Joy, Inc._, Richard Sheridan charts his course from an aggressive, fear-filled corporation to the creation of his company, Menlo Innovations. Rather than focusing on some elusive work-life balance, Sheridan concentrates on one audacious, hopeful goal: JOY.

Sharing his experiments, failures, and successes in redefining corporate culture, Sheridan outlines a path toward joy that inspires changes in one’s daily work, as well as across the company. And while this book is ideally geared toward visionary CEOs with a willingness to make drastic changes, there is plenty of useful information for those of us further down the corporate ladder. Regardless of our role in our organization, Sheridan shares several key principles including:

*   **Freedom to Learn** – Learn something new and share it
*   **Make Mistakes Faster** – Experiment often and widely until you find the solution
*   **Observe and Empathize** – Understand who your audience is and what challenges they face
*   **Bet on Your Culture** – Align everything you do internally and externally with your values

_Joy, Inc._ made me want to work for Richard Sheridan. And really, who wouldn’t want to spend their working life at an organization focused primarily on making work joyful? I, for one, want exactly that. But most companies will not be Menlo Innovations, where walls have been eliminated and babies and dogs are welcome. I’m left with the idea that I can change the way I work within my organization, starting with communication, anthropology, and experimentation.

It’s far too easy to rely on email, which serves to distance us from one another, so I’m picking up the phone more frequently to actually talk to people. And while I work remotely across a large territory, I’ve found that by identifying my end-users more carefully, I can create more effective marketing and sales campaigns. But most importantly, I’m trying small experiments in my marketing activities, and learning quickly whether the effort is effective. This gives me the freedom to try something new, elsewhere, until I find what works best. It’s freeing. And joyful.

_What about you? Do you work for a joyful company or have you created one? What recommendations can you make to support a joy-focused culture? Do any of Sheridan’s recommendations resonate with you? Is there something specific you can do to bring more joy to your daily work?_
