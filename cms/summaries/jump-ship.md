  ### Before Making the Jump, Follow These Seven Steps


  > "t’s about living that unlived life. Fulfilling your calling…to leave a
  legacy. It’s about inspiring others to dream crazy dreams — and seeing them
  actually make it. That’s something worth jumping for."- Jump Ship, page 209


  Before making the jump, it’s important to understand where you’ve been, where
  you are today, and where you want to go. You cannot get to where you want to
  go if you don’t define it, refine it, plan it and act on it. Below is a brief
  summary of the author’s seven steps to _prepare_ to jump.


  WARNING: Don’t jump ship before you’ve gone through the steps below.


  **Step One: Define Your Dream Job:** The first step to making a successful
  jump and achieving your dream is having a dream to jump for. There are two
  parts to defining your dream: (1) the no-holds-barred magical world where
  everything is possible, and (2) the reality check where you take your dream
  and carefully consider its obstacles and requirements. Allow yourself to dream
  big. Don’t tone it down. Be true to yourself. If your dream has obstacles and
  scares you a lot, then you’re onto something. Write it down. Consider the
  following questions:


  *   What does it look like, feel like, smell like?

  *   What gets you excited? Energized?

  *   If your bank account had six, seven figures, would you still want to do
  this?


  **Step Two: Refine Your Dream Job:** Re-examine and refine your dream using
  the lens of reality. Ask yourself:


  *   What skills are required and do I have them? If not, can I learn?

  *   What will it cost to pursue this?

  *   Am I willing to do what it takes to make this dream happen?


  The good news is that you’re not locked into any one dream for the rest of
  your life. Like you, your dream will evolve over time. To pursue your dream,
  you’ll need to become an expert on everything related to your dream. Do your
  research.


  **Step Three: Test-Drive Your Dream Job:** This is where you’ll test theory
  vs. practice. Do any or all of the following: _interview_ people who are
  living your dream; _job shadow_; _volunteer_; apply for an _internship_; ask
  for _mentoring_ or for an _apprenticeship_; anything that will provide you
  practical experience.


  For example, if you want to open your own restaurant, you’ll want to work in
  one first to experience the reality of operating a restaurant before opening
  your own.


  **Step Four: Choose Your Dream Job Path:** There’s (1) an Entrepreneurial Path
  or (2) a Career Path. Though the entrepreneurial path has gained popularity
  recently, it isn’t for everyone.


  **Step Five: Create Your Dream Job Plan:** Ask: what are the next three things
  I need to do to bring my dream into reality? Write the three things. Do them.
  Over time, these three actions will change. Move on to the next three actions,
  then the next three. You get it. It’s easier to focus on 3 steps at a time
  instead of one giant blueprint.


  **Step Six: Implement Your Dream Job Plan:** Execute on your plan. Create the
  discipline and accountability to continue doing so. Share your plan with
  family, friends, and mentors. Give them permission to kick your tush if you’re
  not working your plan.


  **Step Seven: Mastering and Mentoring:** This step is unique from previous
  steps, as you are now living your dream. You’re on the road to mastering your
  craft and getting compensated for it. This is where life comes full circle,
  where other folks just beginning to pursue their dreams are reaching out to
  you. Don’t be a jerk. Instead of thinking you’re all that, you have an
  obligation to mentor, advise, and inspire others. Become a lifelong learner.
  This way, you won’t sink into the abyss of laziness and complacency.

  ### Beware the Lure of Entrepreneurship


  > "It’s usually possible to get your dream job — wait for it — by keeping your
  day job."- Jump Ship, page 163


  Entrepreneurship is not for everyone. You think you’re working for yourself
  when in fact you’re always working for someone—your partners, customers,
  clients, employees. If you ignore others then you won’t be making money. The
  author acknowledges that it’s only one way to fulfill your dreams, and the
  other way is through a career path.


  If you enjoy baking, does this mean you have to open your own bakery? Or would
  working as a baker in a bakery provide you the fulfillment of your passion?
  Owning a bakery involves more than just baking: there’s bookkeeping, hiring,
  managing vendors, the list of tasks that are not baking will be long and
  challenging. Working for someone else could mean assuming less risk,
  responsibility and investment on your part while enabling you to do what you
  love. Think about it.

  ### “Shake well. Settling is natural.”


  > "The people we admire haven’t “settled” into success. They got there --- and
  stay there --- because they shake things up."- Jump Ship, page 54


  This transformational adage is brought to you by a Green Goodness juice
  bottle: _Shake well. Settling is natural_. The author had read and obeyed this
  countless times, shaking (salad dressing, juice) bottles unconsciously until
  one morning it clicked—this is the struggle we all face. Left to our own
  devices, it is inevitable that we will settle for something—a job that pays
  the bills, a relationship that’s just OK, etc..


  Is this any wonder when on a physiological level our bodies thrive on
  homeostasis (comes from the Greek word for “to remain stable”)? Anything that
  disturbs this equilibrium causes us discomfort, illness, or death. “Settled”
  becomes our default state of being. With this realization, the author
  encourages us to shake things up on purpose, to break our routine or start a
  new one; do the hard thing. It will take effort. No dream will be achieved
  without shaking things up.
f_conclusion: >-
  If you’re serious about bringing your dreams to life, then this book will be
  your compass. It was difficult for me to resist the author’s goading
  challenges and straight talk. The book forced me to confront myself. _Shipp
  happened_. I’m glad it did. So now I’m working hard on steps three and four.
  If I’m doing what I love, much of it won’t feel like work anyway.

> “You were created to make something of your life that no other person on the planet or in the history of the world ever could. If you don’t do it, it might never be done… your dream dies with you.” _\- Jump Ship, page 13_

Jumping ship (aka quitting your job to pursue your dreams) is a serious decision with massive effects on our lives, and should not to be taken lightly. Josh Shipp, the author of _Jump Ship_, understands this, and writes pragmatically about the subject. Instead of providing a “do-this-and-succeed” map, he shares this book as a compass, a guide on how to bring your dream to life, not in fluffy, hyperbolic, huckster-speak, but with practical step by step instructions that are actionable. He challenges the reader numerous times to bail, to stop reading now, because this book is not for the faint of heart.
