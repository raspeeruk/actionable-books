  ### Real Reason to Believe is Key to Success


  > "Unfortunately, analysis also finds that only 20% of concepts offer a
  significant reason to believe. That leaves 80% that don’t. Is it a coincidence
  that about 80% of all new products and services fail?"- Jump Start Your
  Business Brain, page 88


  Hall explains business development as a synergy of concepts. The Target
  Audience (who) needs the Overt Benefit (what) they are convinced of the
  benefit by the Real Reason to Believe (how) and they evaluate their decision
  to buy on the Dramatic Difference (why) of the Overt Benefit and the Real
  Reason to Believe. What he is talking about in this quote is the failure of
  new businesses to convince potential customers they can deliver what they
  promise.


  Customers are naturally skeptical. When you claim a benefit, they may want the
  reward but they may not believe it is worth the risk. We earn their trust when
  we convince them we can deliver the promise. Hall emphasizes the word “real”
  in Real Reason to Believe because it conveys honesty. Dishonesty in an offer
  can be perceived in a split second or even before you make an offer. Hall uses
  the example of a street vendor selling watches. They may look good and be
  priced low, but something tells you as you walk by that the offer is too good
  to be true.


  So, how do we earn a customer’s trust? Read on to the GEM’s.

  ### Create Internet Credibility


  > "I advise clients that if they are offering your goods or services via the
  Internet, they need to triple their levels of credibility communications to
  achieve the same impact as classic physical retailers."- Jump Start Your
  Business Brain, page 93


  It is difficult to establish consumer confidence when the customer cannot see
  you in person. Hall says, “…the customer has to trust someone or something on
  the end of a phone line. With the Internet, it’s a phone line carrying a web
  page.” Ninety percent of Americans mistrust internet advertising, and
  television advertising did not score much better. Much of the problem is
  overstating benefits, which leaves consumers disappointed and even more
  skeptical of new products and companies. There are also all the
  well-publicized frauds and financial failures. Credibility is hard to
  establish.


  The key to success here is to ensure all the communication with the customer
  supports the credibility of the Overt Benefit and the Real Reason to Believe.
  Throughout the book, Hall talks about matching benefits messages in all areas
  of your business and simplifying it so it’s very clear to the customer.
  Internet-based businesses need to be extra vigilant in this area. It can be
  difficult for customers to navigate and understand the information presented
  online. If they need to contact a customer service rep by phone that
  experience should be consistent, clear and simple or the customer’s confidence
  may be lost.


  Hall suggests watching infomercials. As you watch write down the Overt Benefit
  and Real Reason to Believe. Then, list the elements, words, and visuals that
  communicate and support reasons to believe the benefit promised will be
  delivered. Try turning off the sound and observe how you can still see the
  benefits and the reason to believe. Compare that to a 30-second commercial.
  Ask yourself which product you are more likely to buy. As you practice
  conscious observation of advertising, you will gain a better understanding of
  how to communicate clearly using pictures and words that are focused, simple
  and direct. Be sure your message is not just consistent but also the straight
  truth.

  ### Clarify Your Promise and Deliver


  > "Real Reason to Believe is about credibility and trust. It’s built through
  clear, direct communication. It’s enhanced by a multitude of small acts that
  add or subtract from customers’ perceptions of your trustworthiness."- Jump
  Start Your Business Brain, page 91


  Hall explains that some of the ways a company communicates trustworthiness is
  through demonstrations, testimonials, explanations of how it works, and the
  credentials of the creator. Also, customers have more confidence in your
  company when they have an overall pleasant impression. Courteous service and
  clean buildings build credibility. Sometimes the small things are your
  greatest opportunity for building loyalty.


  Hall compares credibility to a bank balance. “Every time you do what you say
  you’ll do, you add to your trust balance. Every time you overhype, overpromise
  or don’t do what you promise, your account decreases.” To a new customer, you
  start with a negative balance.


  I have a membership to a gym. I workout just about every day even if I do not
  go to a gym and I joined because I was tired of my routine. The gym offered me
  an introductory package with training sessions. I had injured my shoulder a
  few weeks prior to joining, and I thought a couple of sessions might help. The
  benefit I was seeking was variety and instruction to prevent another injury. I
  was skeptical, but the salesperson gave me a clear, courteous explanation and
  offered a short-term commitment. This was an Overt Benefit and a Real Reason
  to Believe, but I was only half sold—they have to make good on the promise.
  What I got was more than I expected. My trainer taught me the right way to
  exercise, gave me variety, and continued to challenge me. He demonstrated a
  high degree of competency and trustworthiness by showing his knowledge but
  maintaining genuine humility. No one knows everything and overconfidence will
  diminish trust. Now over 75 weeks later I am still happy, and competitor’s
  lower prices or bigger promises do not tempt me because this gym has earned my
  trust.
f_conclusion: >-
  I enjoyed this book. I was skeptical at first because the ideas come from data
  analysis. The companies I have worked for often collected and analyzed
  irrelevant information, focused on meaningless issues, and ignored the big
  problems. A large corporation can become locked in inefficiency. This is where
  a nimble entrepreneur has the advantage. An entrepreneur can try new ideas and
  quickly change plans that do not work. You will not find any meaningless data
  analysis or ineffective solutions in this book. This book helps you focus on
  exactly what is meaningful and relevant to your success.

Doug Hall enjoyed a tremendous amount of success with Proctor and Gamble as Marketing Master Inventor before starting his own business, the Canadian based Eureka! Ranch. He invented Merwyn, his computer model for processing scientific data to improve business development decisions. Hall and his team have been extremely successful helping large and small businesses succeed. The average American household uses an impressive 18 products or services they helped develop. In _Jump Start Your Business Brain,_ he shares his formula for success to help small business owners and those who dream of owning a business. As he points out, the average start-up has a 10% to 25% chance of success. The average entrepreneur is extremely hardworking and might work 60 to 100 hours a week. The way to succeed is not to work harder but to work smarter. Following the well laid out plan in this book will increase your chance of success to about 50%. He backs that claim with lots of scientific data.

I decided to focus this summary on Real Reason to Believe, Hall’s Second Law of Marketing Physics. Its importance has increased with consumers and according to Hall; it will _double_ your chances of closing a sale.

Ask yourself the question I ask myself, “Do I have the time, money and energy _not_ to optimize my plans?”
