  ### Buy-in is the secret sauce of successful persuasion


  > "‘Buy-in’ occurs when people move from ‘resisting’ to ‘listening’ to
  ‘considering’ what you’re saying."- Just Listen, page 8


  When you get someone to agree with you about a decision or idea, you’re
  basically getting that person to say, “Yes, I agree with what you’re saying.”
  Nearly all of our communication – business and otherwise – is a process of
  getting through to people to get them to do something different. But as
  Goulston points out, nearly everyone is harboring secrets at the root of their
  resistance. Thus it becomes our job during the conversation to discover these
  secrets in order to get the other person’s buy-in.


  Achieving buy-in means that you must crack the other person’s shell and get
  them to talk a bit more openly. Based on what they tell you, you’ll be able to
  better understand their resistance. To a certain extent, this requires a more
  proactive and strategic approach to communication because you need to move
  them through “The Persuasion Cycle.” This means going from listening to
  considering to willing to do to doing to glad they did it.

  ### 9 core rules of getting through to anyone


  > "So when you encounter problem people, realize that there’s a reason they’re
  behaving the way they do."- Just Listen, page 43


  Although moving someone through “The Persuasion Cycle” can seem challenging,
  Goulston outlines the 9 core rules of getting through to anyone, which are
  easy to implement and demystify the process. Interestingly, several of these
  strategies are actually about _you_ shifting your perspective.


  **1\. Move yourself from “oh f\*@& to ok.”** In order to get through to
  someone else, you have to start with yourself. Learn how to be in control of
  your own thoughts and emotions, which is especially useful for stressful
  situations.  

  **2\. Rewire yourself to listen**. Most of our new knowledge builds on prior
  knowledge, which means we are frequently making decisions based on
  assumptions. Opt instead to open your mind and be critical of what you’re
  thinking.  

  **3\. Make the other person feel “felt.”** Put yourself in the other person’s
  shoes in order to understand their perspective and demonstrate compassion for
  them.  

  **4\. Be more interested than interesting.** Stop thinking of conversation as
  a tennis match, and instead enter conversations curious to uncover something
  interesting about the person.  

  **5\. Make people feel valuable.** It is an innate human truth that people
  want to feel valuable, so if someone is challenging make sure they know that
  you think they’re valuable and important.  

  **6\. Help people to exhale emotionally and mentally.** When stress becomes
  distress, the other person can become unreachable. Focus on calming them down
  and being supportive.  

  **7\. Check your dissonance at the door.** If you perceive yourself to be
  different than how others actually perceive you, it can create barriers to
  communicating with others. Seek to uncover what the perception of you actually
  is.  

  **8\. When all seems lost – bare your neck.** Owning your vulnerability is
  empowering and can make others feel comfortable enough to also be
  vulnerable.  

  **9\. Steer clear of toxic people.** Toxic people can strip you of your
  self-esteem, so it’s best to strip these people of the power to hurt you.

  ### Talk to their human brain


  > "But here’s the thing: When you understand something about how the brain
  moves from resistance to buy-in, you’ll have a huge edge – because no matter
  what your message is, you need to talk to the brain."- Just Listen, page 14


  Although we use usually think of ourselves as having just one brain, Goulston
  reminds readers that technically we have three brains. They are: the lower
  reptilian brain, the middle mammal brain and the upper primate brain. These
  brains overlay each other, but largely function independently. Depending on
  where someone is in “The Persuasion Cycle,” they’ll be tapped into a different
  part of their brain.


  The primate brain is the part that “weighs a situation logically and
  rationally and generates a conscious plan of action”. Goulston suggests that
  the easiest way to connect with the primate brain is to make the other person
  feel understood. This gives them a sense of relief and they are able to relax,
  which allows the primate brain to take over. Generally, what someone says and
  how they are acting will give you clues as to what they need, and in turn you
  can mirror that back to them.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Just Listen_ is an incredibly useful book for just about anyone. Goulston’s
  advice is applicable at the office and in personal relationships. I know it
  will be a well-used reference book in my library whenever I encounter someone
  who is digging their heels into the ground or if I’m trying to close a sale on
  a high note.

  persuade. They encourage. They argue. They push. And in the process, they
  create resistance."

> "Most people upshift when they want to get through to other people. They persuade. They encourage. They argue. They push. And in the process, they create resistance." _\- Just Listen, page 4_

I have vivid childhood memories of arguments with my parents that inevitably ended with me shouting, “You just don’t understand me!” Occasionally, as an adult, I have those moments at work – it’s that angsty teenager resurfacing. Then again, I think we’ve all had those moments at work – where we come tête-à-tête with a co-worker or boss who is so challenging to even have a conversation with, you just want to throw in the towel.

But don’t despair! Mark Goulston says there’s validity to the way each of us feel when someone doesn’t understand or accept our point of view, and that it is possible to persuade that person to our point of view. In _Just Listen_, Goulston draws on years of experience as a psychiatrist and business coach to demonstrate how changing your approach to these conversations – by listening a little more strategically – can translate into buy-in with a big payoff.
