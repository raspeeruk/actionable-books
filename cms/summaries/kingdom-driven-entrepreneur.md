  ### Your business is a change agent


  > "When we view our business through the lens of a change agent, the manner in
  which we conduct business, embark upon collaborations, and create product or
  service offerings become more strategic. Strategic because the end result of
  everything we do as Kingdom Driven Entrepreneurs is to bring honor to God and
  to bring transformation to those we serve through our businesses."- Kingdom
  Driven Entrepreneur, page 24


  The brands that have changed the world all have one thing in common: it was
  about more than the money—they desired to transform the lives of their
  customers. Entrepreneurship is a tool that can be used to challenge the
  strongholds some people may have such as limiting beliefs, procrastination and
  mediocre living.

  ### You cannot do it alone!


  > "A God-given vision for your business is always larger than what you’re
  capable of doing on your own."- Kingdom Driven Entrepreneur, page 62


  Everyone who has ever accomplished work that has been truly remarkable has had
  an equally amazing team assisting them. The one-man show will never be able to
  run a successful business that touches the hearts of many. You will need a
  team that can assist you. Before you draft the right team, you will have to do
  some work to create a compelling vision for your business. The authors present
  three simple steps for how to cast the God-given vision for your company:


  **Prepare**. A business that is built to serve a larger purpose can never be
  accomplished alone. In order to properly implement your vision, you will have
  to take time to fully conceive it and define it in such a way that people can
  quickly and easily identify with it.


  **Make It Simple and Memorable.** Design your vision for engagement. The
  message of your business should be clear and concise so that people can
  remember who you are and what you do.


  **Communicate and Celebrate Regularly.** Don’t keep your vision a secret.
  Identify opportunities to communicate your vision through everything that you
  do in your business.

  ### Comfort is the enemy of success


  > "We cannot afford to allow idleness due to fear or complacency to take
  hold…"- Kingdom Driven Entrepreneur, page 60


  Have you ever wanted to venture into something new and exciting but found
  yourself paralyzed by the thought of everything that was unknown to you?
  **Success is found on the outskirts of your comfort zone.**


  A business that serves a divine purpose will have to cross many unchartered
  waters. The fear of the journey can be overwhelming for those that have not
  properly forged their spirits. The authors encourage their Kingdom Driven
  Entrepreneurs to operate a spirit-led enterprise by feeding their faith
  regularly.


  A critical step to defeating complacency is being proactive, by setting your
  intentions up front for what you desire to achieve for the month. Take care to
  make sure that the activities you focus on in your business are those that
  will drive your business forward.
f_conclusion: >-
  Yoga teaches us that self-actualization is achieved through compassion.
  Developing a business from your heart will drive your desires greater than you
  can imagine. The visions for your business, that you sketch from a divine
  perspective, will propel you to take greater action, achieve greater results
  and surround yourself with a team that can assist you in those efforts. _The
  Kingdom Driven Entrepreneur_ presents viable action steps to assist you in
  developing a greater purpose for your business.

Recently, I started taking yoga classes. As my yoga instructor focuses our breathing through the different poses, he gently weaves tiny bite-sized life lessons into his yoga instruction. He talks often about the flow of energy throughout the body; the attainment of your greatest self through compassion and spiritual awareness. The messages can be summed up into: **love**, **inner peace** and **working toward a greater purpose** rather than personal survival or the attainment of power.

The history books are filled with compassionate leaders who served mankind for a greater good. Does your business serve a greater purpose?

Antonina Geer and Shae Bynes team up to deliver a small yet powerful book entitled _The Kingdom Driven Entrepreneur: Doing Business God’s Way_. The authors map out eight principles on how to start or grow a business driven by a greater purpose.

Have you ever heard a small business owner say that they didn’t want their business to get too big? There are over 7 billion people in this global economy who do not know borders. If a business creates value in the lives of its customers through the products and services offered, why then would the owner not want to touch the lives of as many people as possible? Antonina and Shae challenge the thoughts of the business owner who has yet to realize that their **business is meant to serve a greater purpose** and be of abundance and growth.
