  ### Work Smarter Not Harder


  > "Women expect that if you do really well, someone will recognize your
  performance and will reward you accordingly."- Valerie Jarrett in Knowing Your
  Value, page 37


  Hands up if the above quote sounded like you. Ahhh, I see I’m in good company.
  When I reflect on the various positions I’ve held over the years, I can now
  appreciate how that assumption influenced some of the decisions I made and
  contributed to moments of feeling ‘let down’ by the organization or my boss.


  Working to the best of one’s abilities is something we should all aspire to
  and is something managers should demand of every employee. However, assuming
  ‘The Powers that Be’ will sit up and take notice of your dedication and hard
  work, showering you with unsolicited praise and bonuses, is at best naïve and
  at worst downright crazy (yes, even at the top ranked companies to work for)!
  Which makes me, and possibly you, a naïve, crazy, under-compensated
  professional!


  The ‘ah-ha’ moment here is not so much that managers need to change their
  behaviour (although that would certainly be helpful), it is that we, as
  employees, need to work _smarter_ not harder. We must take responsibility for
  our careers and our pay cheques by drawing attention to the great work we are
  doing and demonstrating how it contributes to the success of the organization.

  ### No Excuses, No Apologies


  > "Because if you don’t demand what you are worth and if you don’t communicate
  it well, you won’t be treated fairly, and the relationship will ultimately
  die."- Knowing Your Value, page 9


  Another interesting observation made by Brzezinski and the women she
  interviewed was that women tend to be more ‘emotional’ in how they dealt with
  different business situations whereas men are more matter-of-fact. Women are
  more apt to value being liked, more likely to take things personally, more
  prone to accommodating others rather than insisting on being accommodated. Men
  typically adopt the stance – business is business, take it or leave it. It
  reminds me of Dragnet’s Sgt. Joe Friday and his “Just the facts, ma’am”
  mantra.


  So my ‘No Excuses, No Apologies’ insight reminds me that I should not make
  excuses for why I am not receiving my due (it’s nobody’s fault save my own),
  nor apologize for asking to receive what I feel I am worth _provided I have
  clearly communicated my business case_. If I do my homework and can
  demonstrate the ‘win-win’ for myself and my client, I can more readily silence
  my tendency to personalize the negotiations and the outcomes. Business is
  business and successful businesses are built on strong relationships that are
  mutually rewarding and beneficial. I do not have the time or the energy to
  invest in propping up a weak relationship. Life is too short for that
  nonsense!

  ### Build Your Business Case


  > "What makes a persuasive argument are solid facts and figures about what
  you’ve done and what other people, with the same skills and experience and
  accomplishments, are making for the same job."- Knowing Your Value, page 116


  It should go without saying, however say it I will – there’s a right way and a
  wrong way to negotiate for things. Brzezinski courageously shares the missteps
  she made and the lessons she learned from those experiences: stories of
  apologizing instead of pointing out important victories, of playing the ‘it’s
  not fair/reasonable’ card, and the cringe-inducing story where she adopted an
  aggressive alpha male negotiating stance that was neither authentic nor
  effective. Strategies that failed. Strategies that left her demoralized,
  despairing and self-recriminating. Strategies built on wishful thinking not
  thoughtful execution.


  A more effective way to get what you want is by building a business case –
  assembling the facts and data that describe what you’ve done, how it benefited
  the organization, and how that compares with others doing similar things in
  your organization or industry. Think of it like an annual report card or
  resume. We use the quantification strategy to good effect when crafting our
  resumes yet forget to employ that tactic once we land that dream job!


  I recently used this approach successfully when negotiating with a potential
  client. I contrasted what I could do for them with what other vendors
  typically offer – in terms of content, approach, time and costs. The client
  got a reasonably priced, fully customized workshop and I was fairly
  compensated for my time and expertise. Note to self: repeat this approach!


  Build your business case! Buy a blank journal or create an electronic record
  and spend some time each week chronicling your achievements and contributions.
  Strive to quantify them and the value they generated for your company. Find
  and document industry comparators. Then when it’s time for your annual
  performance review or you decide to ask for a raise, you’ll have all the data
  you need at your fingertips!
f_conclusion: >-
  I selected this book not knowing who Mika Brzezinski is and unaware of the
  MSNBC show _Morning Joe_ that she co-hosts. I selected it because the title
  called out to me. I was curious to learn if it was possible to make peace with
  the ongoing tug-of-war I experienced between what I thought my expertise was
  worth in the market and what I seemed able to command from previous employers
  and paying clients.

> "Knowing the fair-market value of our contributions at work is a critically important piece of knowledge for today’s (and tomorrow’s) professional woman." _\- Knowing Your Value, page 186_

If you read and enjoyed Sheryl Sandberg’s [_Lean In_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/lean-in/), you will probably like Mika Brzezinski’s _Knowing Your Value: Women, Money and Getting What You’re Worth_. Both authors tackle topics of interest to working women and share their personal experiences and insights about the challenges of finding their way in corporate America in the 21st century.

I’ve always been fairly confident about my skills and expertise, and the value I bring to the workplace. Yet I have always struggled with the monetary side of the equation, especially the process of negotiating remuneration to match what I think I’m worth. According to Brzezinski and the many high profile women (and men) she interviewed, I’m not alone. And while my first reaction is to say that _all_ professionals, both women and men, need to know the fair-market value of their contributions at work, Brzezinski convinces me that women are further behind in this regard compared to their male counterparts. I also discovered that not only do systemic factors conspire against me, I unknowingly conspire against myself!

While the book wasn’t quite what I expected, it was an enjoyable read and I found myself nodding in agreement with many of the observations made by the highly successful women whose experiences Brzezinski shared throughout the book. And although I can’t say that I’ve fully vanquished my value vs. compensation conflict, I’m confident I can manage it better. I can and will be more deliberate at working smarter not harder, building solid business cases, and banishing excuses and apologies from my vocabulary!

Have you struggled to define your value and get paid what you’re worth? What advice can you share on how to negotiate compensation that reflects and values your expertise?
