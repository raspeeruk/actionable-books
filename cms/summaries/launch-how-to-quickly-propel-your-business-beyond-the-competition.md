  ### The Elevation Principle


  > "If you lift people up, they’ll help lift you up."- Launch, page 8


  In a nutshell, the elevation principle is: **Great Content + Other People –
  Marketing Messages = Growth**. This is the theory Stelzner puts forward in
  _Launch_ and he makes a compelling case for it being true. He suggests that it
  is the process of meeting the core desires of prospects and customers by
  helping them solve their basic problems at no cost. By taking this approach,
  you focus on building trust and gaining attention without an obvious marketing
  message. This is more or less the complete opposite of traditional internet
  marketing, which is all about pushing the message out to the reader. Moreover,
  this helps a business shift from the “all about us” mentality to one that
  focuses on being of service to others. Stelzner also suggests that this
  facilitates a change in the prospects mind from “I’m being sold” to “I’m being
  educated”.

  ### Other People Will Take Your Business Places


  > "Remember, it’s people who take your business to new places. When you give
  them what they want, your business will grow."- Launch, page 92


  This takeaway ties back into the The Big Idea of this book, which is the
  elevation principle. As it states, **you need great content and other people
  for growth to occur**. Stelzner outlines several different groups of people
  that are necessary for the elevation principle to work. Chiefly, your reader
  base, outside experts and fire starters. In the case of each group,
  relationship building and reciprocity are key.


  **Your gift to your reader base will always be your content.** In addition to
  that, you might provide them with other gifts that help them solve their
  problems. This could include a free webinar, a template, an e-book, etc.
  Stelzner states that in gaining people’s trust and demonstrating how valuable
  you can be, you will create a larger, more loyal pool of prospects. **If
  you’re looking to build your readership, then you have to focus on the other
  two groups: outside experts and fire starters.** “Experts bring credibility,
  experience and exposure to your business”, which are key components of growing
  your business from the ground up. Building great relationships with experts
  comes down to the value _they_ find in the exchange – be able to articulate
  this clearly. Finally, fire starters are the people who have so much influence
  that their endorsement can set off a chain reaction that propels your business
  forward. The best fire starters have the eyes and ears of an audience that
  closely matches your ideal reader base.

  ### Use Your Vision as a Filter


  > "What’s your vision? This may seem like a no-brainer concept, but it is very
  easy to lose focus and drift off into space without a clear vision."- Launch,
  page 28


  It is a classic problem for a lot of business owners online. It starts as a
  passion project or a hobby, but then it takes on a life of its own. The
  problem is since it wasn’t started as a business, it can be a challenge to get
  a handle on the long-range view. **In other words, what are all of your
  efforts going towards?**


  Creating a vision for your business helps you by painting a picture of a
  desirable future and can guide your business decisions. Understanding what you
  want your future to look like will help you make more informed decisions in
  the present in order to achieve that future vision. For example, your content
  and the gifts you give your readers should be created with the goal of moving
  you closer to your vision. Furthermore, when you have an idea of what the
  future looks like it becomes easier to say no to projects that don’t fit the
  bill. This can be an equally powerful tool that will help keep you focused.
f_conclusion: >-
  One thing that _Launch_ affirmed for me is that there are many moving parts
  and pieces to building a successful online business; my own experience running
  an online business hasn’t been such an anomaly after all. It’s not enough to
  just be creating content in a silo. You have to be committed to the greater
  vision, which usually involves community building. **Perhaps relationships
  really _are_ everything.**

  "When you can hold back the marketing messages from your content, it will take
  your business to unimaginable places. But the idea of restraining marketing
  messages is a difficult pill for most people to swallow. It’s the opposite of
  what many marketers believe to be right and true."

**Have you ever thought about what makes wildly successful online businesses stand out from the crowd?** Michael A. Stelzner, founder of [SocialMediaExaminer.com](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/), does just that in his book _Launch: How to Quickly Propel Your Business Beyond The Competition_.

At its core, this book is really about shifting our approach to marketing. It is a frontier that involves “focusing on the needs of others, giving gifts, working with outsiders and caging your marketing message”. What gets us to this frontier? _Content._

Stelzner makes the case for the fact that people have basic and constant needs such as desiring valuable insights and gaining access to great people and recognition (before purchasing). In this regard, content can become a competitive advantage in the business landscape because it adds immense value to someone’s life, steers us away from overt marketing tactics and builds relationships with a bigger community.
