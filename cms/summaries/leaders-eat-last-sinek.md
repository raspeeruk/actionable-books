  ### Real Status


  > "Those who work hardest to help others succeed will be seen by the group as
  the leader or the ‘alpha’ of the group. And being the alpha – the strong,
  supportive one of the group, the one willing to sacrifice time and energy so
  that others may gain – is a prerequisite for leadership."- Leaders Eat Last,
  page 49


  In so many organizations today, promotion to leadership positions is awarded
  to those who are good at _doing_. It’s always bothered me on a gut level – we
  take our best doers _out_ of the tasks they’re good at. We ask them to stop
  **doing** and start **managing**, often based on nothing more than their
  ability to **do**, well.


  Sinek’s message is that the skills that make for a strong leader – a leader we
  want to follow – have little to do with their ability to complete tasks, and
  instead on other characteristics. Traits like **integrity** and **trust**.


  Sinek does a lot of work with the United States armed forces. Specifically, he
  works with (and takes leadership lessons from) the Marine Corp; one of the
  world’s most effective military forces.


  _“Unlike in the private sector, where being good at doing is often rewarded
  with a position of leading, in the Marines, leadership is also a matter of
  character – not just strength, intelligence or achievement.”_


  Leadership – **true leadership** – is the ability to infuse those who report
  to you with an unshakeable trust in your intentions. Giving them zero reason
  to believe you have anything than your people’s best interests in mind.

  ### You gotta love it


  > "Children are better off having a parent who works into the night in a job
  they love than a parent who works shorter hours but comes home unhappy."-
  Leaders Eat Last, page 32


  If you’re unhappy in the way you spend your work day, it’s difficult to give
  of yourself to the level your people need. Children, spouses, co-workers and
  those who report to you are directly impacted by your own level of happiness.
  It has to do with our feelings of safety (what Sinek calls “The Circle of
  Safety”), which is to say that our stress levels and self-preservation
  tendencies go down when we find ourselves in an environment that we trust is
  built to protect us. When we feel that our leaders are happy, secure and
  working to protect the tribe **because they want to do it**, we focus our
  attention and energy on achieving for the good of the tribe.


  In practical terms, the lesson here is that it’s difficult to expect our teams
  to work towards a collective good if we’re spending a couple hours a day
  looking for another job. To be the most effective leaders we can be, we need
  to commit to being here. We need to find personal satisfaction in our roles
  and move our attention off our selves and onto the best interests of the
  people we lead. This may seem obvious for some, but it’s an important “self
  check” if we feel like those in our charge are self serving. They may be
  taking a lesson from the top.


  _“‘The cost of leadership,’ explains Lieutenant General George Flynn of the
  United States Marine Corps, ‘is self-interest.’”_


  I’m not typically one for military examples, sports examples, or other
  “lessons” to be learned from industries outside the business world. But when
  it comes to leadership and developing strong teams of people who trust each
  other (with their lives, no less), there are definitely things we can learn
  from the armed forces. And, as a relief, the biggest lesson I’ve taken from
  this book is that we don’t necessarily want to follow those who are smartest,
  toughest or most skilled. Instead, the most effective teams – in business and
  the military alike – are led by selfless leaders. Leaders whose best
  attributes are **trustworthiness** and **integrity**; individuals who put the
  needs of the group ahead of personal gain. (The irony, of course, is that
  these “team first” leaders end up with the largest personal gain. It’s a
  bi-product of good leadership though, not the objective.)


  Establishing trust takes time. Building a reputation of integrity takes time.
  It’s not the fastest way to short term profits, and sadly that’s what derails
  so many potential leaders. But, if you’re working in a field you believe in
  and focus on the long term success of your people and your organization,
  leadership isn’t really that complicated. The ability to be a good leader is
  inherent to all of us.

  ### Your most precious resource


  > "We will judge a boss who spends time after hours to help us as more
  valuable than a boss who simply gives us a bonus when we hit a target."-
  Leaders Eat Last, page 119


  Sinek provides example after example (both case studies and insight into how
  our brains process information) of how giving of your **time** is more
  effective – more impactful – than giving of your money.


  It starts from how our brains quantify things. Money is too abstract for us to
  have an emotional connection to it. Of course we all like bonuses, and if you
  ask anyone if they’d like a $5000 bonus or a day learning one-on-one from
  their boss they’d be hard pressed not to say “show me the money”. And yet
  bonuses and raises do little to engender trust or strengthen relationships. By
  all means, give them the bonus. But do not mistake financial reward as a
  worthwhile replacement for time, energy and attention.


  Time is concrete. Since we all have the same number of hours in the day, we
  appreciate the gift of time on a biological level. Sinek uses the example of
  packing up your house for a move: if one friend gave you $5000 towards a
  moving company and a second friend gave a day of their time to help you lug
  boxes, who do you feel closer to? To whom have you developed more loyalty?


  If you want to develop your own leadership credibility, **give your people the
  gift of your time**; as much, and as often as you can.

_“It is not the genius at the top giving directions that makes people great. It is great people that make the guy at the top look like a genius.”_

_–_ Leaders Eat Last_,_ page 18

Five years after the release of his wildly successful _Start With Why_, Simon Sinek is back with his sophomoric book, _Leaders Eat Last._ It’s always with some trepidation that I pick up the follow up to any breakout success. After all, the bar’s been set pretty high.

Thankfully, _Leaders Eat Last_ doesn’t disappoint. In it, Sinek takes the best of what worked in _Start With Why_ – an aspirational message backed by neuro-science – and adds even more weight to his claims through dozens of case studies of both private and public companies. And what is that claim, you’re asking? Sinek’s message is that strong leadership is a **_biological imperative_** in any group situation. That there are specific attributes that human beings look for in a leader, and certain circumstances in which leadership is more natural for us. Here we go.
