  ### Culture is What People Do


  > "A culture is nothing more than the sum of the habits of the people. Culture
  is not what you want it to be – it is what people do on a regular basis."-
  Leaders Made Here, page 27


  Culture is **_what people_** **_do_** **_on a regular basis_**. I’ve added the
  extra emphasis to this statement to underscore both the simplicity and the
  power of this observation. Sometimes I think people lose sight of this truth.
  They envy the amazing culture of high performing companies like Amazon and
  Southwest Airlines and bemoan the soul-sucking culture of their own
  organization like it was the by-product of the air molecules surrounding them
  or an additive to the water source. This disconnect between personal
  behavioural choices and collective attitudes needs to be rectified for so many
  reasons it may well warrant a book all its own.


  In _Leaders Made Here_, Miller reintroduces us to Blake (whom we first met in
  [_Chess Not
  Checkers_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/chess-not-checkers/))
  who has just accepted a new CEO position at a mid-size firm. An unanticipated
  leadership vacancy on the senior leadership team, and no apparent internal
  candidates, motivates Blake to make developing a leadership culture in his
  organization a strategic priority. The first step of that journey focuses on
  developing a common definition of leadership. The remaining steps are all
  about taking action – doing things regularly as an integral part of your job.


  Does everyone in your organization share and act on a common definition of
  leadership? Randomly ask five people what leadership looks like in your
  company. If you get conflicting definitions, you know where you need to start.

  ### Five Steps to Building Culture


  > "To create a leadership culture…Define it. Teach it. Practice it. Measure
  it. Model it."- Leaders Made Here, page 113


  Whether you are trying to instill a culture of leadership, innovation,
  philanthropy or teamwork, the steps are the same… _Define it. Teach it.
  Practice it. Measure it. Model it._ This makes intuitive sense. Tell people
  what you want them to do. Show them how to do it and provide them with
  opportunities to practice it in the workplace. Monitor and measure the quality
  and quantity of the behavioural outputs so you can provide feedback and
  additional learning opportunities. Finally, walk your talk. Act the way you
  want others to act and visibly reward them for adopting the desired
  behaviours. Do these five things consistently and…abracadabra, presto! You
  will have produced a living, breathing, self-sustaining culture within your
  organization.


  However, there is a caveat you should be aware of: these five steps are
  equally effective in establishing toxic, undesirable cultures like
  silo-thinking, self-preservation, apathy, back-stabbing and a myriad of other
  problematic organizational practices. Quite often, these five steps occur
  subliminally; they are not overtly labelled and rolled out as part of a
  ‘corporate program’. They are learned over time by observation, water cooler
  gossip and first-hand experience.


  One of the biggest mistakes any leader can make is believing something has to
  be officially labelled as ‘required’ in order for it to become part of the
  corporate culture. Recall our The Big Idea: _Culture is not what you want it
  to be – it is what people do on a regular basis._ Employees watch and take
  their cues from their leaders and those around them. “Do what I _say_, not
  what I _do_” rarely works. Behaviours are a visible manifestation of
  individual and corporate values. Seeing becomes believing, which in turn
  becomes behaving!

  ### Leaders SERVE (and Serve is a Verb)


  > "When we consider what leaders do, we believe they all serve."- Leaders Made
  Here, page 41


  Robert Greenleaf first coined the term “servant leadership” in an essay
  written in 1970 and which later morphed into numerous books exploring the
  concept. The philosophy developed from a strong belief that individuals who
  grounded their actions in service to others earned the respect and loyalty of
  those served, and naturally cultivated opportunities for greater influence as
  a leader. Contrast this approach with the positional, command and control
  leadership paradigm prevalent in much of the corporate world today. It’s no
  wonder a significant proportion of the workforce is disengaged and operating
  from an ‘us versus them’ mentality.


  Miller clearly believes in servant leadership. Blake’s team eventually adopts
  “**_Leaders SERVE_**” as their shared vision and definition of leadership with
  SERVE representing five actionable behaviours:  


  **S**ee the Future.  

  **E**ngage and develop others.  

  **R**einvent continuously.  

  **V**alue results and relationships.  

  **E**mbody the values.


  Notice that these five responsibilities are not exclusive to individuals with
  formal leadership positions. Anyone, regardless of their job title within an
  organization, who aligns their actions and their communications with these
  five commitments will be demonstrating servant leadership and fostering the
  development of a leadership culture. Which SERVE behaviour can you begin to
  demonstrate more deliberately in your job?
f_conclusion: >-
  In an era where many organizations focus predominantly on improving their
  products, services and profit-margins, companies that deliberately concentrate
  on growing leaders, at all levels of the company, stand to cultivate a
  distinct competitive advantage in the marketplace. Organizations with leaders
  who SERVE are likely to be more agile and responsive to the changing needs of
  their customers and the marketplace. Leaders who SERVE create organizations
  where people enjoy their work and are fully engaged in fulfilling the
  company’s mission with passion and excellence. Leaders who SERVE inspire
  others to do the same, ensuring a ready supply of qualified leaders for
  emerging opportunities within and outside of the company.

  challenge."

> "A leadership culture exists when leaders are routinely and systematically developed, and you have a surplus of leaders ready for the next opportunity or challenge." _\- Leaders Made Here, page 1_

Mark Miller’s _Leaders Made Here_ explores the importance of succession planning as a non-negotiable and foundational component of successful organizations. Sadly, many organizations are so preoccupied with the here-and-now issues of launching a new product, hitting quarterly sales targets and polishing their company image that they leave leadership development to chance. Without a strong pipeline of leaders to draw on, organizations become vulnerable to drifting, stagnation and uncertainty when an inevitable leadership vacancy arises.

Stop and think about your organization. Can you honestly say you have **_a surplus of leaders_** ready to step into your next leadership opportunity and prepared to tackle unanticipated challenges? If you can confidently answer yes, then congratulations. You are fortunate to work at a company that values leadership development and walks its talk. If you answered _no_ or _not sure_, then you may want to keep reading to pick up a couple of ideas that you can implement to get the ball rolling in the right direction.

Transforming an organizational culture is possible yet rarely easy. It will take time, persuasion, perseverance and an unwavering belief that the benefits of developing your people into leaders will outweigh the familiarity of the status quo.

The journey to high performance begins with leadership. As Gandhi exhorted his followers, “**_Be_** the change you want to see.” Are you ready to SERVE?
