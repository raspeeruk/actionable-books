  ### Less management, more leadership


  > "Because management deals mostly with the status quo and leadership deals
  mostly with change, in the next century we will have to become much more
  skilled at creating leaders."- Leading Change, location 2240


  After decades of management in stable times, this is a time for less
  management and more leadership.


  For most of my career, I’ve managed change of one kind or another for
  libraries. In the earlier years, those changes were about introducing
  technology to stable organizations: more of a process of bolting something new
  onto an existing and solid structure. Over time, the technology started to
  drive more significant organizational change: changes in processes, practices
  and policies. In more recent years, the accelerated rate of technological
  change has left many libraries reeling; stability is no longer the norm. While
  good solid management worked in the early years, serious leadership is now
  required to support the profound organizational change that is essential to
  our survival.


  As Kotter notes, successful transformation is 70-90% leadership and only
  10-30% management.


  Leadership is needed to define what the future will look like, to align people
  with that vision, and to inspire people to make it happen despite all of the
  obstacles along the way. It takes leadership to build the new systems, or
  transform the existing ones.


  But leadership involves taking risks, trying new things, being willing to fail
  and learn and try again. The problem is that most of us came up through
  systems that valued management skills – keeping things running smoothly as
  they’ve always run – and this leadership thing is relatively new territory.
  Organizational commitment to lifelong learning, to building leadership
  capacity, and to supporting those who willingly leap into the future, is
  essential. Overly controlling, stiffly bureaucratic organizations are
  increasingly irrelevant.


  Just as organizations will be forced to learn, change and constantly reinvent
  themselves, so too will the individuals who help to move an organization
  forward. For the organization that I lead, it’s clear that developing
  leadership capacity at all levels is essential. Kotter describes successful
  organizations in the twenty-first century as becoming more like incubators of
  leadership – a concept that resonates well with me.

  ### Empowerment


  > "Major internal transformation rarely happens unless many people assist. Yet
  employees generally won’t help, or can’t help, if they feel relatively
  powerless. Hence the relevance of empowerment."- Leading Change, location 1373


  For an organization to do more within its means, a great deal of authority
  needs to be delegated to lower levels than has happened in a previous
  “over-managed and under-led” era. Engaged and empowered employees are needed
  to transform an organization into something better.


  In my experience, major change often demands personal growth, and a commitment
  of both the head and the heart. New social skills and attitudes may be needed
  to support the success of new teams and collaborative effort. All of this
  comes with some emotional work: some letting go of the status quo, coming to
  trust others. Engaging employees at this level requires a supportive
  environment, an organizational commitment to life-long learning, and a common
  goal.


  Kotter makes an interesting connection between leadership and empowerment:
  “Many of the same kinds of organizational attributes required to develop
  leadership are also needed to empower employees.” It’s an observation that’s
  worthy of reflection. My experience is that the delegation of authority
  requires a fair measure of support and conversation.

  ### Change


  > "Few things move easily, because nearly every element is connected to many
  other elements… Changing highly interdependent settings is extremely difficult
  because, ultimately, you have to change nearly everything."- Leading Change,
  location 1855


  Wholesale organizational transformation can become a huge undertaking because
  nearly every element will need to be changed: structures, systems, practices,
  culture and policies all need to be realigned. Training programs, job
  descriptions, and performance evaluation systems may need to be changed.
  Individuals may need to be added or subtracted from the organization. Before
  long, dozens of elements will require change, resulting in multiple and
  interdependent change efforts for every aspect of the organization, and
  requiring years’ worth of sustained and focused effort.


  In my organization, nearly every element has undergone, or will undergo,
  change. Where once our structure was organized by buildings, we’re now
  organized along service lines. Where once all decisions were made by managers,
  decision-making now happens at the level where it makes the most sense. Where
  once the services were designed to be impersonal, we’ve recognized that our
  value is personal and have reoriented our service practices accordingly. Our
  once-thin policies were designed for a former era; now they are extensive and
  robust. Our culture is changing from one that was closed and insular to one
  that is open and welcoming. And as each area is touched in some way, some
  other element comes to light that also needs adjusting.


  Implementing multiple and interdependent change projects simultaneously would
  be impossible for one leader working single-handedly. Dozens of change efforts
  across an organization requires coordinated leadership effort – and the
  participation of all employees.
f_conclusion: >-
  Providing leadership that builds the capacity and supports the growth of
  others, capturing their hearts and minds, is necessary to support successful
  major change. Kotter notes that “Many people try to transform organizations…
  \[by\] authoritarian decree and micromanagement. Both approaches have been
  applied widely in enterprises over the last century, but mostly for
  maintaining existing systems, not transforming those systems into something
  better.”

> "Speed of change is the driving force. Leading change competently is the only answer." _\- Leading Change, location 56_

Given the profound and long-lasting impacts of rapid technological advances and globalization these days, one would be hard-pressed to name an industry that has not had to adapt and change. Certainly in the public sector knowledge economies, the volume, variety, and velocity of information has been a game-changer. For libraries in particular, my world, a mythology that libraries have been replaced by Google and Amazon, and fuelled by intense competition for people’s time and attention, has created the imperative for bold and innovative change.

And while the challenge is to adapt while remaining true to the core mission, what’s needed now more than ever is transformative change. We’re talking about wholesale change – re-aligning structures, systems, practices and culture. Not just moving the deck chairs around.

Consider this: 70% of change efforts fail. In his classic text, _Leading Change_, John P. Kotter describes his eight-stage change process, beginning with “establish a sense of urgency” and ending with “anchor new approaches in the culture”. He provides the steps needed to give your change initiative its best chance of success. But overall, this book is about the work of leadership in times of change.

Both approaches have been applied widely in enterprises over the last century, but mostly for maintaining existing systems, not transforming those systems into something better.”

Given the complexity of wholesale change, leading people through it well – through a sense of urgency; through vision, strategy and communication; through empowerment and culture – will push leaders to be their very best.

And given how long such wholesale change efforts take – from 3-10 years, according to Kotter – just imagine how extensive the leadership capacity of an organization will be strengthened when the change efforts are handled well and sustained over that time.
