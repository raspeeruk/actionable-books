  ### Embracing 4.0


  > "If we want to upgrade our global economic operating system, we need to
  start by updating the thinking that underlies it; we need to update the
  essence of economic logic and thought."- Leading from the Emerging Future,
  page 11


  At the core of this book is the Matrix of Economic Evolution—a way of thinking
  about how society and economy have evolved and must continue to evolve. The
  authors cite four stages of evolution—each of which is a response to a
  particular challenge at a particular time. The first three are familiar to
  us—and they are responses to challenges we have faced in the past. The fourth
  stage is posited as both possible and necessary for addressing the challenges
  we now face—and challenge our thinking about economic and societal truths.


  **Stage 1.0** evolved in repose to the need for stability. Economies were
  state-driven, hierarchical and coercive. Stage 1.0 is rooted in a
  “traditional” awareness.


  **Stage 2.0** evolved in response to the challenge of growth. It saw the
  emergence of free market economies based on competition, and economic reward.
  This is what the authors identify as “ego-system” awareness. It is still very
  much alive today.


  **Stage 3.0** is a response to some of the negative dimensions of
  2.0—especially around how Stage 2.0 treats people and the environment. 3.0 is
  evident in labor rights and social security, for example. Civil society, NGOs,
  and government regulation of free markets are 3.0 phenomena. At the core of a
  3.0 economies are shared values.


  **Stage 4.0** which is the “emerging future” of the title, is a response to
  the global disruption that none of the prior stages can address. Climate
  change, resource scarcity, demographic shifts and the gap between rich and
  poor are all examples of the disruptions that require a new kind of thinking,
  acting and operating.


  Individuals, groups and organization need to work across boundaries to
  co-create new ways of operating based on an awareness of the whole, and the
  responsibility that we have to that whole. This shift is the move from what
  the authors call “ego-system” to “eco-system.” At the core of the shift is a
  shift from “me” thinking—focused on the wellbeing of the self to “we”
  thinking—the wellbeing of the whole.

  ### Listen Like You’ve Never Listened Before


  > "The success of an intervention depends on the interior condition of the
  intervener."- Leading from the Emerging Future, page 18


  The most powerful and most actionable dimension of Scharmer and Kaufer’s work
  is the emphasis on the possibility created when an individual or small group
  shift their way of being. The best single way to do that is to develop the
  capacity to listen deeply. The listening model presented that proposes four
  levels of listening (that line up nicely with Stages 1.0 to 4.0 and are used
  throughout the U process) can be a reference point as we think about how we
  listen.


  Level 1 listening is “downloading”—it’s the listening in which we hear what we
  expect to hear, without the possibility of really learning something new from
  the conversation. We project old judgments. Level 2 listening is factual—we
  look at the world around us and our primary tool is our rational minds. In
  level 2 we bring an open mind. Then, moving in to Level 3, we open our hearts.
  We adopt another person’s perspective, we begin to see things differently. We
  empathize. Level 4, however is when we bring an open will—we listen at the
  deepest levels to see what might emerge—we step beyond our preconceived
  notions. Developing the capacity to listen at the third and then the fourth
  level is one thing we can do to be better prepared to hear and observe the
  complexity we’re surrounded with.

  ### Letting Go, Letting Come


  > "The inner shift, from fighting the old to sensing and presencing an
  emerging future possibility, is at the core of all deep leadership work today.
  It’s a shift that requires us to expand our thinking from the head to the
  heart."- Leading from the Emerging Future, page 1


  Theory U is, in its essence, a visioning process that begins with seeing
  clearly and with “new eyes,” sensing what is happening in the larger system,
  and determining what can be let go. The U is the shape drawn to depict the
  process, with the left side of the U being about observation, the bottom about
  reflection and emergence and the right side of the U about prototyping and
  action—connected to a deep sense of purpose.


  While this sounds very big (and it is!) it is, you can begin to think about
  what it would take to shift from knowing to not knowing, from controlling to
  letting emerge—to using our hearts and minds, not only minds. It is this shift
  that will allow us to go through the “U” and can lead us to the 4.0 economy
  and society that the authors view as essential to our very survival.

  This is a big book in its scope. If you agree that we face challenges that are
  enormous and are looking for a new and inspiring lens from which to view those
  challenges, this is a book that I urge you to read. Theory U and the Matrix of
  Economic Evolution are big ideas. You can also explore Otto Scharmer’s
  [website](http://www.ottoscharmer.com/) which is rich with resources, tools,
  articles and even a link to a free MOOC through MIT.

> "The blind spot in the twentieth-century toolkit of economics and management can be summarized in a single word: consciousness." _\- Leading from the Emerging Future, page 67_

This is a book that tackles the profound disruptions that we are facing in the early part of the 21st century as a result of the collusion of forces that are calling our very survival on the planet into question. Otto Scharmer and Katrin Kaufer suggest that the ways we think about economy, finance, labor and organizations need to shift at the core.

This is not an easy book—though it is readable. The size and scope of the ideas can leave you feeling a bit overwhelmed at times. However, Scharmer and Kaufer’s work is enormously important. And, because it begins with the personal, it is also practical. The shifts that will drive the kinds of changes the world needs begin with shifts that we make in ourselves.

_Leading from the Emerging Future_ is grounded in a theory that Scharmer and his colleagues articulated some years ago—Theory U. In this book the authors tell stories that show Theory U in action and demonstrate how Scharmer’s ideas are already being applied to create a more hopeful future in collectives, companies, NGOs and even governments.
