  ### Becoming Your Ideal Self


  > "…scholars in organizational behaviour argue that imagining your ‘ideal
  self’ – as opposed to the ‘ought-to-be self,’ the one you think others want
  you to be – can be a powerful guiding force for change in behaviour,
  perceptions and attitude."- Leading the Life You Want, page 160


  By putting yourself, both personally and professionally, under a microscope,
  it should quickly become clear the components of your life that are enriching
  and adding value and quality to your days. It also becomes clear those things
  that are taking away from your experience or that take time away from the
  enriching components. This personal reflection is important and part of
  recognizing and working towards your ideal self.


  Friedman asks readers to identify the roles that make up who they are; this
  can be in your personal life or at work. Next reflect upon “the type of person
  you wish to become in each role.” This categorization of the parts that make
  up the whole of who you are and then the focus on where you want to go in
  these roles is an affirming activity. It allows you to assess what is most
  important to you now and where you want to take those roles. By
  conceptualizing this ideal self it helps to keep you focused as you work
  towards your future goals. Maybe you want to be a more attentive partner or
  maybe you want to speak up more in meetings. By acknowledging the roles that
  are the most important to your development and by visualizing the direction
  you want them to head in helps to keep you focused and get you closer to your
  ideal self.


  What resonated most with me is the value in periodically assessing your roles
  in life. Where are you in these roles? Are you where you want to be? If not,
  what can you be doing to get there? Sometimes we all need to step back and
  reflect on our direction so that we can end up where we want to be.

  ### Hold Yourself Accountable


  > "To be accountable means having the strength to act according to the values
  you hold dear."- Leading the Life You Want, page 171


  An exercise that Friedman recommends for helping to hold yourself accountable
  is to use the buddy system. You are much more likely to follow through with
  something if you have made it public knowledge. You are also more likely to
  follow through with something if someone else is doing it with you. Make your
  goals known. Ask for help from your network to hold you accountable for the
  goals you want to meet. A great example from the book is if you want to run a
  5k, why not train with someone else who is motivated to meet this goal? With
  both of you focused on achieving results you will both work to keep the other
  person focused and on task.

  ### Find the Larger Meaning


  > "Spend a few moments thinking expansively about how a task you already do,
  or a responsibility you now have, contributes to the wellbeing of others,
  either directly or indirectly."- Leading the Life You Want, page 165


  Take time out of your day to refocus and write down ideas of how tasks you are
  doing at work or at home are contributing to the wellbeing of others. This
  exercise falls under Friedman’s category of Aligning Actions with Values. When
  I read this it reminded me of words of wisdom I recently received from a
  mentor of mine at work. Her motto is flawless execution and when she told me
  about this she said it applies to everyone at all levels of an organization.
  People are always striving for lofty goals and ambitions and those are
  important to have to keep you motivated but you first need to master the
  basics. I am a recent grad and I am just starting out my career with a great
  organization in an entry-level position. For me this was an important exercise
  to reflect upon because it allows you to find meaning in the ways that your
  daily tasks can help support a colleague or your organization as a whole. By
  seeing the meaning in our daily tasks and how they effect others we can see
  the difference our work makes and feel purpose.
f_conclusion: >-
  I am a sucker for an inspirational story. The six case studies in this book
  and their amazing rise to reach their positions in life leaves you in awe. We
  all have amazing stories and sometimes you just have to step back and
  appreciate how different everyone’s journey is from one another.

  "We must have our heads in the clouds and our feet on the ground, dealing with
  the reality while dreaming of a better future. We must be optimists and
  realists. And we must never quit trying to live the life we want."

> "We must have our heads in the clouds and our feet on the ground, dealing with the reality while dreaming of a better future. We must be optimists and realists. And we must never quit trying to live the life we want." _\- Leading the Life You Want, page 208_

Everyone needs a reminder from time to time to refocus and assess what is going on in their life. By taking inventory of successes, failures and the people and things that are important to us we are able to correct our course or affirm that we are still on the right path. This self-reflection allows us to know whether we are living a rich and full life, both personally and professionally, and it allows us to find areas that are lacking and require our attention. In _Leading The Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life,_ Stewart D. Friedman inspires with case studies of six great leaders, detailing their accomplishments and what they have discovered along each of their respective journeys. The book then goes on to give the reader the necessary skills for integrating work and life with a central focus of being real, being whole and being innovative.

I am left inspired and focused on constantly reflecting on the balance in my life. It is and will always be a work in process, a constant reframing of where I am and where am I going. Important to also keep at the front of your mind are questions like who I am, who I want to be and how am I impacting the lives that I encounter on a daily basis? There is no perfect formula for finding balance between work and personal life but many are able to do so. What are your techniques for finding balance?
