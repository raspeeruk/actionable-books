  ### Write a Noble Sales Purpose (NSP) Statement


  > "You don’t have to be perfect. You don’t even have to be charismatic. You
  simply have to give people a cause worth caring about."- Leading with Noble
  Purpose, page 33


  How would you answer this question from a stranger: _Can you tell me about
  when you made difference to someone at work?_


  The answer will vary for different people but consider these two
  possibilities:


  _I work for the most amazing company. I make people around the world feel like
  they’re part of something amazing. Last week we located the owner of a lost
  dog and returned him to the ecstatic owner, it was the most amazing
  experience, that is what we do, make our customers delighted._ Or: _I’m an
  accountant, we do people’s taxes;_ or, _I’m in sales, working with medical
  supplies. It’s a bit of a drag._


  Which companies would you want to work for? When did you last speak of your
  company in a passionate way, and do your colleagues have the same enthusiasm?


  To elicit passion and enthusiasm from employees and customers, leaders must
  make a choice between a money story and a meaning story. The meaning story
  means changing the narrative around the business—this is your Noble Purpose,
  or, as Simon Sinek describes, your
  “[why](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/start-with-why/)”—which
  is the starting point to generating a band of true believers. This purpose
  within the organization flows through to innovation, systems and process
  improvement, and ultimately, to financial success. Noble leadership starts
  with you as the leader: you have to be clear about your own beliefs and
  mindset and be passionate about your story.


  Your noble sales purpose (NSP) is a succinct statement that describes your
  purpose as a company.


  *   Noble- It’s in the service of others,

  *   Sales- It’s based on what you sell, and

  *   Purpose- It’s your end game.


  Developing your NSP statement requires a rigorous conversation with your team,
  and your customers, starting with three discovery questions:


  *   How do we make a difference to our customers?

  *   How do we it differently than our competition?

  *   On your best day, what do you love about your job?


  Make this a conceptual brainstorming session and go beyond simple things:
  think about how you can help your customers sleep better at night. What makes
  you stand out from your competition? Do your employees care more about their
  mission and customers? What do you do to generate emotional value for your
  staff and customers? You need robust discussions around these key questions:
  use personal stories and examples, and reflect on the value you provide to
  your customers. Finally, begin your NSP statement with the word “we,” to
  embrace a communal sense of purpose.


  Here are two excellent examples of NSP statements:


  *   Flight Centre: We care about delivering amazing travel experiences.

  *   PharMEDium: We advance patient safety and provide peace of mind.

  ### Yes, AND


  > "A Leader who embraces Yes AND creates the condition for excellence."-
  Leading with Noble Purpose, page 133


  Negativity is endemic and unfortunately built into our primitive brains. The
  amygdala is always on the defensive, looking out for danger even if that
  danger is only to your ego. A threat is taken as a threat and adopting a
  defensive position is all too common in personal and business relationships.


  Consider the following scenario: a leader is discussing the move to a noble
  purpose and some responses include: “_Yes, purpose is great, but we still have
  to make money_,” or, “_Yes, customers are critical, but so are our
  shareholders._”


  These are referred to as “Yes, But” statements and the author suggests
  reframing these statements into Yes, AND statements. Clients of the author
  instituted the yes, AND rule within their meeting structures, to generate more
  positive statements such as; “_Yes, purpose is great AND we will be more
  attractive to other potential clients._” This simple exercise shifted the
  groups thinking into a more positive vein and moved away from the dreaded
  destructive negative reactions.

  ### Stay On Track During Stressful Situations


  > "When you stay true to yourself and your purpose, you stay pointed in the
  right direction."- Leading with Noble Purpose, page 184


  Behavior under stressful times is often reactive and left to chance alone,
  often with disastrous results. Imagine an employee makes a critical error and
  you react badly, chastising the employee in front of their peers. This
  potentially has long term repercussions and will affect that employee’s future
  performance, as well as establish a reputation among the rest of your team
  about your behavior under duress.


  What if there was a means of predicting future behavioral patterns?


  McLeod illustrates a technique founded by her client Kurtis Kammerer, termed
  the “pre-decision model,” and based around future decision making. Here is an
  example: imagine you ask your teenage son, _how would you describe yourself?_
  He responds by describing himself as an honest person, with strength of
  character, and good values. Next, direct the conversation to likely scenarios
  for a teenage boy to encounter: offers of drugs and sex, or observing poor
  behavior by his peers. How will he react based on the values he described?
  Walk through scenarios and write down your son’s decisions, so that he will
  know how to behave when confronted with those situations.


  Kammerer developed a similar agenda for his trainees. There will be times when
  you don’t like your job, you will be mad at your boss, etc. How are going to
  react? Write down the responses. This model gives you and your team a means of
  predicting behavior before the reactive behavior occurs, since you have
  already decided how you are going to behave.

Workplace engagement is shrinking and has reached epidemic proportions. Gallop’s statistics show that 51% of people are not actively engaged in their work and a further 17% are actively disengaged. In her second book, Lisa Earle McLeod gives a blueprint for leaders to stop leading with a superficial, money-based bias and instead adopt more compelling strategies to instill a “Noble” sense of purpose in their business. The author not only uses reasoning and statistical evidence to support her findings but, more importantly, provides a step-by-step guide to implement a Noble engagement within your business DNA that will resonate with your employees and reignite your profits. This is achieved by focusing on how your work impacts and delights your clients rather than focusing on financial goals. FInancial goals are important to be sure, but focusing on your organization’s noble purpose will inspire employee and customer engagement, which will inevitably result in better financial performance.

_Leading with Noble Purpose_ offers a revolutionary business growth strategy and a plea for business leaders to adapt a different paradigm—to bring meaning and purpose back into the workplace.
