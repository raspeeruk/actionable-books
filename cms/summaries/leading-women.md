  ### Recognize negative messages


  > "So many myths exist regarding female capabilities. Your awareness of these
  negative messages is a giant first step. Help \[others\] be aware also."-
  Leading Women, page 148


  A popular [Super Bowl ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3GpXgFwWmk) asked
  people of various ages and genders to both demonstrate and tell us what it
  means to do something “like a girl.” The ad asks when “like a girl” became an
  insult?


  The section written by Janet Rose Wojtalik entitled “Seven Keys to Unlocking
  Female Leadership” gives the reader different ways to have conversations about
  female leadership and empowerment; one of those is awareness of the negative
  messages about women. Things like doing something “like a girl” or being good
  at something “for a girl”. The section is geared toward talking to daughters,
  but I think it’s also important to have these conversations with our adult
  female peers and our male counterparts. If men never realize the subtleties of
  what amounts to female alienation, women will continue to lose the battle of
  equality. It’s important to look for teachable moments with young girls, each
  other, and with the men around us.


  I remember the day that I became aware that a glass ceiling does exist. I was
  a brand new sales rep at a medium sized company, attending my very first area
  meeting. When management was introduced, there was only one female out of
  about fifteen managers. I immediately wondered if I were witnessing female
  discrimination for the first time in my young career. As I grew in the company
  (and became a manager myself) I learned that they didn’t purposely
  discriminate against women. In fact, they wanted women in leadership. But like
  so many other companies, the subtleties of the unintentional “boys club”
  actually serve to unwittingly turn women away; ask any seasoned businesswoman.
  She’ll tell you that she’s seen it: locker room talk around the conference
  table, endless sports references, jokes that warrant apologies after the punch
  line. Until both men and women have an awareness, it will be more than
  revenues that suffer.

  ### Choice


  > "If a woman does not know she has a choice, she literally has no choice!"-
  Leading Women, page 79


  Growing up I was taught to be independent, to speak up for myself, and that I
  had options in life. This lesson was taught to me by women who hadn’t always
  had a lot of options. When I read the section by M. Bridget Cook-Burch, it was
  very eye opening to me. I know that I’m more confident and headstrong than
  many women. I always knew that some women made what might be considered
  high-risk choices or bad choices that I wouldn’t have made. But it never
  occurred to me that they made those decisions because they didn’t know they
  had a _choice_.


  This section was almost painful to read. Painful because some women don’t know
  they can take control, that they can indeed write their own stories. And
  painful because I recognize that there have been moments in my life and career
  where I didn’t feel like I had a choice. I’ve been in conversations with
  superiors where I was asked a question, presented with two “options” but felt
  that there was really only one “right” answer. From an actionable standpoint,
  it’s important that all leaders empower people to realize they will _always_
  have options. I’ll look for ways to empower women (and people) that I work
  with to see their choices and even create new options for themselves.

  ### Define your terms of power


  > "We want \[power\] but do not know how to get it and are afraid to admit we
  seek it. When we have it, we hide it. We are often afraid to use it because
  our society punishes powerful women in subtle and not-so-subtle ways."-
  Leading Women, page 11


  In the very first section of the book, Gloria Fendt gives what might be the
  most actionable advice for me. She gives simple steps to help define your own
  terms of power in interactions with others. I know that I have successfully
  used several in some interactions, but I can also recall many meetings where I
  failed to use them at all. They are:


  *   Be intentional

  *   Say the first word

  *   Say the last word


  When I have successfully used these tips, I have been confident and haven’t
  felt that there would be a struggle for power. Rather, there would be a frank
  conversation where everyone wins. When I’ve failed to use them, it’s because I
  went into the meeting or conversation lacking confidence; I felt like the
  underdog. At the time I didn’t see these conversations as struggles for power,
  but underlying they certainly were.


  The most actionable item for me in all my future interactions is to make sure
  that I am intentional, which will increase my confidence. The role I’m in with
  my company is brand new. It comes with new challenges for me and for the
  company, as well as a lot of tasks and responsibilities that fill my plate to
  the edges. If I’m going to reach most of my desired outcomes, I need to follow
  Fendt’s advice about being intentional about my actions and my interactions.
  She says “we must think proactively and intentionally about what we want to
  have happen, and then frame the conversation so that it will happen”. This
  goes for conversations with those above me, those I manage, but just as
  importantly, the conversations I have with myself.
f_conclusion: >-
  I tend to struggle with books that are specifically for women about
  leadership. I don’t agree with many of the so-called differences between men
  and women. I identify with what are typically both male and female
  characteristics and I find myself often furiously scribbling in the margins
  things like “all people” and “disagree”. While this book was mostly about
  women leading women, it does throw in a few places where men should be
  involved as well. Whatever your gender, I hope you pick it up. I’d love to
  hear what resonated with you in the comments below.

> "At the core of my passion is this nagging reality that the glass ceiling, although cracking, still exists." _\- Leading Women, page 141_

As a woman who has worked in the sales industry for more than 10 years, I’m no stranger to the need for female leadership and empowerment in business. I picked up Nancy D. O’Reilly’s _Leading Women: 20 Influential Women Share Their Secrets to Leadership, Business, and Life_ excited for the opportunity to see how 20 different women can help me, and help me help other women.

The book is organized in three sections: Mastering Your External Environment, Mastering Your Internal Environment, and Connecting to Support Each Other. Each section gives us tools that we can use in the business world, but we can also use the lessons in the lives we lead everyday as mothers, daughters, and friends. Gentlemen, please read on for how you can gain insights from the book as well.
