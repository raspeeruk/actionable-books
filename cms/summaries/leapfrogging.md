  ### Lose Control


  > "A journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you
  control it."- John Steinbeck, quoted in Leapfrogging, page 51


  After researching and gathering data on all kinds of business breakthroughs,
  including looking back over his 20 years of experience in the corporate and
  startup world, Kaplan realized that time and time again, unexpected events and
  big surprises played essential roles in how ideas surfaced and became a
  reality. He recounts detailed examples of how businesses ‘leapfrogged’ their
  mindset by either driving a surprise, or learning from surprises that happened
  to them.


  It’s difficult to just go out and challenge fundamental assumptions (a
  necessity for breakthroughs). Most business leaders resist doing that. In
  fact, it’s what they’re trained to do: manage uncertainty, increase
  predictability and maximize control. Their mission is to achieve business
  success by analyzing opportunities and executing flawless plans to achieve
  well-defined goals, essentially, to take uncertainty and surprise out of the
  equation.


  The problem is that this kind of mindset demonizes the natural aspects of life
  and the essential elements that are inherent in the process of achieving
  breakthrough success. “We must embrace counterintuitive ideas that go against
  the grain of management and leadership as we know it if we are going to
  succeed in today’s whirlwind world.”


  “Surprises are guideposts,” Kaplan says. **“Using surprises as strategic tools
  involves paying close attention to the things that happen around us and
  directly to us.”** He explains that the goal is to use unexpected events or
  surprising experiences, and our reactions to them, to reevaluate our
  strategies, plans, and most importantly, our assumptions about what’s
  possible.

  ### Persist


  > "Real failure results only when we do one thing: give up."- Leapfrogging,
  page 135


  Leapfrogging is about using failure as a tool to find success. When we’re
  attempting to create something groundbreaking, we will experience failures
  along the way. There’s almost no way around it. The key is to be ready for it,
  willing to accept it, and able to respond to it in a productive way.


  Kaplan describes a key phase in the process or journey of creating a
  breakthrough as the ‘Failure Zone’. It occurs after the initial excitement of
  an idea, and even the tangible focus of seeing it take form, but when we get
  closer to it coming to fruition, fear and doubt begin to sink in and drag us
  into the ‘Zone’.


  **Fear is even more powerful than failure itself.** When we’re doing something
  difficult, we’re preconditioned to give up. Our gut instinct is to submit to
  the urge to fail. And Kaplan cites research that makes this case. The results
  demonstrate that fear stems from uncertainty about the future and a sense of
  not being fully in control. The fear of failure can actually be worse than the
  failure itself because it will stop us from taking action, or moving forward
  and learning from any setbacks we might experience.


  Understanding this power of fear and doubt gives me a new perspective that
  will move me to persist when I notice fear creeping into my consciousness.
  Kaplan provides strategies to reframe failure, or “negative surprises,” as
  stepping stones and push the whole idea of failure itself into the background.
  With this mindset, I am now able to battle through the ‘Failure Zone’.


  Surprises are a natural part of life, and will exist in business, no matter
  how detailed your plans are. The key is to realize that they are your most
  valuable components to achieving real business breakthroughs.


  What surprises have you seen in your business or life that have helped you
  break assumptions and enabled you to ‘leapfrog’ into a better future?

  ### Act


  > "By taking a series of small steps, we begin a cycle of learning that leads
  to bigger and greater things."- Leapfrogging, page 106


  We sometimes forget (or don’t even know) the stories of the current great
  successes that we are familiar with now. Apple didn’t start out with plans to
  change the music industry by creating iTunes, it was just a small step that
  seemed like the right thing to do at the time. Google didn’t set out to
  transform the internet, they just wanted to find a way to make better library
  searches. They didn’t even have a way to make money until they created
  Adwords.


  Kaplan uses these examples and others to show that usually the best course of
  action is just that: **action.** When you move in a direction, whichever
  direction that is, you’ll learn a lot faster whether it’ll work or not, or if
  a different action is necessary. Studies show that having an entrepreneurial
  mindset, or taking action in the midst of uncertainty, will help you learn
  faster because you realize that you don’t know everything, and the best way to
  get real data is from actual interactions with customers, or at least a
  relative experience of what you’re trying to make happen.


  **“Entrepreneurs don’t believe they can predict the future, so they don’t try.
  Rather, they try to create it for themselves, one step at a time.”**


  My plan is to take the smallest step possible to learn what I need to know, or
  to test my assumption about what I think might happen at a larger scale. This
  way, if I fail, I won’t experience a significant drawback because I didn’t
  invest much.

> "If there’s something that’s really a big surprise… that’s generally the real world speaking to you, saying there’s something you don’t yet understand." _\- Leapfrogging, page 6_

**Do you like surprises?**

Maybe if it’s your birthday, but in business, surprises are usually not desirable. It means that something is not going according to plan. And yet, it happens all the time. In fact, most significant business breakthroughs come from some kind of surprise.

In _Leapfrogging_, Soren Kaplan explains the critical necessity of surprises, and how to get more of the kind you want. He defines ‘leapfrogging’ as the process of overcoming limiting mindsets and barriers to create business breakthroughs. In essence, he wants us to learn how to ‘leapfrog our mindsets’ and overcome hidden assumptions. When that happens, it’s a good surprise.

The main messages of the book are that 1) Business breakthroughs deliver surprise, 2) Surprises are strategic tools that drive breakthroughs, and 3) Business breakthroughs transform people and organizations.

**Just reading this book changed my mindset and gave me a good surprise.**

Now I know how to foster business breakthroughs. It can be done with a little practice and a lot of effort.
