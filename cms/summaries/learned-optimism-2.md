  ### Identifying your Explanatory Style


  > "Explanatory style is the manner in which you habitually explain to yourself
  why events happen. It is the great modulator of learned helplessness."-
  Learned Optimism, page 15


  When faced with a calamity, Seligman explains that we process it in three
  ways. First by accessing the longevity of the setback (permanence), second the
  scope of its affects (pervasiveness) and third the level of personal
  responsibility you have for the circumstance (personalization). The
  culmination of this three-step process is your _explanatory style,_ which
  ultimately equates to your level of optimism or pessimism. A pessimist would
  see a setback as long term, effecting everything they do and as all their
  fault, whereas an optimist facing the same setback would see it as temporary,
  confined and caused by some external factor, thus not their fault. The
  optimists create distance between the situation and themselves, making it much
  easier to dust themselves off and trudge forward. Unfortunately, the
  pessimists are more apt to falter into _learned helplessness_, which Seligman
  defines as “the give up reaction.”


  Through various studies, Seligman demonstrates the extensive research that
  linked explanatory style to your aptitude for learned helplessness; the most
  persuasive was the shock experiment. His team subjected three groups of dogs
  to shocks. Group 1 was able to find the key to make the shocks stop, Group 2
  had no power to affect the shocks and Group 3 was a control group. The same
  groups were then placed in an easily escapable pen, and subjected to the same
  treatment, surprisingly enough Group 1 escaped, yet Group 2 made no effort to
  escape the shocks, evidence of learned helplessness. While this study,
  Seligman recognizes, would no longer pass ethical standards, it is easily
  applied to the human variety. A person’s explanatory style and tendency
  towards or against learned helplessness, if left unattended, has been proven
  to directly impact the way a person moves through their life, the progression
  of their personal and professional goals and ultimately the likelihood of
  depression.

  ### Learned Optimism


  > "I have found that pessimism is escapable… by learning a new set of
  cognitive skills."- Learned Optimism, page 5


  There is a time and a place to utilize the spectrum of outlook tendencies;
  however, those who find themselves consistently pessimistic likely also find
  themselves with a higher propensity for anxiety and depression. Seligman and
  his colleagues conducted a longitudinal study to determine whether depression
  is caused by pessimism or simply correlated. This study assessed a group of
  children for their outlook tendency and evaluated them over a four year
  period. They found that “children who started out as pessimists were the ones
  most likely, over the four years, to get depressed and stay depressed. Those
  children who started out as optimists stayed non-depressed or, if they did get
  depressed, they recovered rapidly.”


  “The good news is that the pessimists can learn the skills of optimism and
  permanently improve the quality of their lives”. By learning to adjust your
  patterns of processing, you are able to nip pessimism at the source and define
  a new optimistic tendency. Seligman demonstrates we can do this by
  incorporating the foundational theory of Cognitive Therapy and deploying
  _disputation_ and _distraction_ when and where necessary. Cognitive Therapy
  represents a permanent change to your explanatory style, incorporating five
  steps.


  1.  Learn to identify negative thought patterns when you are feeling your
  lowest.

  2.  Dispute those thoughts by suggesting evidence to the contrary.

  3.  Re-attribute new explanations.

  4.  Distract yourself by reverting to an alternative thought pattern, as
  simple as thinking of something else.

  5.  Develop habits around recognizing and questioning depression causing
  reactions and squashing them before they manifest. Seligman argues that
  disputation is more affective in the long run, “because successfully disputed
  beliefs are less likely to recur when the same situation presents itself
  again.”

  ### The Balancing Act


  > "When failure occurs, it is because either talent or desire is missing. But
  failure also can occur when talent and desire are present in abundance but
  optimism is missing."- Learned Optimism, page 13


  Perhaps the most valuable takeaway for the modern day professional is the
  application of this newfound understanding of explanatory style and outlook
  tendencies to one’s career path and role choice. Seligman has conducted
  various studies related to hiring practices, finding indicators for success
  based on the applicant’s optimistic scoring. This is most evident in sales
  based roles, a career that is riddled with setbacks, hard walls and consistent
  competition. Seligman found that “optimism was the key to sales success”.
  Testing for optimism at the time of hiring, he evaluated the group’s success
  throughout their first year on the job. Perhaps not surprising at all, those
  who scored higher were more successful in their first year, and those who
  scored lowest had vacated their position.


  Resiliency and perseverance defines an optimist; however, the reader also
  learns that optimists deploy a level of distorted reality, to inventively move
  past the obstacles and conjure up new alternatives. Optimists “have to dream
  things that don’t yet exist, to explore boundaries beyond the company’s
  present reach”. Seligman is quick to point out that those who don’t come by
  optimism naturally also have value in the workplace by applying mild or
  “professional” pessimism. “The company also needs its pessimists, the people
  who have an accurate knowledge of present realities… their role is caution,
  their banner is the yellow flag.”


  While Seligman makes a strong case for optimism, there is no denying that a
  balance of tendencies applied in various spheres in life would provide the
  most holistic outcome. “Like the successful company, we each have in us an
  executive who balances the counsels of daring against the counsels of doom.”
f_conclusion: >-
  This hopeful and actionable reproach to pessimism in _Learned Optimism_ is
  inspiring. With the growing epidemic of depression and anxiety and the
  propensity for negativity in our daily influences, it is imperative that we
  harvest the skills and manifest the habits to deploy optimism in our every day
  lives. Our personal sphere demands resiliency as we tackle life’s milestones
  and relationship hurdles and our professional sphere demands perseverance and
  commitment to finding a way to success. By recognizing the application of each
  explanatory style and committing to awareness and self-improvement, Seligman
  has given us the tools to live a happier, more productive life.

> "Our thoughts are not merely reactions to events; they change what ensues." _\- Learned Optimism, page 7_

As we know, life inflicts the same setbacks and tragedies on us all, but how we as individuals weather these storms is wholly unique and independent from our peers. In fact, it is likely that our tendency towards a positive or negative reproach is innate, that we are born with either an optimistic or negative outlook. This innate tendency, if left unattended, can affect the way we perform and interact in all spheres of life, both professionally and personally. In _Learned Optimism_, author Martin E. P. Seligman compiled countless studies and comparative research summaries to present a compelling and hopeful case for the opportunity to counteract your innate tendencies, through learned and deliberate practices to form selective approaches to life’s rollercoaster of events.

While this piece is quite involved and wide reaching, readers will learn the foundation of both optimistic and pessimistic outlooks and how to identify their own explanatory style, the theory behind learned optimism and the need for selective and situational application. Seligman presents readers with various opportunities to assess their natural tendency through quizzes within the book, providing opportunity for real time application of the theories and suggestions presented.
