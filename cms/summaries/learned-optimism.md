  ### Optimism is a Learnable Skill


  > "What if optimism is a learned skill, one that can be permanently
  acquired?"- Learned Optimism, page 14


  Seligman’s team studied pessimism by inducing helplessness in dogs. These dogs
  learned that nothing they did turned off the mild shocks in their cages, so
  even when they could escape, they didn’t.


  About a third of the dogs, though, never succumbed. They couldn’t be forced to
  feel helpless. What if this immunity could be learned?


  When helpless dogs were pulled back and forth over a small divider, repeatedly
  shown they could escape the shocks, **100% unlearned the helplessness.**


  Unlearned it so well that they were inoculated against helplessness for life.


  Experiments with humans, using frustrating puzzles and noises, produced
  identical results. Helplessness could be learned, and it could be unlearned.
  **Once it was unlearned, the effects were permanent.**

  ### Disputing Negative Thinking by Analyzing Evidence, Alternatives,
  Implications, and Usefulness


  > "Learned optimism works not through an unjustifiable positivity about the
  world but through the power of 'non-negative' thinking."- Learned Optimism,
  page 221


  The Disputation process involves another acronym: EAIU, for Evidence,
  Alternatives, Implications, and Usefulness.


  *   What does the **Evidence** say? The most effective way to dispute a
  negative belief is to realize it is **factually inaccurate**. In the example
  above, if you have Evidence that, in fact, the boss values you and there are
  no plans to park you at the curb, it’s easier to change your belief.

  *   Is there an **Alternative** explanation? Most adversities have multiple
  contributing factors. Focusing on those which are **changeable, specific** to
  the current circumstances**, and non-personal** leads to optimistic beliefs.

  *   What are the true **Implications** of the adversity? In a process called
  **decatastrophizing**, when we consider that the most likely negative
  consequence is relatively minor compared to the “end of the world” scenario we
  first conjured up, our beliefs lead to more optimistic consequences.

  *   Finally, what if it turns out our belief is, in fact, true? Does that
  automatically make it **Useful**? Maybe blowing your diet (adversity) makes
  you think you’re a glutton (belief). Even if that were true, is it helpful?
  It’s more helpful to **focus on what we can change** (“I need help with my
  eating habits.”)


  Should you decide the belief is true, and there’s nothing you can do about it
  right now, **distraction techniques can keep you from ruminating on the
  adversity,** which is a prime cause of pessimism and depression.


  Seligman’s research began in earnest about the time I was 15 years old. If I’d
  known that someone somewhere was researching how we could choose to be
  optimists, I would have rejoiced. Also, I would have found them and forced the
  answer from them and changed my life.

  ### Changing Our Belief About Adversity Changes its Consequence


  > "We have found over the years that positive statements you make to yourself
  have little if any effect. What is crucial is what you think when you fail,
  using the power of 'non-negative thinking.'"- Learned Optimism, page 15


  Knowing a positive perspective in the face of adversity was based on beliefs,
  Seligman’s team created a process to learn optimism by exploring different
  beliefs using a system Seligman calls ABCDE.


  When you suffer some **Adversity**, if you analyze what you **Believe** about
  it you’ll see the **Consequences** as a logical result.


  **What if you change your Belief?**


  For instance, the boss asks you to rewrite the conclusion of your report
  (Adversity.)


  If your Belief is “The boss is looking for an excuse to fire me” the
  Consequences will be bad feelings and poor performance.


  If you changed your Belief to “This report must be extremely important
  upstairs” the Consequences could be determination and an excellent job.


  That’s ABC: Adversity, Belief, Consequences.


  D is **Disputation**: reasoning ourselves into accepting another Belief. I’ll
  cover this in more detail in insight #2.


  E is **Energization**: what we’re motivated to do because we’ve Disputed a
  pessimistic Belief.


  For the next two weeks, every time something goes wrong, write down the ABCs:


  *   What was the **Adversity**?

  *   What did you **Believe** about it?

  *   What were the **Consequences** (feelings and actions)?


  Once you’ve recognize those ABCs, it’s time to inject some Disputation into
  the process.

  During the past 10 years I’ve read dozens of books based on Seligman’s work
  and its practical application. I’ve taken a long slow road from severe
  pessimism and depression to a life of great optimism.

Al Capp’s satirical comic strip Li’l Abner introduced an iconic character, Joe Btfsplk. Joe walked around with a dark cloud over his head — literally. He brought misfortune everywhere he went. In one sequence, he escaped his cloud, but took it back, accepting that was just who he was: the little guy with the dark cloud over his head.

It’s common to believe that some of us are born with a sunny outlook and others are doomed to life under a dark cloud.

_It’s not true._

**Optimism can be learned** and pessimism overcome.

A pioneer in the field of positive psychology, Martin E. P. Seligman has spent decades studying negative and positive thinking, developing **practical methods** to transform the former into the latter.

Whether we are pessimistic or optimistic depends on whether we see adversities as

*   permanent
*   pervasive
*   personal

or

*   temporary
*   specific to these circumstances
*   not our fault

Optimism, it turns out, is **a skill each of us can learn.**

### Disputing Negative Thinking by Analyzing Evidence, Alternatives, Implications, and Usefulness

The Disputation process involves another acronym: EAIU, for Evidence, Alternatives, Implications, and Usefulness.

*   What does the **Evidence** say? The most effective way to dispute a negative belief is to realize it is **factually inaccurate**. In the example above, if you have Evidence that, in fact, the boss values you and there are no plans to park you at the curb, it’s easier to change your belief.

During the past 10 years I’ve read dozens of books based on Seligman’s work and its practical application. I’ve taken a long slow road from severe pessimism and depression to a life of great optimism.

_Learned Optimism_ is a shortcut. Using the ABCDE and EAIU tools, in a short time (I short-circuited a powerfully negative thinking pattern out of my life in less than a week) **you can learn optimism.**

What do you think? Is a negative perspective simply a **natural consequence** of a difficult situation, or **can we learn to be optimistic despite our circumstances?**
