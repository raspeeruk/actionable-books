  ### The Keys to Less Doing


  > "Keep in mind that when I say ‘optimize,’ I’m talking about getting the
  maximum benefit for the least amount of time."- Less Doing, More Living, page
  104


  At the core of the Doing Less approach are three keys: **Optimize**,
  **automate** and **outsource**.


  By **optimizing** you’re breaking down your projects, tasks, or commitments to
  the bare minimum. You’re simplifying it in such as way that it eliminates
  everything that’s not completely necessary. By breaking down the tasks to
  those bare essentials, you’re able to tackle them in bite-size chunks and,
  possibly, even delegate or outsource them later on.


  **Automating** is about creating systems or processes so that you don’t need
  to waste valuable time and energy on replicating results that you’ve done
  countless times already. You’re able to set it and forget it.


  Whatever is left can get **outsourced** to generalists or specialists. You can
  spend more time on those things you’re passionate about and love to do (and
  you feel a bit like a rock star doing it). The key here, though, is to make
  sure you’ve done the first two before outsourcing anything.


  This whole framework is designed to free up your time and your mind so that
  you can do the things that you really want to be doing and not just the things
  you feel like you have to do.


  Doing less allows you to spend time and energy on the more important things
  such as idea generation or creative projects. Part of the Doing Less system
  has to do with taking care of your brain and treating it as a precious
  resource. By doing this, you build the foundation you need to be doing your
  best work.

  ### Get organized: Set limits


  > "To streamline your life and help yourself get organized, always set
  reasonable limits for the things you do."- Less Doing, More Living, page 88


  We often think of setting limits as something that is negative. Meisel helps
  you see setting limits as something that can be both.


  The idea is to focus on setting both minimum and maximum limits on the things
  you do daily. For example, setting minimum limits on how much you exercise in
  a week (a minimum of three days) or setting a maximum when it comes to how
  much time you’ll spend watching YouTube videos of cats doing…anything.


  The key here is to set and stick to your upper limits and lower limits as each
  have a place and can be useful in their own right. You need to set and abide
  by a reasonable limit for yourself in any task you complete.


  Limits can be set on anything and everything: email, time spent on Facebook,
  your workweek or how much money you spend each week eating out.


  It’s important to note that everything can and should have a limit – even time
  spent relaxing.


  Limits can refer to times or amounts, whatever makes the most sense.

  ### Eliminate Your To-Do List


  > "The problem with the way most people use to-do lists is that they become a
  dumping ground for things that can’t actually be done."- Less Doing, More
  Living, page 30


  I’ll wait a second for you to get over the shock of the above statement. Good?
  Ok.


  Meisel gets real here. Most of us have become so attached to our to-do lists
  because they make us feel like we’re accomplishing things. For many of us, our
  to-do lists are the first measure of our success. If we can knock off
  everything on our to-do list in a day, we’ve been successful, right?


  Not necessarily.


  The problem with most to-do lists, Meisel says, is that when you look at your
  long list of things you have to do, including the things you actually can’t,
  it creates cognitive dissonance. Meaning we put everything on our to do list,
  even if we know we’re not going to be able to get it done. This makes us feel
  pretty unable and tends to hold us back.


  The key to addressing this is timing.


  Every task we set out to do has a time associated to it: when to start it,
  when to check on it, and when it needs to be finished. If you can create the
  habit of actually bringing those tasks into your focus when it’s appropriate
  to deal with them (and actually deal with them), you’ll never need to worry
  about it again.


  Meisel suggest asking yourself the following questions as you attempt to
  attack your to-do list: **_“When is the right day and time for me to do
  this?”_**


  After that, choose one of these four options:


  1.  Do it now

  2.  Defer it to the right time

  3.  Delegate it (to a virtual assistant, for example)

  4.  Email it or manually add it to a note taking app to view later
f_conclusion: >-
  If you’re stuck on steps to take based on what the book tells you, don’t
  worry, Meisel provides an ample amount of resources, sites, services and apps
  that you can access to start to really optimize your life. You don’t have to
  go to the extreme and do them all, you can choose one or two from the list and
  experiment to find out what works for you.
