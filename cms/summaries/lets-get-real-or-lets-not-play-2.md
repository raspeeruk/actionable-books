  ### Go for the Win-Win


  > "Helping clients succeed is not an attempt to be nice; it is not
  philanthropic or selfless. It is a powerful, if paradoxical, means of getting
  what we want."- Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play, page 12


  For those familiar with Stephen Covey’s landmark book, [_Seven Habits of
  Highly Effective
  People_](../summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/), the
  expression, “Go for the Win-Win” will sound familiar. (It’s one of the seven
  habits.) And for good reason. The authors of _Let’s Get Real or Let’s Not
  Play,_ Mahan Khalsa and Randy Illig are true students of Covey and have woven
  his timeless lessons into this book. (Covey even wrote the forward.)


  The subtitle of the book – _Transforming the Buyer/Seller Relationship –_ is
  more than a tagline, it’s the true objective of this book. And the good news
  is that, as the seller, the power is truly in your hands. As Khalsa and Illig
  state repeatedly, it really comes down to a matter of **intent**. What’s your
  true goal when you enter into the sales process? Is it to “make the sale”,
  like 99% of the other vendors out there? Or is it to genuinely help a client
  solve a problem.


  Zig Ziglar said years ago that, “You can get everything you want in life, if
  you help enough people get what they want.” And that’s what _Let’s Get Real or
  Let’s Not Play_ is about. It’s a book for people who want to escape the
  feeling of “selling”, and embrace the notion of helping the client solve their
  problems; the problems that matter to them, in a way that resonates with their
  larger objectives.


  Nice sentiment. But how do we **do** that?

  ### Move Off the Solution


  > "The short and sweet rule of qualifying the Opportunity is: No pain, no gain
  = no opportunity. In a business context, the word "problem" is a synonym for
  pain; the word "result" is a synonym for gain."- Let's Get Real or Let's Not
  Play, page 48


  It’s easy for us to get dazzled by our own bells and whistles. To want to talk
  about how great we are because of our unique new feature. Unfortunately, if
  the “new feature” doesn’t address the needs of the client, they really don’t
  care. And now you’ve just wasted their time. Particularly in the early days of
  the client relationship build, you want to spend as much time talking about
  the **_client_** as possible. And not about yourself. The goal here is to side
  step “features and benefits” until you have a clear sense of the client needs.
  Khalsa and Illig talk about this as **_Moving off the Solution_**. And here’s
  the formula:


  **Listen + Softening Statement + Move**


  If you’re in sales, or have been in the past, you’ve often faced the “Show me
  what you’ve got” statement in the first two minutes of a meeting. Resist the
  urge to do so. If your product is sophisticated (at all), you could likely
  spend hours talking about it and never cover everything. True, right? Use
  that. Integrate it into the formula above. It might look something like this:


  **PROSPECT:** “Okay, show me what you’ve got.”


  **YOU:** “Sure. I could talk for hours with great enthusiasm – and that may
  not be what you want. Do you mind if I ask…?”


  or…


  **YOU:** “I’d be glad to. In order to keep my comments relevant to your
  situation, could I ask…?”


  or…


  **YOU:** “We’ve helped many companies address business problems with (the
  requested solution) and each one had different priorities and objectives.
  Would it be okay if we started out talking a bit about…?”

  ### A Fourth Approach


  > "Of course, we consultants do not like to call it guessing - we call it
  diagnosis, assessment, analysis. Yet, if one didn't know any better, it would
  look a lot like guessing."- Let's Get Real or Let's Not Play, page 26


  As Khalsa and Illig explain, most of us in sales pursue one or more of the
  following traditional approaches when interacting with a client:


  1.  **We tell**. (About our product/service, our success stories, our bells
  and whistles)

  2.  **We accept.** (We propose a solution based on exactly what they told us
  without digging deeper)

  3.  **We guess.** (See quote above about guessing)


  But of course we do. What’s the alternative? It comes back to intent. If you
  had genuine intention of helping the client find the ideal solution to their
  unique problem, wouldn’t you want to know what the true issue was first?
  Wouldn’t you dig a little deeper, get to know the real hurdles, challenges and
  pain points? Wouldn’t you want to connect with the client’s hopes and
  aspirations? Of course you would.


  Khalsa and Illig suggest that a far more impactful way to engage the client is
  through **_mutual exploration_**. The entire first half of their book is
  dedicated to what mutual exploration means (in detail), but suffice it to say
  that it comes down to using your initial time with a client to talk about
  **_them_**. Not just about you and your offering. It starts with _Moving off
  the Solution_ (more on that in insight #2), then _Getting out_ _All the
  Issues_, _Prioritizing the Issues, Gathering evidence and impact_ and
  _Exploring context and constraints_.


  Where in there did you hear “show them how great our product is”? You didn’t.
  The reason being that the initial conversations with a client is not about
  selling. It’s about learning more about the client so that if/when you **do**
  present your solution, it’s presented in a way that addresses their unique
  needs. A big part of the exploration process is that you are coming to a
  **mutual** understanding of the problem. Once it’s been defined (and provided
  your solution **actually** addresses their needs) it’s a much easier sale;
  primarily because the client knows as well as you do exactly what they need.
  (Reminds me of that great quote – “people hate to be sold, but they love to
  buy.”)


  And what happens if it turns out they don’t actually need your solution? You
  exit gracefully. Because if you truly can’t help them, (here’s the kicker)
  they weren’t going to buy from you anyway. Better to know up front and avoid a
  lot of extra time (theirs and yours).
f_conclusion: >-
  And what do you fill the blank with? Well, that’s entirely up to you. Just
  make it about the client, make it relevant and remember your intention – To
  help the customer find the right solution to their problem.

It’s been a while since I’ve read a sales book. In reflecting on that, I found this quote from _Let’s Get Real or Let’s Not Play_ to be incredibly apt: _“Many business development methodologies tend to emphasize completeness and thoroughness over ease of adoption and application. They are very good but rarely used, and thus are not as helpful as they could be.”_

I’ve always prided myself on being an “authentic” salesperson; constantly putting the client’s needs first. Good intentions, no clear process. Having now devoured _Let’s Get Real or Let’s Not Play_ cover to cover, I’m delighted to share that I believe I’ve found my process. One that genuinely works from the position of helping the client get what they want; something I’ve always believed to be at the root of all successful transactions.

_Let’s Get Real or Let’s Not Play_ is my new sales bible. The approach of the authors is authentic, thorough and fresh. Their results are proven, as they’ve built their wildly successful sales training program [_ninetyfive-5_](http://www.nf5.com/) around it, and their concepts are being used globally. I found the book rich with structure, specific case studies and examples. But just as I started to become overwhelmed with the thoroughness of it , they’d remind me of the underlying theme – **intent** counts for more than structure. That’s a mantra I can get behind. The rest will come with practice.
