  ### Rebels with a Cause


  > "No matter how much societal pressure you deploy, there will be defectors."-
  Liars and Outliers, page 245


  The simplified gist of _Liars and Outliers_ is that within society, there are
  rules. Most people will follow those rules (cooperators) and some won’t
  (defectors). As a society, we’re better off when we follow the rules. As
  individuals, it’s often in our short-term self-interest to “defect”. Stealing
  your neighbor’s car, for example, is faster and easier than earning the money
  to buy your own. And yet we trust that – despite it actually being extremely
  easy to steal a car – our cars are relatively safe. Trust. That’s really the
  crux of any society, argues Schneier. We trust the people we know, and trust
  that those we don’t know will (for the most part) follow the systems we have
  in place. More on that later.


  Most interesting in Schneier’s text was the irrefutable proof that in **any
  society** (society defined as “any group of people with a loose common
  interest” page 10), you will encounter some level of defection; those who
  refuse to follow the rules set by society. It is statistically impossible to
  remove all defection from any group of individuals.


  The second most interesting point in the book (in my humble opinion) was the
  reminder that defection is not, by default, bad. It’s simply a break from the
  norm. Those who pushed for the abolishment of slavery were defectors. So was
  Nelson Mandella. Nazi soldiers were defectors from the global community, but
  cooperators to the society that was Nazi Germany. And this is where things
  start to get interesting. As Schneier beautifully illustrates towards the back
  of the book, it is near impossible to look at the reasons for someone’s
  cooperation or defection through a simple lens of “good” or “bad” because it
  all depends on the context of the “society” we’re defining. And, as we’ll
  explore in insight #2, we often belong to many, many “societies” at once…
  often with conflicting values or other motivations.


  But, before we get to that, let’s look at the four main societal pressures
  that exist in all circumstances…

  ### David beats Goliath


  > "In general, it takes more societal pressure to get someone to defect from a
  smaller group interest in favor of a larger group interest than it does to get
  someone to do the reverse."- Liars and Outliers, page 152


  So, here’s my favourite actionable idea from the book – being the “little guy”
  can actually be an advantage at getting people to support your idea or vision.


  We all belong to a number of “societies” at any given time. Our family, our
  company, the division within that company, our social circle, etc., etc. There
  is a very good chance that within these groups, there are at least a couple
  conflicting pressures.


  Example: Your company touts “Work/Life Balance” as an important part of their
  culture, and back it up with half-day Fridays in the summer. Your particular
  workgroup, however, is comprised of career driven individuals who pride
  themselves on being the last ones to leave the office. We call this a
  “Societal Dilemma”; cooperating with one society automatically means defecting
  from another. (Incidentally, Alex Lowy has a terrific book on “Dilemmas”
  called _No Problem_, which we summarized [here](../summaries/no-problem/)).


  **So what do you do?**


  Research has shown that we are far more likely to cooperate with the smaller
  society (in this case, your work group) than with the larger society. The
  stronger relationships we have with members of smaller societies enhance the
  impact of Reputational Pressure that we discussed in insight #1.


  **Let’s add another level.** Your friends are all going to the beach in the
  afternoon. Or your spouse has asked you to take the afternoon off to spend
  with him or her. **Now what do you do?**


  As we can see, our choices to cooperate or defect are influenced by factors
  far beyond a binary.

  ### Connect Four


  > "\[E\]ffective societal pressure usually involves all four categories,
  though not necessarily in equal measure. Considering all four will indicate
  how resources might be most effectively spent."- Liars and Outliers, page 240


  As Schneier defines, there are, at any given time, four sets of societal
  pressures influencing our decisions on whether to cooperate or defect with a
  given norm.


  **Moral Pressure**. This pressure comes from inside. It feels “bad” to steal,
  and “good” to return someone’s wallet.


  **Reputational Pressure**. This is all about how people perceive our actions.
  As the name suggests, we engage in certain behaviours because of the impact it
  can have on our reputation. We care what people think about us.


  **Institutional Pressure**. These are the rules or laws that are set out for
  us. Break those laws, and there are consequences. This is true whether the
  laws are set by the government, our employer or a religious group we belong
  to.


  **Security Systems**. The moat around a castle is a security system. So is the
  Alarm system sticker you have on your window (even though you don’t have the
  system itself). Security Systems are designed to induce cooperation, or deter
  defection.


  All four of these societal pressures influence our actions, to some degree or
  another. As Schneier suggest in the quote above, you really need to have all
  four in action to be effective in creating a certain behaviour in your
  “society”. As a business manager whose not necessarily getting the behaviour
  you want from your team, it’s worth running through the list and seeing where
  you might be falling short. Are you tapping into all four of the societal
  pressures?
f_conclusion: >-
  _Liars and Outliers_ is one of those books you need to devour in a few
  sittings, pen and paper in hand. You need to chew on it a bit, as the concepts
  are meaty and – for most of us – new territory. But the bottom line is that
  this stuff is important. As our world “grows smaller” through technology, but
  grows larger as our population count climbs, the societal pressures we face
  will continue to expand and shift. The security systems we build to encourage
  certain behaviours will become increasingly complex, while defectors will
  continue to create ways to circumvent the system. Some will defect for good.
  Others will defect for evil. The very judgement of which relies entirely on
  the society(s) to which **you** belong.

I’m not going to lie, I struggled with this book a little at the beginning. Not because it isn’t well written (it is). And not because the subject matter wasn’t relevant or fascinating (it was). I struggled because Bruce Schneier’s _Liars and Outliers_ was completely new territory for me. This is a book about societal pressures; about what makes us obey the law (or break it), stay monogamous (or cheat on our spouses) and lie on our taxes.

_Liars and Outliers_ really is a fascinating book, it’s just that there was – for me – a steep learning curve to the concepts. And so, in true Actionable fashion, I’m going to attempt to distill some of the fundamentals… in two pages or less. Here we go.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Rebels with a Cause

> "No matter how much societal pressure you deploy, there will be defectors."- Liars and Outliers, page 245

The simplified gist of _Liars and Outliers_ is that within society, there are rules. Most people will follow those rules (cooperators) and some won’t (defectors). As a society, we’re better off when we follow the rules. As individuals, it’s often in our short-term self-interest to “defect”. Stealing your neighbor’s car, for example, is faster and easier than earning the money to buy your own. And yet we trust that – despite it actually being extremely easy to steal a car – our cars are relatively safe. Trust. That’s really the crux of any society, argues Schneier. We trust the people we know, and trust that those we don’t know will (for the most part) follow the systems we have in place. More on that later.

Most interesting in Schneier’s text was the irrefutable proof that in **any society** (society defined as “any group of people with a loose common interest” page 10), you will encounter some level of defection; those who refuse to follow the rules set by society. It is statistically impossible to remove all defection from any group of individuals.

As Schneier beautifully illustrates towards the back of the book, it is near impossible to look at the reasons for someone’s cooperation or defection through a simple lens of “good” or “bad” because it all depends on the context of the “society” we’re defining. And, as we’ll explore in insight #2, we often belong to many, many “societies” at once… often with conflicting values or other motivations.

But, before we get to that, let’s look at the four main societal pressures that exist in all circumstances…

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Connect Four

> "\[E\]ffective societal pressure usually involves all four categories, though not necessarily in equal measure. Considering all four will indicate how resources might be most effectively spent."- Liars and Outliers, page 240

As Schneier defines, there are, at any given time, four sets of societal pressures influencing our decisions on whether to cooperate or defect with a given norm.

**Moral Pressure**. This pressure comes from inside. It feels “bad” to steal, and “good” to return someone’s wallet.

**Reputational Pressure**. This is all about how people perceive our actions. As the name suggests, we engage in certain behaviours because of the impact it can have on our reputation. We care what people think about us.

**Security Systems**. The moat around a castle is a security system. So is the Alarm system sticker you have on your window (even though you don’t have the system itself). Security Systems are designed to induce cooperation, or deter defection.

All four of these societal pressures influence our actions, to some degree or another. As Schneier suggest in the quote above, you really need to have all four in action to be effective in creating a certain behaviour in your “society”. As a business manager whose not necessarily getting the behaviour you want from your team, it’s worth running through the list and seeing where you might be falling short. Are you tapping into all four of the societal pressures?

Others will defect for evil. The very judgement of which relies entirely on the society(s) to which **you** belong.

If you’re looking for an education, pick up Schneier’s _Liars and Outliers_. It’s a fascinating read.
