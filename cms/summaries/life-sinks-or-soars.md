  ### The Gift of Choice


  > "This gift determines our finances, our relationships, our careers, our
  education, our personal growth, our spiritual growth, our physical health, our
  emotions, everything."- Life Sinks or Soars, page 34


  This may sound overly simplistic and obvious, and Kalley, through his
  character Hugh, acknowledges as much: We are _all_ given the gift of choice.
  The book’s tagline is quite poignant: “We are where we have chosen to be”.
  Everything we do in life is based upon choice, and we are forced to make
  countless choices as we go about our daily lives. When we give in and order
  that delicious looking chocolate cheesecake for dessert at lunch, it impacts
  our diet and, consequently, how much harder we’ll have to push ourselves that
  evening at the gym. Where Earl finds himself on his journey is a direct result
  of a million different choices he has made. Knowing how to make the correct
  choices—and why we should make them—is the purpose of this book. As Hugh says,
  “The slightest difference in the choices we make will profoundly influence the
  largest differences in the end results.”

  ### Why?


  > "…if you can’t clearly articulate your reasons why you want this prize or
  these prizes \[as a result of achieving your goal\], you will not stay the
  course."- Life Sinks or Soars, page 52


  It is important to have goals. We all know this. But why set a goal? What’s
  the purpose? In other words, what’s the prize, or prizes, when you’ve
  completed the goal? If you can’t put into words what the prize is, it’s
  simple: you’re not going to achieve the goal. Again, it boils down to choice.
  “We only do what’s important to us in the moment and it’s the accumulation of
  those ‘one things’ we do in the moment that will either steer us towards our
  goal or away from it,” the book says.


  Kalley continues, “Our reasons for doing what we need to do to achieve our
  goals have to be much bigger than our reasons for not doing those things. They
  have to be so big that they overwhelm all other reasons.” But achieving goals
  is time consuming, and it’s important not to expect instant results. If you
  do, you’ll be disappointed and likely give up. Successful people know how to
  stick with it, even when there doesn’t seem to be a light at the end of the
  tunnel.


  Whatever we choose, “there is no escape from the pain.” The two types of pain
  Kalley describes are **discipline** and **regret**. The pain of discipline is
  all of the hardwork required to attain the desired outcome of the goal. The
  pain of regret is the guilt one has to live with when they don’t attempt their
  goals. Again, the choice is yours and yours alone.

  ### Build A New Muscle


  > "I have spent a lifetime searching for the ‘easy’ method of overcoming years
  of crushing self criticism and I can assure you it is as mythical as a
  unicorn."- Life Sinks or Soars, page 36


  Often the choices we make are a manifestation of how we innately feel about
  ourselves. It’s probably appropriate to say that having self doubt is a common
  human denominator; we all face it to some degree, whether we want to admit it
  or not. However, for some of us, insecurities plague us to such an inordinate
  degree that they can prevent us from being successful in our endeavors. Often
  this feeling is deep-rooted and, like sculpting your body at the gym, the
  desired results take time. This is why Kalley refers to building confidence as
  “building a new muscle”.


  An extreme lack of confidence and/or feelings of unworthiness could have been
  ingrained from a young age, perhaps by someone contending with their own
  demons, telling us that we’d never amount to anything. That manifests itself
  later on, at any given time, when we go to attempt something new. To a lesser
  degree, someone telling us that we’re not good enough at a sport may force us
  to lose all interest in attaining greatness in that particular arena. What
  other people think about us, and what we then think of ourselves, has great
  implications.


  To offer a personal example, recently I have started reading through a list of
  the ‘100 Greatest Books Ever Written,’ hoping that some that some of the
  greatness of these canonized writers will rub off. While immersed in the first
  of these classics, I couldn’t help but think that I’ll never possess the great
  command of the English language that they do. I had to remind myself that
  while I may not be an Emily Bronte or an F. Scott Fitzgerald yet, there’s
  nothing to stop me—except for myself—from excelling and writing my own
  masterpiece. Lofty ambitions I know, but why not shoot for the stars?
f_conclusion: >-
  When I first began reading Rael Kalley’s _Life Sinks or Soars: The Choice is
  Yours_, I felt that perhaps the book’s lessons were too obvious, but I quickly
  changed my mind. They _are_ obvious, but that does not preclude the fact that
  so many people don’t know how the harness the gift of choice that we all
  innately posses. I was immediately reminded of several instances of friends or
  acquaintances saying, “I wish I could do that” or “I wish I could have that”.
  The truth, of course, is that they can. We all have the gift of choice, and
  it’s ours to make.

Rael Kalley takes an interesting approach with his book, _Life Sinks or Soars: The Choice is Yours_. Rather than employing the typical business book conventions, _Life Sinks or Soars_ reads more as a novel. He creates two fictional characters, Hugh and Earl. The two first forged a friendship when Hugh intercepted and prevented Earl from facing the wrath of the schoolyard bullies. Since then, while they have remained friends, life has taken the two men on different paths. Now both middle aged, Hugh can boast success in almost every aspect of his life, including business and family. Earl, on the other hand, has had several unsuccessful businesses, two failed marriages, and is at the end of his rope. Exasperated, he calls Hugh, who hops on the first plane to impart the secrets of his success to his old friend. The ‘secrets’ are universal and applicable to all.

I want to leave you with my favourite quote from the book, one attributed to Aristotle: “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”
