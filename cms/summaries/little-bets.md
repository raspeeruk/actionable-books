  ### Make Little Bets


  > "Little bets are concrete actions taken to discover, test, and develop ideas
  that are achievable and affordable. They begin as creative possibilities that
  get iterated and refined over time, and they are particularly valuable when
  trying to navigate amid uncertainty, create something new, or attend to
  open-ended problems."- Little Bets, page 8


  Sims describes a little bet as “a small affordable risk that anyone can take
  to discover and develop ideas.” As a society we have a notion that we need to
  show commitment in a burn all the bridges kind of way so we can’t turn back on
  our quest in all that we do. In marriage that’s an awesome idea, in picking a
  new marketing strategy it is a bit over the top. Making little bets help to
  show that we can have better results by not applying the all or nothing
  propositions on some projects. Making a little bet doesn’t mean you are not
  committed to an idea, just that you start small and increase over time,
  adjusting your course as you go rather than rigidly sticking to a plan
  outlined from the start. If you make a huge bet from the start, your
  creativity and options are limited, problems arise that you couldn’t have
  conceived of from the start. Conversely, if you start small, get your feet
  wet, and test things out without becoming too invested in a decision, you can
  tinker along the way. This is the advantage of little bets—making progress and
  tweaking as you go—approaching problems in a non-linear manner.


  What makes a little bet? There are no hard and fast rules. Just try something,
  observe, learn, adjust, and repeat. Recognize something may or may not come of
  this and since we are not betting the kid’s college savings on this, that is
  okay. The goal is not to guarantee success but to explore the possibilities in
  a way that doesn’t break the bank.


  Think about any successful venture you’ve had, now how the idea was
  implemented. Did that idea spring forth fully formed as you find it in its
  current state? Unless your name is Athena and claim Zeus as your father,
  probably not. And that is the point, great ideas come with tinkering and time.
  The phrase trial and error is cliché for a reason.


  As Sims explains in the book, this isn’t a revolutionary approach, at some
  time we have all used little bets, to decide that maybe med school wasn’t for
  us (thank you Anat and Phys) or that by listening to a different radio station
  you found out you really enjoy folk music (not a true example). The goal is to
  recognize that little bets are not limited to picking majors and discovering
  new music, they can be used to generate more solutions from every problem.


  To help you do just that I have two suggestions: learning a little from a lot,
  and setting up guard rails.

  ### Set Up Guard Rails


  > "...productively creative people use constraints to limit their focus and
  isolate a set of problems that need to be solved."- Little Bets, page 78


  Sims explains that guard rails or constraints help to define the scope of what
  you are working on. Think of going to the grocery store and looking at the
  chip aisle. How many options are there? Now narrow your focus to just tortilla
  chips, there are still a number of options but you have ruled out enough to
  grant you the ability to focus. Guard rails perform a similar function to a
  little bet, they provide limits that can provide a space in which to create.


  Wait, this seems counterintuitive to everything above doesn’t it? Guard rails
  act as constraints to help define the scope of what you are working on, things
  you can’t change such as a budget or time deadline. Reducing the scope of your
  project helps eliminate the things you don’t need to worry about. Therefore,
  constraints actually provide you with more freedom, as paradoxical as it
  sounds.


  A professor once told me the best advice for taking an exam is to answer the
  question asked. Guard rails help point you to the correct issue, and little
  bets let you solve it in your own manner.

  ### Learn A Little From A Lot


  > "People too often have a tendency to think that certain people, experts or
  mentors for example, have all the answers when in reality insight is far more
  dispersed."- Little Bets, page 120


  How many people have you interacted with today? What did you learn from them?
  How many questions have you asked today? Sims shares the story of the man
  behind the micro-finance movement and how he developed his idea for lending
  small amounts to little businesses in rural economies because of looking at
  things from “worm’s eye view.” It is common to gaze down from the bird’s eye
  view but what is happening on the ground? Learn about what people do, how they
  live, or what interests them. Through asking more questions I’ve recently
  learned that someone I’ve known for a year has written two books and is
  working on a third.


  Little bets hinge on curiosity and by striving to learn more from those around
  you, you’ll have more ideas with which to solve problems—not to mention better
  conversation topics at dinner.

  Remember “most successful entrepreneurs don’t begin with brilliant ideas—they
  discover them.” I’ve tried to make more little bets in my life. They have
  helped me branch out and ask a lot more questions.

Creativity has a mythical elusive quality to it. Almost the unicorn of business, much talked about but little understood, and far too infrequent a companion. In _Little Bets,_ Peter Sims explains that creativity doesn’t need to be so foreign to us. Through a non-linear process of making “little bets”, Sims believes that you can unlock greater access to your creativity.
