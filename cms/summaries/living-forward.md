  ### Invest in the Important


  > "We’re convinced you can do almost anything if you are willing to clarify
  your commitments and make incremental investments over time to achieve them."-
  Living Forward, page 101


  This quote is actually a magic wand in disguise. The proverbial silver bullet.
  First, you need to get clear about what you really want. Then you need to
  commit to making incremental investments over time to generate that success.
  Implement this idea consistently and the magic of compound interest does most
  of the heavy lifting.


  At its most basic, your Life Plan requires you answer three questions:


  1.  How do I want to be remembered (by family, friends, colleagues,
  community)?

  2.  What matters the most (to me)?

  3.  How can I get from where I currently am to where I want to be?


  Hyatt and Harkavy use banking as an analogy to guide your planning. First you
  establish different _Life Accounts_ (who and what is important to you),
  identify your account balance (your current situation) and outline your
  investment goals (your desired future). Then you consider different investment
  strategies (ways to reach your desired future) and decide what you can commit
  to do in order to realize growth in that account (daily/weekly action steps).
  It’s a great metaphor that reminds us we need to actively align our actions
  (our deposits) with what is important to us on a regular basis if we want to
  see progress (wealth creation).


  Getting clear on who and what is important to you, along with the specific
  things you can do daily, weekly and monthly to achieve that vision will make
  it easier to take the next step – eliminating the tasks and activities that
  don’t support your identified priorities to make room for those that do.

  ### Accentuate the Positive


  > "One of the best questions you can ask when something negative happens is:
  What does this experience make possible?"- Living Forward, page 39


  For those of you who may not be naturally optimistic, this is the second magic
  wand hiding up your sleeve. Rather than using valuable and finite energy to
  lament and bemoan something ‘gone wrong’, stop and look for the benefit or
  advantage the situation offers you. Thomas Edison was a master at this. He and
  his team tried 10,000 different combinations of wire filament before
  discovering the one that made the incandescent light possible. They studied
  each setback to glean clues for how to set up the next experiment.


  Michael Hyatt once broke his ankle at what he described as a crazy busy and
  most inopportune time. By asking himself, _What does this experience make
  possible?,_ he was able to recognize it offered him an opportunity to slow
  down, recharge and regain some work-life balance. And, it provided
  opportunities for other team members to grow through new assignments and
  leadership opportunities.


  Answering ‘_What does this experience make possible?’_ forces you to shift
  your focus from the past (which you can do nothing about) to the future which
  you can definitely influence. Looking for the hidden opportunities and
  benefits within our setbacks is the quickest way to turn those lemons into
  lemonade and harness the power of positivity. Remember, the rear view mirror
  is a fraction of the size of the front windshield for a reason!

  ### Create Margin


  > "What we desperately need is margin – time to breathe, to reflect, to act."-
  Living Forward, page 50


  I love the concept of creating margin – some buffer time in our day and week
  where we pause and reconnect to what is important so we can be more deliberate
  about our choices and decisions. Too often we are flying from meeting to
  meeting and task to task with barely time to eat lunch or grab a coffee. We
  react to what gets thrown at us instead of considering whether it’s actually
  worthy of our time and resources. To create margin, we need to adopt three
  essential practices:


  1.  Triage our calendar.

  2.  Schedule our priorities.

  3.  Say no to more requests.


  Triaging your calendar means taking a good hard look at what you do with your
  time and eliminating activities and commitments that don’t add value to your
  life accounts (that’s the saying no part). I have found Dr. Stephen Covey’s
  Urgent/Important matrix a useful tool for gaining some much needed perspective
  on where my time and energy is going. Next we have to ‘selfishly’ schedule
  time to work on our identified priorities first before agreeing to consider
  requests from others. This takes discipline and practice but is well worth the
  effort if you are serious about achieving your dreams.


  Of course, this doesn’t mean that life won’t throw you curveballs. Successful
  people anticipate potential detours and have alternate routes they can choose
  if the need arises. They also make lemonade with life’s lemons.

  Benjamin Franklin and Sir Winston Churchill are both credited with variations
  of the saying, “Those who fail to plan, are planning to fail.” Hyatt and
  Harkavy would say, “Those who fail to plan are doomed to drift through life.”
  Yikes! That’s not what I want my obituary to say! How about you?

  "Life Planning is fundamentally about imagining a better future. It’s about
  breaking free of your limiting beliefs, tapping into your deepest desires, and
  standing in the realm of possibility."

> "Life Planning is fundamentally about imagining a better future. It’s about breaking free of your limiting beliefs, tapping into your deepest desires, and standing in the realm of possibility." _\- Living Forward, page 106_

Chances are good that if you are reading this summary you are interested in creating a more rewarding and fulfilling life. And, if you’re like me, it’s not that your current life sucks. It’s more a feeling that there’s room for improvement.

In _Living Forward_, Michael Hyatt and Daniel Harkavy describe a planning process to help people zero in on what is important to them and commit to actions that will produce their desired outcomes. Many of the concepts they discuss are not new. Other authors have encouraged us to write our eulogy, identify our important roles and relationships, get specific about what success looks like, monitor our progress and adjust our execution to improve results. Hyatt and Harkavy have massaged these concepts into an easy-to-create-and-follow ‘Life Plan’ that should help even the most time-challenged of us take charge of our future and live our dream life today. They share their personal stories and ‘ah-ha’ moments along with sample Life Plans so we learn the process and see the end product. This attention to detail makes for an easy read and a generous dose of inspiration.

While I do a reasonable job of setting goals and pursuing them, Hyatt and Harkavy have inspired me to strengthen my current planning framework by incorporating some of their Life Plan components into it. Whether you need to create a Life Plan from scratch or simply need to tweak your current system to gain better traction, _Living Forward_ will provide you with the tools (and real life examples) to clarify where you want to go so you can develop a doable plan for creating the life you want. As the authors remind us: If you don’t have a plan for your life, you will end up implementing other people’s plans and priorities. Is that really the life you want for yourself?
