  ### Ditch the All or Nothing Mentality


  > "Choose your first step wisely because if it’s not easily achievable, it
  could significantly derail your best efforts. First steps should help you
  build confidence and make you feel like you are a little closer to your
  goal."- Living In Your Top 1%, page 97


  If you’re actually serious about your achieving your goals, ditch the all or
  nothing mentality. Finerman points out that it’s been proven that when you
  take on too much, you’re more inclined to give up.


  Do you ever notice that in the first week of January, the gym is always
  packed? But as the month goes on, the line for the elliptical machine grows
  shorter, and those new faces all but disappear until it’s just the regulars
  left. That’s because those people with the New Year’s Resolutions bit off more
  than they could chew rather than ease into a new routine. Instead of hitting
  the gym maybe twice a week, they went full throttle, 5 days a week at 5.30 in
  the morning before a long day at the office. Tired, cranky, and with sore
  muscles, they’re burnt out as quickly as they began and quit.


  This is analogous to all goals, not just fitness related, and resonated with
  me because it’s something that I’ve struggled with, whether it’s blogging or
  trying a gluten free diet. Start with small, manageable steps. In fact, that’s
  how Alissa Finerman wrote this book. “I started this book with the small step
  of writing one hour each day” (page 103). Once you start seeing progress, you
  will feel inspired to continue, bringing you that much closer to achieving the
  end result.


  The following two Insights will help you stay on track with your goals, and
  ensure that they don’t end up like those resolutions you might have made at
  the beginning of the year.

  ### Harmonious Goals


  > "If you pursue too many goals at the same time that are non-harmonious, you
  will get frustrated when you do not achieve your desired results."- Living In
  Your Top 1%, page 85


  According to Alissa Finerman, prioritizing goals that are harmonious with one
  another is essential to making these goals a reality, as well as helping you
  to live in your 1%. For instance, let’s say two of your tier one goals are
  devoting yourself to the creation of a new business, perhaps one that includes
  a great deal of travel each week, and the other is a desire to increase the
  amount of time that you spend with your family. How will you be home to enjoy
  dinner with your family when you’re on the road travelling? You can’t, and
  these two goals will be in competition with one another, and one will have to
  take precedence over the other. An inability to realize this will lead to
  frustration and disappointment when you fall short of achieving the goal(s).
  As Finerman writes, “This does not mean your goal is a bad goal, it just means
  that the timing may be off, or that you did not take the time to carefully
  think about how to prioritize them” (page 85).


  Finerman says that “cross-checking” your goals will help ensure that they are
  harmonious with one another, increasing the odds that you will be able to
  achieve them, and will help you to stay realistic when prioritizing your
  goals.

  ### Prioritize Your Goals


  > "Setting priorities will help you stay accountable and reduce your stress
  levels. This will help you lay out the best path to living in your top 1%."-
  Living In Your Top 1%, page 89


  We all have goals in our life that we want to bring to fruition. Maybe it’s to
  buy a home, switching to a gluten free diet, or take a long desired trip. We
  may jot them down on paper, or keep them tucked away in the back of our mind.
  But while buying a home and eliminating gluten from your diet could be more
  pressing goals, that dream trip to Egypt to see the pyramids might be
  something to do down the line.


  It’s all about prioritizing what is important to you in your life at this very
  moment. And different people prioritize goals differently. For instance,
  buying a house is more important for a growing family of three in the suburbs
  than it is for a 20-something single career girl in the city. That’s why it’s
  crucial to write down your goals and then organize them. Go through your list
  and rank them by **tiers**. Tier one goals “are the goals that are the most
  meaningful and have the greatest impact on \[your life\]. They are not
  necessarily the goals that help you make the most money or bring a promotion
  but rather the goals that either satisfy your basic survival needs or add a
  greater sense of fulfillment” (page 89).


  This is a critical step and requires a great deal of thought. But when
  deciding which goals are tier one, and which are tier two and so on, just keep
  in mind that it’s what’s important to you _right now_. Understanding this will
  help you realize the goals that are most imperative, with the rest falling
  into place when the time is right.

  As Finerman points out to her reader, “Living in your top 1% is a continuous
  journey rather than a race with a start and finish” (page 11). And
  prioritizing your goals is only one component to living in your top 1%, just
  as goals are only a small part of the book, which is broken down into three
  sections: _Assess_, _Create_ and _Implement_, which are broken down further
  into three rituals per section. What we’ve covered here in this Actionable
  Summary is just the tip of the iceberg. Pick up _Living in Your Top 1%_ and
  discover what _your_ top 1% looks like.

Therein lies the overarching theme of Alissa Finerman’s inspiring first book, _Living In Your Top 1%._ There is so much emphasis today on competition with others, but Finerman argues that competing with yourself should be your top priority. Finerman, a former professional tennis player turned Wall Street professional turned life coach/speaker, knows this all too well. She left cutthroat Wall Street and moved to sunny Los Angeles to become an accredited coach, transforming not only her own life, but the lives of countless others. It was there that she finally began living a more authentic life, and making more of her dreams a reality. “What is it that makes some people reach high than others who are equipped with the same resources?” she asks at the beginning of the book. “The idea of living in your top 1% evolved from this question” (page 4). One of the ingredients is goal setting, and this is the focus of our summary.
