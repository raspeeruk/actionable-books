  ### Get More with Less


  > "The 80/20 principle says that a small minority of causes lead to a large
  majority of results. If we know what results we want, therefore, we can look
  for a super-productive way to get those results."- Living the 80/20 Way, page
  22


  How is this possible? How can you get more enjoyment, pleasure, results with
  less? The key is to eliminate, reduce and cut out all unnecessary activities
  to focus on the critical few that have the biggest impact. By focusing on
  these few high-powered activities, your results can improve dramatically,
  providing a huge return on your time investment. The author makes a convincing
  case that by leaving something out we can achieve more and provides countless
  examples in the fields of science, technology and business.


  Obviously the first place to start is a search for low-effort, high reward
  activities. Eliminate all non-value added tasks that do not contribute to the
  end result. The author suggests we keep questioning ourselves and
  brainstorming to find a better way of getting what we want. We can do this by
  asking ourselves some key questions such as ‘What are the things that truly
  produce results in your work?’ Given your specific skill set, ‘Where could you
  create the most value?’


  Koch also provides a list of high-payoff habits that generate huge returns for
  the time invested in doing them. The list includes some familiar ones such as
  exercise, meditation and saving a portion of your earnings. But what makes the
  list interesting is that it also includes activities that are not so obvious,
  such as doing a daily unselfish act and focusing on what matters to you.

  ### Live in the present


  > "Act less, think more. Reflect on what really matters to you. Stop doing
  anything that isn’t valuable, that doesn’t make you happy. Savor life."-
  Living the 80/20 Way, page 41


  Managing time in our ever changing world is a no-win situation. We’re always
  looking to do more with the elusive reward that relaxation is just around the
  corner, but something else always pops up. Koch believes we should change our
  beliefs about time management and thinks that “it is because we have so much
  time that we squander it.”


  When we are focused on what truly matters and expending our efforts on the
  most rewarding activities, we don’t worry about lack of time or whether we’re
  doing the right thing or not. We’re completely absorbed in what we’re doing
  and enjoying every moment of it. Koch refers to this as being “more connected
  to what is going on now and to other people.” If we slowed down and did fewer
  things, our happiness would increase and our time management obsession would
  disappear.

  ### Find your Happy Place


  > "A few things that we experience and do, in very little time, are of
  enormous value. We get a fantastic return on our time when 20 percent of time
  leads to 80 percent of happiness or achievement—we get a fourfold or 400
  percent return on this time."- Living the 80/20 Way, page 35


  Following the 80/20 principle of more is less, Koch invites us to find our
  happiness islands and increase our time spent on them. He defines these
  happiness boosters as “the small dollops of time—the special, glorious
  times—when we’re happiest.”


  He asks the reader to reflect on a recent enjoyable and happy experience and
  find a common denominator. What did these happy moments have in common? Can
  they be repeated? Once you’ve figured out your happiness islands, then the
  goal becomes to increase their occurrence and time spent on them.


  The author also recommends identifying “activities that have a poor return on
  happiness for the time spent.” Are we doing something out of a sense of duty?
  If a task provides no pleasure, can we eliminate it?


  Taking this a step further, he suggests we think about our achievement
  islands. These would be “the small time periods when you are your most
  productive or creative: when you get more with less, accomplishing the most
  with little apparent effort in very little time.”


  You’ve probably heard of flow or being in the zone which is similar to
  achievement islands. What do they have in common so as to increase their
  frequency? These activities can include writing, selling, planning etc.
f_conclusion: >-
  Incorporating these 80/20 recommendations takes courage and a little thinking
  outside the box to do things differently. But don’t let that scare you; as
  Koch remarks “to take action that will lead to the best life you can make
  requires some new and different effort.” Find your happy place and start doing
  more with less.

  "To find meaning in life, we have to reach inside ourselves: define the few
  things that we care about, the things we want to love and devote ourselves to,
  the things we are good at and enjoy. Having found these things, everything
  else is trivial."

_Living the 80/20 Way: Work Less, Worry Less, Succeed More, Enjoy More_ by Richard Koch is about results and planning your life to focus on what produces those results. 80/20 is based on the Pareto Principle which states that 20% of actions produce 80% of the results. Only a critical few activities produce the outcomes that really matter.

Richard Koch is an entrepreneur and author of several books on the 80/20 principle. His current book is a follow-up to his previous bestseller _The 80/20 Principle,_ which was targeted at businesses and professionals. This book is filled with many practical examples and methods to incorporate the 80/20 principle into your personal life and includes questions to help the reader figure out what really matters.
