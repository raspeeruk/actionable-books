  ### Money First . . . Not!


  > "I have never gone into any business purely to make money. If that is the
  sole motive then I believe you are better off not doing it. A business has to
  be involving; it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative
  instincts."- Losing My Virginity, page 58


  Make no mistake: Branson likes money, and knows that a business which doesn’t
  make money is a hobby. But read the accounts of how every business from Virgin
  Records to Virgin Rail was conceived, and **you see a trail, not of money but
  of passion.** Passion balanced by a deep understanding of the principles of
  good business, as insight #1 shows.

  ### There is No Formula


  > "I don't believe it can be taught as if it were a recipe. There aren't
  ingredients and techniques that will guarantee success. Parameters exist that,
  if followed, will ensure a business can continue, but you cannot clearly
  define our business success and then bottle it as you would a perfume. It's
  not that simple: to be successful, you have to be out there, you have to hit
  the ground running; and, if you have a good team round you and more than your
  fair share of luck, you might make something happen. But you certainly can't
  guarantee it just by following someone else's formula. Business is a fluid,
  changing substance."- Losing My Virginity, page 397


  Rules are crutches for the lazy and ignorant. Educate yourself. Commit to hard
  work. Build a team instead of going it alone. Keep your eyes and mind open.


  Richard Branson didn’t come from wealth, he made it for himself. He made his
  success by following the **simple principles** he shares in a single
  paragraph.


  If you’re not as successful as you’d like to be, look at your
  **implementation** of those simple principles and see where you’re lacking.
  **Find team members who excel where you’re weak and invest them with trust.**


  Rules have exceptions. Principles, properly applied, are universal.

  ### "It is Only by Being Bold That You Get Anywhere"


  > "I know that it is only by being bold that you get anywhere. If you are a
  risk-taker, then the art is to protect the downside. It seemed to us that
  Tubular Bells was so good that we could promote it ourselves. I felt sure that
  it would sell enough copies to pay back our investment."- Losing My Virginity,
  page 127


  Virgin Records was founded on a **riskier but more profitable model.** The
  reasoning was that if they produced great music with wide appeal, everyone
  would win. Their confidence in artists like Mike Oldfield, Sting, The Sex
  Pistols, and others reflected, not just good business sense, but Branson’s
  ongoing **ability to share the glory** with others. This first successful
  Virgin company, Branson repeats throughout the book, would have been
  impossible without the incisive musical sense of co-founder Simon Draper. And
  of course, selling millions and millions of copies of Oldfield’s _Tubular
  Bells_ over the years protected the downside when signing groups like The Sex
  Pistols.


  Know the risks, certainly, but don’t let them deter you. Instead, recognize
  the slippery spots, the gaps. Put **sensible precautions** in place to
  mitigate the downside and to reduce the worst-case scenario to manageable
  proportions. Once you’ve done that, monitor those systems, but **dive in with
  all your heart** because “it is only by being bold that you get anywhere.”
f_conclusion: >-
  It seems too good to be true: follow your passions and become a billionaire.
  Of course, that’s not really what Branson did.

I was astonished to discover that this 600-page book could be boiled down to a handful of business principles. A separate lesson all its own, you’ll realize as you read _Losing My Virginity_ that Richard Branson, rebel that he is, rebels in a consistent and predictable manner.

Raised by parents who constantly challenged him, beaten down by teachers who were clueless about his learning disabilities, Branson’s youth gave him a **balance of determination and joy.** His businesses have all been an extension of his personality. While it’s easy to dismiss advice like “have fun, be creative, follow your dreams” as new-age nonsense, it’s hard to argue with the success of the man who has launched **more billion-dollar businesses than anyone in history.**

Because his success is, not just well-known, but the stuff of legend, I’ll include more extensive quotes than usual, and keep my comments to a minimum. He can speak for himself.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Money First . . . Not!

Richard Branson didn’t come from wealth, he made it for himself. He made his success by following the **simple principles** he shares in a single paragraph.

If you’re not as successful as you’d like to be, look at your **implementation** of those simple principles and see where you’re lacking. **Find team members who excel where you’re weak and invest them with trust.**

Rules have exceptions. Principles, properly applied, are universal.

It seems too good to be true: follow your passions and become a billionaire. Of course, that’s not really what Branson did.

But it’s **part** of what he did.

What Branson’s life proves is that wildly successful businesses **can** be built from passion, if it’s supported by common sense, hard work, a great team, and a little serendipity.

Of course, the same could be said for building a business doing something you hate. Common sense, hard work, a great team, a little serendipity – you could still succeed.

Would you be as happy? Richard Branson and I don’t think so.
