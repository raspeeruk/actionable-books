  ### The Voice Engine


  > "Developing your authentic voice is not just about personal gratification.
  It's about achieving impact. In order to do that, your work must resonate with
  others. You must be mindful of not only what you want to communicate but also
  how it will be received by your audience."- Louder than Words


  The idea of the “Voice Engine” explains the three interlocking components of
  an authentic voice: identity, vision and mastery. Identity is the idea of who
  you truly are. What experiences, passions, challenges and hopes define you and
  cause you to strive towards a vision and mastery? Your **identity** is the
  core of authenticity because pursuing work which you do not genuinely identify
  with can never be authentic.


  **Vision** is the destination you strive for in your work. It’s the place
  where you want your audience (customers, readers, clients, etc.) to come to
  through your work. Vision is less a specific goal than a North Star to guide
  you along the path.


  **Mastery** is the way you grow in the skills of your craft to deliver your
  vision. This comes from practicing core competencies, emulating existing great
  work and regularly taking smart risks to advance your craft. Mastery is not a
  destination but an unending journey of improvement.


  Henry posits that any great work requires the creator to have identity, vision
  and mastery. Whenever we’re “stuck” in life or work, it’s helpful to consider
  each area to hone in on the sticking point. For example:


  *   If the project we’re working on is unfulfilling it likely doesn’t align
  with our identity.

  *   If a team is working hard but feels aimless then a lack of vision is
  likely to blame.

  *   If the work feels important but we’re not achieving the results we want
  it’s likely a lack of mastery. We don’t have the skills needed to achieve the
  vision yet, which results in an “aspiration gap.”

  ### Define Your Intended Audience


  > "The most important method for refining your vision is to closely and
  specifically define your intended audience."- Louder than Words, page 105


  The idea of knowing your audience isn’t new but Henry places extra emphasis on
  it in the context of our authentic voice. He provides some excellent guiding
  principles for thinking through the intended audience of any project:


  *   Think of a specific person rather than traits when thinking and talking
  about your intended audience. Your audience is made up of individuals who you
  need to relate to rather than demographics like married men age 30 to 45 with
  children. The person would ideally be someone you know and can reasonably ask
  “what would they think of this?”

  *   Your intended audience should feel like whatever you’re creating was made
  for them personally. Remembering that you are connecting your vision with real
  people helps clarify your actions and thinking.

  *   Don’t change your intended audience in the middle of a project. If you
  find that what you’re working on won’t work for the audience you planned,
  making slight adjustments for a different audience is unlikely to be
  successful. Pause and take the time to consider the new audience from the
  beginning and don’t be afraid to toss completed work that is no longer
  relevant.


  Henry provides some guiding questions to help us think through our intended
  audience:


  *   Who is your intended audience for a project you’re working on?

  *   What are you trying to achieve for them?

  *   What expectations will they have and how can you exceed them?

  *   How can I surprise and delight my audience in unexpected ways?

  ### Commit to a Path


  > "If you try to be effective at everything you will be effective at nothing.
  You must choose a path. This is the first and most significant responsibility
  of any creative professional and it's the origin of all unique authentic
  voices."- Louder than Words, page 82


  It’s always difficult to turn down opportunity but it is required to develop a
  truly authentic voice. Bouncing from area to area or trying to “do it all”
  precludes the possibility of becoming excellent and providing the unique value
  we are all capable of creating. This is not to say that you should be myopic
  and ignore the world around you. Quite the opposite. **You must choose a path
  to the exclusion of others but your voice is unlikely to resonate if you shut
  everything out.**


  Have you committed to a path? Or are you pulled in every direction in your
  work, always chasing the next “thing.” Building an authentic voice takes
  patience and effort over time so consider carefully the path (or lack thereof)
  that you’re on.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Louder than Words_ is an excellent read because it helps tie many of the
  philosophical ideas behind the nature of work with practical tips for
  achieving an authentic voice. I would recommend this to any creative
  professional (artists, designers, entrepreneurs, etc.) but would especially
  recommend it to those who don’t consider themselves in a creative field.
  Thinking about the voice behind our work is essential to personal fulfillment
  and professional achievement in any field, but those who consider themselves
  “non-creative” may actual take away more from the book.
f_quote-2: >-
  "Many people operate in ‘default mode,’ and they ignore their hunches, their
  deeper intuition, and their unique vision, and instead settle into the fold.
  Over time, they become more of a reflection of everyone around them – or a
  faded photocopy of a photocopy – than an original source of ideas, energy and
  life."

Todd Henry’s _Louder than Words_ reminds the reader about the essential nature of our authentic voice. The core idea is that each of us has something unique to contribute in our professional and personal lives. Stifling or ignoring this true voice is a recipe for a half-life of sorts where we miss the opportunity to achieve a deeper purpose. Henry defines voice “as the expression (idea) you make through a medium (platform) in order to achieve a desired outcome (result).” Everyone from artists and writers to engineers and lawyers have an authentic voice which is required to achieve the best outcomes.

_Louder than Words_ draws inspiration from an almost spiritual view of work and life but is really more of practical handbook than an existential tome. The books is filled with relevant stories and exercises to guide an individual and team-leader through finding and utilizing their authentic voice.

Do you feel like you are using your authentic voice fully in your work in life? What areas of identity, vision and mastery can you focus on more to let your authentic voice resonate?
