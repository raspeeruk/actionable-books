  ### Journey of a Warrior


  > "I see your pain. It’s real. I feel it too. We can handle it baby. We can do
  hard things. Because we are Warriors."- Love Warrior, page 205


  Life is meant to be felt. The emotional spectrum is wide and unhindered, and
  the trajectory of our story is influenced by ever changing factors for which
  we have varying levels of control. Melton’s story moves from body image
  challenges, to dependency challenges, to martial strife and sometimes back
  again, illustrating that there are no quick fixes, no promised happy endings,
  and no human who goes unaffected by the “tough stuff”. Embracing the Journey
  of a Warrior means building resiliency, riding the wave and loving yourself
  and those most important to you in a forgiving and unwavering way.


  It is tempting to downplay our pain in favor of a more positive outward facing
  story or in an attempt to shield the more innocent from pain that is to come,
  but a Warrior would wear the pain, manage the narrative and embrace their
  ever-changing story of life long fulfillment.

  ### Beauty


  > "Beautiful women glow. When you are with a beautiful woman you might not
  notice her hair or skin or body or clothes, because you’ll be distracted by
  the way she makes you feel. She will be so full of beauty that you will see
  some of it overflow onto you… because beautiful, wise women know the quickest
  way to fill up with beauty is to soak in another human being… The most
  beautiful women take their time with other people. They are filling up."- Love
  Warrior, page 255


  Melton shares her struggles with body image and her identity as a woman
  throughout the memoir. She reflects specifically on the challenges of raising
  empowered little girls when she herself often struggles with empowerment. She
  identifies the root of her issue as the transition from adolescent to
  adulthood and the challenges of a changing body and shifting societal
  expectations. Throughout the memoir it is as if her power is building, through
  crisis she discovers a strong identity and begins to hold fiercely to her new
  definition of what it means to be a woman and a Warrior.


  While redefining beauty for herself, to be less dependent on appearance and
  how others define you, she is faced with an opportunity to model this for her
  daughters. When she finds them discussing the merits of the word ‘sexy’ it
  opens a larger conversation over definitions and expectations. Melton
  explains, “Pretty is another thing that can be sold. What and who is pretty is
  also something those people in boardrooms decide. It’s always changing. So if
  what you want to be is pretty, you’ll have to keep changing… What I want to
  be, girls, is beautiful… Beautiful is what you are made of.” The challenge of
  continued self-discovery is heightened when we are also faced with the lofty
  responsibility of parenting and/or role modeling, but Melton’s authenticity
  and her openness to continual learning and reflection serves as inspiration
  for her little women, and her readers. After all, empowered women empower
  women.

  ### What You Know


  > "I force myself to translate the unanswerable into an answerable."- Love
  Warrior, page 140


  When crisis or tragedy strikes, often the most challenging part is that it was
  unanticipated. Being in the know and managing the narrative can be a valuable
  piece of control amongst the chaos. Melton’s coping skills were inspired by
  vulnerability and provide meaningful perspective for her readers. Her mantra
  was shared as follows:


  1.  _What you don’t know you’re not suppose to know yet._

  2.  _More will be revealed._

  3.  _Crisis comes from the word meaning to sift. Let it all fall away and
  you’ll be left with what matters._

  4.  _What matters most cannot be taken away._

  5.  _Just do the next right thing one thing at a time. That’ll take you all
  the way home._


  Melton builds resilience slowly but surely, not by taking it one day at a time
  but rather each tiny step piece by piece, making it manageable and allowing
  her to build control over her own trajectory. Readers can borrow this shared
  mantra when faced with challenge and find comfort in the answerable amongst
  all the unanswerable that crisis may bring.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are no promised rainbows at the end of this story. The storm is shared
  in full and the vulnerability is felt but at the end of it all, this memoir is
  a story of resiliency, strength and beauty. It may not all be outwardly
  actionable, but it encourages readers to re-examine how they manage crisis,
  the narrative they take from each new challenge, and explores new
  relationships with control and beauty.

> "We know what the world wants from us. We know we must decide whether to stay small, quiet and uncomplicated or allow ourselves to grow as big, loud and complex as we were made to be." _\- Love Warrior, page 11_

It’s easy to get wrapped up in the beautifully raw and emotional memoir Glennon Doyle Melton shares with her readers, but _Love Warrior_ is so much more. It is an invitation for all of us to reassess how we handle life’s tragic moments, how we capture opportunities for deeper self-discovery and how we leverage our support networks to rise up and onwards. Melton’s compelling ability to be unapologetically candid makes her story all the more actionable, by proxy she encourages her readers to feel deeply, project real beauty and be our truest selves. “_Love, Pain, Life: I am not afraid. I was born to do this.”_
