  ### More Powerful than Price?


  > "A business revolution is changing all the rules of the marketplace. Power
  is shifting from manufacturers and retailers directly to consumers, freshly
  enabled with information, choice and connectivity. Price, service, quality and
  design advantages are no longer enough to win. How consumers feel about
  you-their emotional connection to you is what determines success now"- Kevin
  Roberts from a previous interview


  It turns out that we, the new consumers, are not willing to passively accept
  whatever comes our way anymore. We now realise the number of options we have.
  We have so many options, in fact, that price, packaging and performance of
  products and services are pretty much guaranteed with any product on the
  shelves. Which means that consumers are searching for something more. We still
  want to differentiate; we still want to connect. Enter the Lovemark. The three
  qualities which separate a Lovemark from a brand are **mystery**,
  **sensuality** and **intimacy**.


  _“A crucial problem for brands in their battle against commodification is
  their growing apart from consumers. Distant, undifferentiated, unremarkable.”_

  ### Communication is a two way street


  > "Listening is something most brands are not great at. They evolved alongside
  the mass media, and that’s where they stayed. Talking, talking, talking. The
  fragmentation of media demands a fresh approach. And this is where Lovemarks
  come in. Not to abandon the mass market, but to transform it with multiple
  emotional connections."- Lovemarks, page 133


  A new kind of reinvigorated respect is one of the founding principles of
  Lovemarks. Roberts urges us to consider understanding and cultivating consumer
  respect in business; the kind of respect that expands our business metrics
  beyond products, price, performance and profits, and into the world of
  engagement, creating intimacy, earning trust and inspiring love.


  Roberts shares a unique set of principles, upon which he believes we need to
  build our business code of conduct. That is, if we want to avoid being a
  “going nowhere brand” and become a Lovemark. Those principles consist of:


  *   Perform, perform, perform

  *   Pursue Innovation

  *   Commit to total commitment

  *   Make it easy

  *   Don’t hide

  *   Jealously guard your reputation

  *   Get in the lead and stay there

  *   Tell the truth

  *   Nurture integrity

  *   Accept responsibility

  *   Never pull back on service

  *   Deliver great design

  *   Don’t underestimate value

  *   Deserve trust

  *   Never, ever fail the reliability test

  ### Go Deep


  > "Human beings are powered by emotion not reason. People are overwhelmed by
  the choices they face. Human attention has become our principal currency."-
  Lovemarks, page 33


  Here’s the thing – attention is hard to earn these days. And it’s fleeting;
  easily replaced by the next “new thing”. To create lasting relationships with
  their customers, marketers must shift from trying to “capture attention” to
  creating emotional connections with consumers. Robert asserts that one time
  consumers of commodities have higher expectations now and need emotional pull
  to help them make decisions. New consumers want to find ways to connect with
  everything in their lives, including brands. So brands need to become
  Lovemarks.


  _“The big question: Have brands themselves changed? Or is it the other way
  around? Has what people want from brands changed?”_
f_conclusion: >-
  _Lovemarks: the future beyond brands_ is a visually stunning, sensual book,
  the design of which serves to accentuate the underlying message within its
  pages. In it, Kevin Roberts seeks to empower business owners, marketers and
  difference makers to examine their business ideals and develop
  transformational ideas. By codifying what has defined the truly great brands
  we love – and inspiring us to think about what the world needs now – Roberts
  has set out to help business make the world a better place.

> "Lovemarks are the brands, events and experiences that people love. Not just like or admire but love passionately. For great brands to survive they must create loyalty beyond reason in consumers." _\- Lovemarks, inside cover_

Kevin Roberts CEO of worldwide Saatchi & Saatchi first described his Lovemarks theory in 2000. He boldly said that if they wanted to survive, great brands needed to create ‘loyalty beyond reason’ and that this was the only way to differentiate themselves in the future.

Lovemarks explores the concept of what the brands of today and tomorrow will look, sound and feel like. As Roberts explains in the book, the secret to this differentiation is a passionate commitment to three powerful concepts in everything the brand does and represents. The combination of these three qualities separates _Lovemarks_ from brands: Mystery, Sensuality and Intimacy.
