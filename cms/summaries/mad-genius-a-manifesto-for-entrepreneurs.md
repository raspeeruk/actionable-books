  ### The process of genius


  > "The power of curiosity to drive innovation, critical thinking and
  creativity cannot be overstated."- Mad Genius, page 142


  Too often when we have a problem to solve we put our creative hats on, have a
  think-tank, brainstorm ideas and identify the best tactic to resolve the
  issue. Sound about right? Well, imagine if next time a challenge popped up,
  you and your team resisted developing strategies, and instead, stepped back
  and did some critical thinking? Take a minute.


  All right. Gage dares us to think about how to develop a focus within our
  business and corporate endeavours that teach behaviour and mindset centred
  around “innovation, market disruption, break-through products, brilliant
  marketing, industry reinvention and iconic branding”, all of which he sees as
  essential aspects of Mad Genius thinking.


  Just like artists, Gage believes true entrepreneurs have the ability to create
  things that have never existed before. They imagine big ideas that seize
  attention, attract large audiences and impact individuals because of the
  relevance it provides on a personal level. Mad Geniuses do this by revealing
  and creating possibilities.


  Thought leaders Steve Jobs, Nicolas Hayek, Seth Godin and Steven Pressfield
  feature in _Mad Genius_, adding personal insight and experience to the idea
  that the process of genius centres around knowing what your customers want the
  moment they discover it exists.


  You may be thinking “hmmmm, genius just isn’t my thing”. But, as an
  entrepreneur it is now your time to start thinking creatively by being
  curious, being bold and asking yourself:


  *   “What is the desired outcome here?”

  *   “Who is the real target market?”

  *   “What are the actual benefits for the people in the target group?”

  *   “What’s the big idea?”

  *   “What is the story that the will communicate the big idea?”


  Of course, like all new processes, _Mad Genius_ will definitely need practice.
  But get started with the confidence and belief from the author that “There has
  never been a goal worth achieving that didn’t warrant some failure along the
  way.”

  ### Create possibilities


  > "Not everything you try will work, but that’s not the point. The point is
  that you’re in the game, doing things, moving forward. You’ll learn as much
  from your failures as from your successes. Celebrate it all."- Mad Genius,
  page 128


  It becomes clear through Gage’s ideas that empowering people to create a
  possibility leads to a completely different, forward-thinking perspective
  being established. Consider “why no is never the answer…and failure isn’t
  final until you quit”. I know, intriguing concept, right?


  As we have seen, problem solving is inherently reactive. To create
  possibilities, Gage introduces _The Possibility-Thinking Model_ discussed to
  help entrepreneurs


  move from traditional “tactic-style” problem solving, towards a mindset for
  the future. That is, recognising and embracing challenges as opportunities
  that create possibilities.


  To begin creating entrepreneurial possibilities, you will need to “stop living
  in the problem and live in the solution instead”, Gage says. Think about these
  questions and then ask more:


  *   What is the one development that could disrupt our industry and make our
  organisation irrelevant?

  *   What process could we change to make it easier for our customers to do
  business with us?


  A word of caution. Do not fall into the trap of thinking about modifying or
  altering an idea that already exists in your business. By taking this
  approach, your creativity is actually being _adaptive_ not _innovative_
  according to Gage. Instead, think about creating something totally new,
  something exclusive that has not existed before.


  For real breakthroughs, and to really harness your Mad Genius, schedule
  “thinking time” or get out of bed earlier.

  ### Find curious


  > "The smarter you are, the greater the likelihood you are intellectually
  lazy. Don’t be."- Mad Genius, page 108


  There’s no step-by-step process in the book specifying how we begin tapping
  into creative brilliance or unleashing Mad Genius. As a remarkable, critical
  thinker, Gage offers a vibrant storm of ideas that he believes will help
  people in “becoming amazing”, and within Book Three: The Age of the
  Entrepreneur, the importance of cultivating Mad Genius, and why we should, is
  compelling. So where to begin?


  First, make it practice in your organisation that whenever a new idea is
  raised, the initial team response is positive, encouraging and cultivates the
  idea. Move automatic “no” from your team’s reactions and replace it with a
  “tell me more” mindset. Explain that this new rule will help change thought
  patterns, which, the more disrupted, the more likely Mad Genius will be
  unlocked.


  Next, bring focus to the characteristics of creative people. Gage lists these
  qualities as being:


  *   Self motivated

  *   Independent

  *   Delighted by novelty

  *   Risk takers

  *   Tolerant of ambiguity

  *   Deeply involved in their work

  *   Avid readers

  *   World travellers


  Finally, introduce _The Creativity Triad_: three key elements necessary to
  foster ongoing curiosity and build creative genius:


  1.  **_Experience_** – Through travel, learning a new language, studying other
  cultures or meeting new people, you build “a kaleidoscope of interesting and
  different experiences”.

  2.  **_A Capturing system_** – Use a notebook to record ideas and creativity.
  With no interruptions or distractions from ever present smartphone and tablet
  technology, the action of writing on paper keeps you alone with your thoughts.

  3.  **_Taking action_** – It’s not just enough to daydream it. Creativity
  requires you to actually do something about it.


  The approach of world-renowned performance troop, Cirque de Soleil is a
  parallel reference in _Mad Genius_ that highlights the success and achievement
  you will make when you rediscover your hidden child and the artistic genius
  you may have lost touch with. So get curious!
f_conclusion: >-
  Sometimes in life and business, Gage has a valid point. We do settle. We
  decide it’s best to play it safe. Fortunately, this “manifesto”, a follow up
  to _Risky is the New Safe_, provides the inspiration to help us face
  challenges, modify our strategies, gain new knowledge, and begin practicing
  entrepreneurial character traits that we will eventually become great at. _Mad
  Genius_ encourage us to take risks. “_It’s never easy, but it’s worth it_.”

  "This is a manifesto for managers who want to become leaders and leaders who
  are prepared to lead in an age of exponential disruption. Because whether you
  work in a traditional business…or are a government official…the best way to
  create fresh and innovative solutions is to think like an entrepreneur."

> "This is a manifesto for managers who want to become leaders and leaders who are prepared to lead in an age of exponential disruption.

_Mad Genius: A Manifesto for Entrepreneurs_ is not your average motivational business book. Best-selling author and keynote speaker Randy Gage unleashes a thought-provoking, sometimes uncomfortable but definitely inspiring guide, that explores the mysterious concept of genius, a perceived hidden talent he suggests too many of us credit to someone else instead of discovering it within ourselves.

Keeping it concise with just three core sections in the book, Gage argues the point that entrepreneurial success is not just to do with money, or the lack of it, rather that business failure is in fact due to “an idea shortage”. He also reveals how ideas are born and the role they play in entrepreneurial thinking, and why “challenges” offer enormous potential for innovation and creativity.
