  ### Overcome Your Fears


  > "Many of us fear that if we slow down even the tiniest bit, we will no
  longer be productive."- Make It Happen, page 8


  Casey’s personal story is one of overcoming her fears. Throughout her adult
  life, she struggled with a strong desire to be perfect in her endeavors – to
  have the perfect body, to have the perfect life, to have the perfect business.
  These are all illusive ideas of what we think we should be striving for, but
  really they are fueled by our fears. But as Casey points out, “fear can hold
  us back from making what matters happen”.


  The core of living a life on purpose is about knowing what matters most and
  pursuing them in the face of your fears. Casey points out that it is important
  to recognize the difference between normal and abnormal fear. “Normal fear
  keeps us from jumping off a cliff; abnormal fear keeps us from taking a leap
  of faith towards something that matters”. Abnormal fear is also what convinces
  us that what matters most is not actually important. It makes us dim ourselves
  down for no good reason. Interestingly, Casey talks about fear of success as
  being one of the biggest internalized fears that women have. I can relate to
  that. When we fear success, we often really fear that if we reach our
  potential then we won’t be able to manage the responsibility that comes with
  it, or that we won’t be able to sustain it. The repercussion of this kind of
  thinking is that we deem ourselves unworthy and keep playing small.

  ### Create a Life on Purpose


  > "Focus on progress, not paralyzing perfection."- Make It Happen, page 145


  In addition to sharing her inspiring personal story, Casey offers readers some
  practical advice for creating a life they love on purpose. “What seeds can you
  plant now of the living legacy you want to pass on to others?” That is the
  question that Casey suggests thinking about first as you try to determine what
  is most important to you. In addition to that, Casey offers up five steps to
  create a life on purpose:


  1.  **Evaluate your life.** In this part of the process, Casey suggests doing
  a holistic check-in with yourself. How are you? What has been working? What
  hasn’t been working? What are you afraid of? What season are you in? Once
  you’ve done some reflecting on these questions, be still and be patient as you
  decide your next steps.

  2.  **Clear the clutter.** Our lives are sometimes overrun by weeds, which can
  be boiled down into three categories: connectivity, comparison and clutter.
  Once we identify the weeds in our lives we can begin to pull them.

  3.  **Set purposeful goals.** As we decide what goals would most add purpose
  and meaning to our lives, it is important to set both short-term and long-term
  goals. More importantly, when we identify the goals we want to pursue, we
  should also identify why we want to pursue them.

  4.  **Take action.** Break down your goals into daily, weekly and monthly
  action steps. Leave room for evaluation each month and identify things that
  need to be pruned.

  5.  **Engage others.** To continue to cultivate meaningful relationships in
  our lives that add value and purpose, we have to encourage others.


  Casey provides many valuable and inspirational lessons about creating a life
  that matters. Her inspiring story shows us that a combination of faith and
  action makes the impossible possible.

  ### Busy Does Not Equal Success


  > "Busy is the enemy of peace. Don’t be afraid to put the brakes on."- Make It
  Happen, page 97


  I have read countless books about time management over the years and one of
  the recurring themes in all of them is that we have to defeat the notion that
  being busy is an indication of success. Usually the conversation centers on
  the fact that we need to let go of just aimlessly filling our time so that we
  can focus on our priorities. But what Casey points out that is unique to this
  conversation is that busy disrupts the peace of our lives. It’s not just about
  focusing on the tasks that matter most; it’s about cultivating peace in our
  day-to-day. This is completely counterintuitive to how we usually think about
  the benefits of overturning the notion of “busy.” As I tried implementing this
  in my own life, I’ve found it incredibly liberating. It took a bit of time to
  adjust to having quieter, slower days where I just focus on three to five key
  tasks, but I’ve found that I have made a much more significant strides in my
  work.


  Casey suggests that if the goal is progress, not perfection, there are a
  couple of questions that we can focus on to simplify.


  1.  Why am I doing things the way I do them?

  2.  How can I simplify?

  3.  How can I live more on purpose?
