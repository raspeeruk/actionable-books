  ### To change a habit takes time


  > "Habit change isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon."- Making Habits, Breaking
  Habits, page 190


  For some time now, I have tucked in a corner of my brain the random fact that
  it takes twenty-one days to form a new habit. I have no idea where I first
  picked up this trivia tidbit, but if you Google “How long does it take to form
  a new habit,” this is the number that will pop up. One of the things I’ve
  learned from reading Mr. Dean’s book, and of course I left the research up to
  him, is that the twenty-one day benchmark applies to forming habits that are
  relatively simple; like wanting to drink a glass of water after breakfast. For
  anything more complicated, it is likely to take much longer. In fact the
  number of days is more likely to be around sixty six, not twenty-one.


  Although this number of days seems daunting, the author explains that “it is
  possible to bend habits to your will — and become happier, more creative, and
  more productive.” And so, I stepped back from the dinner table and continued
  reading.

  ### Breaking a bad habit requires a replacement habit


  > "Successfully breaking a habit is much more likely when you have a shiny
  new, well–planned habit to focus on rather than just thinking about
  suppressing the old habit."- Making Habits, Breaking Habits, page 161


  Whenever I have tried to break a bad habit I haven’t thought about replacing
  it with something else. I just want the nail biting to stop and so I try to
  stop doing it. I haven’t thought about whenever I feel the urge to bite my
  nails I should have some alternative behavior in mind to do instead. But, this
  is exactly what is suggested in this book. In fact, the following analogy,
  made this very clear to me:


  _“Think of the bad habit you want to change like a river that’s been following
  the same course for a long time. Now you want to stop it suddenly. You can’t
  just dam the river because the water will rise up and break through. Instead,
  you have to encourage the river to take a different course.”_


  Perhaps you are thinking that this sounds easy, but when you are sitting there
  in your kitchen, reaching for the second bag of chips, it doesn’t feel very
  doable. Mr. Dean suggests that “the beauty of habits is that, as they develop,
  they become effortless.” This is encouraging. Take it one day at a time and
  each day you stop yourself from reaching for the junk food the easier it will
  be the next day.

  ### Don’t try to change all your bad habits at once


  > "One response to being unhappy with ourselves is to go for a complete
  reinvention – try to avoid this."- Making Habits, Breaking Habits, page 135


  Before you know it, we will all be ringing in the New Year and with it, some
  of us will be making our New Year’s resolutions. You know the drill. We think
  about all the things we are unhappy with; lack of exercise, not enough time
  with family, weight gain, smoking and before we know it, our list of things we
  want to change is quite long.


  It shouldn’t be surprising, as the author shares, that for highest chance of
  success we should start with only one habit we want to change. Not the whole
  list. It seems like common sense, but in reality, many of us skip over this
  step of simplifying.


  Doing as much as possible to set yourself up for success is critical when
  breaking or making a habit. That means more than scribbling it down on a
  napkin at 11:58pm on New Year’s Eve. Jeremy Dean suggests that you make the
  time to think about your motivation, about why you want to make or break the
  habit. For some habits the motivation is obvious; health, quality of life,
  etc., but for others reasoning may not be so easily articulated. We need to
  ask ourselves what this new habit will do for us; we need a goal that we can
  ingrain so that it eventually becomes automatic. Mr. Dean explains, “what we
  find in the research is that when people’s goals start to weaken, or are weak
  in the first place, it’s very difficult to start forming a new habit. A few
  minutes spent thinking about this before you dive in will pay dividends in the
  long run.
f_conclusion: >-
  As I read _Making Habits, Breaking Habits_, it occurred to me that so much of
  what we do is habitual. From brushing our teeth in the morning, to where we
  hang our coat, to the drive or walk to work, we hardly notice these tasks or
  even remember doing them. What this says to me, after pondering many of the
  points the author makes, is that whether it is a bad habit we are trying to
  break or a new habit we are hoping to form, it can happen, it just takes more
  time than most of us expect. Where do we go from here? Well, I’m prepared to
  give it a go and tackle the nail biting once and for all.

I began reading _Making Habit, Breaking Habits_ the Tuesday after a long weekend of overindulgence at the Thanksgiving table. Think turkey, pumpkin pie, mashed potatoes, and more pumpkin pie. I didn’t need anyone to tell me to get my eating habits back in check. How fortuitous that this book, by Jeremy Dean, about habits, was my next Actionable read.

Author Jeremy Dean, a psychologist and creator of PsyBlog.com, writes his book in three parts. Part one is the ‘Anatomy of a Habit’ where he breaks down the basics and dispels some myths about habits. The second part of the book, aptly titled ‘Everyday Habits,’ describes routines in life that have become so automatic we don’t even notice them anymore. The final section gives the reader hope as we learn about ‘Habit Change’ and how to go about breaking some of those negative habits.
