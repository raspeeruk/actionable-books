  ### The Action Method


  > "While you may enjoy generating brilliant ideas and imagining new
  possibilities, you must approach every occasion of creativity with a dose of
  skepticism and a bias toward action."- Making Ideas Happen, page 31


  The Action Method is based on one simple principle: _Work and Life with a Bias
  Toward Action_.


  Any creative endeavor you take on _must be_ measured by actions.  

  Seems easy right? In fact, we probably already do this anyway, right? _Wrong_.


  Too often we find ourselves in meetings or brainstorming sessions, just
  tossing ideas back and forth. Questioning, analyzing, and sometimes even
  debating, for the _entire_ hour, without any real sense of actionable outcome
  at the end.


  Sometimes no one _even_ _knows_ what the next steps are. Or _even_ if there
  are any.


  We also tend to get caught up in new ideas we generate. Fascinated by the new
  idea, we forget about the current idea we’re working on, and before long, it’s
  been weeks, maybe months, without any progress – in other words, _no action_.


  And now, we have two “half-baked” ideas. Lovely.  

  Managing your time and energy is _crucial_ in _Making Ideas Happen_.


  And that’s why I love **The Action Method** as an approach to both
  productivity and project management.


  It puts an emphasis on the one thing that pushes ideas forward: _action_.


  So how does it work? The following two Insights encompass the foundation of
  The Action Method.

  ### Action Steps, References and Backburner Items


  > "But once you have everything classified as a project, you can start
  breaking each one down into its primary components: Action Steps, References,
  and Backburner Items."- Making Ideas Happen, page 34


  Every project has three primary components: _Action Steps, References and
  Backburner Items_.


  **Action Steps** are the _most important_ component in the project. They are
  the specific and concrete tasks that you or someone else does, to move the
  project forward. Each action step must be owned by someone and should start
  with a verb: _design_ the birthday invitations, _write_ the demo scenario
  script, _book_ the hall for the fundraiser.


  If you need to follow up with, or wait for someone to complete an action step,
  capture this in your action steps. For example, “Ensure Alex books the
  fundraiser hall” or “Awaiting confirmation from Lisa on demo date”. This
  ensures you don’t forget anything important.


  Finally, “capture action steps everywhere”. Just like ideas, action steps
  aren’t limited to come up in meetings. Whether you’re reading this article,
  engaged in a lunchroom conversation or on a phone call, capture your action
  steps.


  _“No Action Steps, no action, no results…  

  Action Steps are to be revered and treated as sacred in any project.”_


  _Making Ideas Happen_, Page 37


  **References** are _not_ actionable. They are the handouts, notes, sketches,
  meeting minutes, etc. that we _refer to_ for information. They are simply
  there for our reference.


  **Backburner Items** are ideas that are _not_ actionable yet, but may be later
  on. They’re new ideas we might come up with, but aren’t relevant to the
  project right at this time. For example, maybe you came across a new WordPress
  theme that might be useful for your blog, or maybe you thought of a new demo
  scenario that can be used in the future.


  Although they’re not actionable, you still capture these items, since you’ll
  forget them if you don’t (Trust me, I know because I have J). In fact, Scott
  recommends that you create a “Backburner Ritual”, where you make it a habit to
  periodically (i.e. monthly) revisit your Backburner Items. These can often
  lead to new ideas and projects.


  I _love_ this approach. Focusing on Action Steps, References and Backburner
  Items, simplifies the process. You’re not lost in the “different phases” of
  the project. You’re focused on three primary components, with a bias towards
  action, which _ultimately_ moves your ideas forward.


  How you actually manage these is up to you. Scott and his team have created an
  [online application](http://www.actionmethod.com) for The Action Method, but I
  just created an Excel Document with three worksheets for now: Action Steps,
  References and Backburner Items.


  In fact, I put all of my Action Steps across all projects on one list, as
  suggested by Scott. The idea is that maintaining several Action Steps lists
  just isn’t practical. You’re bound to miss items as you jump from list to
  list. So when it comes to Action Steps, I just have one list, where I
  identify: The Action, The Project, The Due Date. I’ll usually just sort the
  list by due date and project. Highlighting critical items in Red and completed
  items in Green. (Click [here](http://actionablebooks.com/?attachment_id=1588)
  to download a sample Action Steps list.)


  I was skeptical at first, but as someone who had several TODO lists before,
  this new approach has really helped my productivity across projects.


  Picking only one or two key ideas from _Making Ideas Happen_ really doesn’t do
  it justice. Aside from The Action Method, Scott shares other fantastic ideas
  to help us push our ideas forward (i.e. “Short-Circuiting the Rewards
  System”).


  Since I started following The Action Method, I’ve seen a _vast_ improvement in
  my focus on moving my ideas forward. So this is one book I am _definitely_
  keeping close by, to re-read and reference, as I continue my pursuit in
  _Making Ideas Happen_.


  To quote Ji Lee, Creative Director at Google Creative Labs, “This book is like
  a Swiss Army knife for ideas.”

  ### Everything Is A Project


  > "The Action Method begins with a simple premise: everything is a project."-
  Making Ideas Happen, page 34


  Every idea, and everything you work on, is a project.  

  Doesn’t matter if it’s personal or professional – treat each one like its
  _own_, _individual_, _project_.


  Planning a surprise birthday? That’s a project.  

  Delivering a big demo on Friday? That’s a project.  

  Starting a blog? That’s a project.


  When you treat every idea like a project, you’re assuming that these are ideas
  you want to push into action. They’re ideas you want to act on and see through
  to completion.


  And we can’t ignore the fact that our ideas are not only limited to work.
  Whether it’s a surprise birthday party, new fitness regimen or an upcoming
  fundraiser, we have ideas and events outside of work that we are working on as
  well.


  If we fail to consider these as current projects, we’ll grossly underestimate
  the available time and energy we have available to work on other projects.

Ideas.  
We all have them.  
Whether it’s a new marketing strategy, more effective fitness regimen, or a new business idea.  
We _always_ seem to have an abundance of ideas.

The _challenge_, however, is in _actually Making Ideas Happen.  
_We often forget, coming up with the idea itself, is _actually_ the easy part.  
In fact, it’s _only_ the beginning.

It’s like Thomas Edison famously said, “Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.”

Enter Scott Belsky and his (conveniently titled) book, _Making Ideas Happen: Overcoming The Obstacles Between Vision and Reality_.

As the Founder and CEO of Behance, “a company on a mission to empower and organize the creative world”, Scott has had the opportunity to study, and sit down with, some of the most productive creative teams and individuals in our world today.

From leading creative companies like IDEO and Disney, to creative leaders like author Seth Godin and Zappos CEO, Tony Hsieh, Scott has learned about the habits, principles and techniques, these companies and individuals follow, to consistently _Make Ideas Happen_.

And it’s these principles and techniques that he shares in _Making Ideas Happen_.

Principles and techniques I’m glad I’m now aware of.  
Because, I’m sure, like some of you, 6 months after thinking of that “genius” idea, it’s still sitting tucked away in my notebook – exactly where I left it.
