  ### The choices that lead to being indispensable


  > "We make an infinite number of choices each day, but there are six
  fundamental choices that will dictate our life experience."- Making Yourself
  Indispensable, pages 19-20


  The six fundamental life choices that lead to being indispensable serve as
  guides to daily living. They are choices between the following:


  **Being driven by a purpose or driven by a goal** – Have you ever encountered
  a customer service agent who truly listens to you and works hard to satisfy
  your needs? That agent is most likely driven by a purpose (e.g. “Be in service
  to others.) Have you ever encountered a customer service agent who is clearly
  reading from a script and ends your interaction by reading a canned statement
  indicating that their company values its customers? That agent is most likely
  driven by the goal to read their script with each and every customer.


  **Choosing to play big or play small** – Playing big is about choosing to
  generously share your skills, talents, and gifts in service of others.
  Conversely, playing small is about being selfish with your talents and
  abilities.


  **Being adaptable or being rigid** – In our quickly ever-changing world, being
  adaptable is critical. Being rigid and sticking with “the way we’ve always
  done things around here” will quickly make you dispensable.


  **Being WE centered or ME centered** – As Samuel points out, “unless you are a
  hermit, you are connected to others around you”. Making decisions and taking
  action in service of others and in full awareness of how it impacts those
  connected to you leads to being indispensable just as surely as consistently
  choosing to act only in service of yourself will lead to being dispensable in
  the eyes of others.


  **Being focused on priority or activity** – Of course you’re busy. We’re all
  busy. There are way too many things on your list for you to ever truly get
  everything done. So, Samuel advises that we be ever-mindful of what’s most
  important when choosing which tasks to check off our never-ending to-do list.


  **Valuing others or disregarding others** – Indispensable people acknowledge
  others’ contributions while helping others grow and develop. Dispensable
  people are threatened by the growth and success of others.

  ### The power of taking ownership


  > "While it is obvious that when we are the cause of a problem we need to fix
  it, there are many situations in which we are merely involved in a problem or
  ‘see’ the problem. We still have the ownership to surface it, contribute to
  fixing it, and support others in fixing it. This is taking full dominion over
  the problems impacting your life. This is the step of empowerment."- Making
  Yourself Indispensable, page 99


  Taking Ownership is the second phase of The Accountability Loop. It’s what you
  do if you’ve chosen to play big and become indispensable in an organization.
  While it requires courage and effort, the reward is empowerment and it’s one
  of the first steps towards making a difference.


  Samuel’s list of places we can take ownership at work is especially helpful.
  These are seven areas where I think behavior from The Victim Loop runs
  rampant. The seven areas he lists and challenges the reader to take ownership
  are the following:


  *   Ownership in meetings

  *   Ownership of surfacing and resolving issues

  *   Ownership of breaking down silos

  *   Ownership of staying focused on priorities

  *   Ownership of engagement at all organizational levels

  *   Ownership of responding to business trends

  *   Ownership of creating a safe work environment

  ### Recognize when you're on the Victim Loop


  > "The Victim Loop is a way of life in which 'stuff' happens to you. You don’t
  seem to have a choice. Since we all visit it at different times in our lives,
  the question to ask yourself is not, ‘How do I prevent myself from going
  there?’ but ‘How fast can I get out of there?’"- Making Yourself
  Indispensable, page 50


  Samuel’s roadmap to success depicts two loops (i.e. paths) that we all
  traverse and have access to: **The Accountability Loop** and **The Victim
  Loop**. Following The Accountability Loop leads to becoming indispensable.
  Following The Victim Loop leads to being dispensable to others.


  Samuel frequently acknowledges that as a human being, I am not only likely,
  but am absolutely guaranteed, to bounce back and forth between the two loops.
  He also acknowledges that I might not always realize that I’ve switched to The
  Victim Loop. And so, he devotes time to describing six phases of The Victim
  Loop so that readers will recognize when they’ve made a choice that places
  them on it.


  You know you’re on The Victim Loop when you exhibit one of the following
  behaviors:


  *   You ignore a problem or issue.

  *   You deny any responsibility.

  *   You blame a problem or situation on someone or something else.

  *   You devote energy to rationalizing my response to a situation.

  *   You resist the situation or problem (sometimes by throwing a tantrum.)

  *   You hide from the situation or problem.


  Once you realize that you’re on The Victim Loop, Samuel recommends that you
  leap onto whichever phase of The Accountability Loop that makes the most sense
  given the details of your situation. There are six phases on The
  Accountability Loop, and the one that resonated most with me involves taking
  ownership.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Making Yourself Indispensable_ delivers on Samuel’s promise of providing a
  roadmap for success. While none of what appears in the book surprised me, or
  struck me as especially new, Samuel managed to keep my attention. In fact,
  throughout the day I find myself asking if I’m being driven by a purpose or a
  goal, choosing to play big or small, being adaptable or rigid, being WE
  centered or ME centered, being focused on priority or activity, and valuing or
  disregarding others. And, as a result, I find myself taking ownership of more
  and more.

How would you like to be certain that you are so valuable to your company, boss, and coworkers that even if jobs are being eliminated around you, you are too valuable to let go? _Making Yourself Indispensible_ by Mark Samuel, one of the most actionable books I’ve read in a long time, promises just that. In it, Samuel lays out a step-by-step process to becoming indispensible at work, at home, and in your community.

**Becoming indispensable, Samuel explains, requires that you consistently exhibit the following ten behaviors:**

1\. Be in service to others without expecting anything in return.  
2\. Be dedicated to the highest standards of performance, teamwork, and communication.  
3\. Be open and adaptable.  
4\. Keep commitments and agreements.  
5\. Expand your role to support your organization, community, or family.  
6\. Be a valued resource to others.  
7\. Be dedicated to self-improvement and professional development.  
8\. Use obstacles and challenges as opportunities for improvement.  
9\. Engage and include others when making decisions or changes.  
10\. Acknowledge and value the contributions of others.

Of utmost importance to becoming indispensable, however, is commitment to exhibiting these behaviors and then holding yourself accountable to that commitment (thus the subtitle of the book, “The Power of Personal Accountability.”)

**Holding oneself accountable, according to Samuel, is a matter of making the right choices throughout the day, every day.** He offers guidance for those who wish to become indispensable in the form of six fundamental life choices.
