  ### Perspective first. Change second.


  > "I've never seen a team sport without a huddle, yet we'll continue working
  for months – if not years – with clients and colleagues without ever taking a
  step back, taking stock and making improvements to our systems."- Manage Your
  Day-To-Day, page 17


  When was the last time you actually paused to think about your schedule, what
  you accomplish and your overall satisfaction with it all? I know… I had a hard
  time recalling this, too. But that is the point that the 99U team wants to
  bring to light for readers. To be effective in your work, you must realize how
  you are currently working and whether or not that is serving you.


  In creative vocations there is always a need to uninterrupted “creation time,”
  and to an extent this is true for all industries. Everyone is a creator of
  some kind. **Yet, producing our best work is all too frequently hindered by
  things like email, meetings, lack of a routine and other distractions.**


  Step one to corralling the chaos is to understand what you really need in
  order to be creative and work effectively, then developing a schedule that
  respects your needs. For instance, if you are a writer it’s likely that you’ll
  need time to actually write and work on personal or client projects. It would
  be ideal to proactively schedule your time for writing in advance so that it
  is just inherently built into your schedule. This might at the same time every
  day or certain times each week.

  ### Technology could be the common enemy


  > "Amid this constant surge of information, attention has become our most
  precious asset."- Manage Your Day-To-Day, page 69


  The better part of _Manage Your Day-To-Day_ is spent examining our
  relationship with technology. It’s undeniable that it has many benefits for
  our work, yet our own nature seems to work against us in these instances. Some
  suggest that it is the result of habit formation. Others suggest it is our
  lack of self-discipline. Cal Newport says it is because “we lack clear metrics
  around these behaviors’ costs”. In other words, **we don’t really understand
  the implications of our choice to leave email and social media notifications
  on all the time.**


  There are many suggestions in the book for managing this sometimes beastly
  relationship with technology. Some highlights include:


  *   Utilizing your “Out of Office” responder all the time. Let people know
  when you are checking email so they know when to expect a response and ask
  them to call you if it’s urgent. This effectively relieves the task of
  constantly checking email.


  *   Institute technology-free sabbaticals. Maybe it’s once a week or once a
  month. Either way, there are plenty of benefits to being “unplugged,”
  including the feeling of a fresh start when you return to work.


  *   Go back to basics and learn to trust your instincts and creativity rather
  than relying on technology.

  ### Create a routine


  > "Truly great creative achievements require hundreds, if not thousands, of
  hours of work, and we have to make time every single day to put in those
  hours. Routines help us do this by setting expectations about availability,
  aligning our workflow with our energy levels, and getting our minds into a
  regular rhythm of creating."- Manage Your Day-To-Day, page 23


  Long gone are the days as children when we went from one scheduled environment
  to another. In primary school, teachers would neatly outline the day’s
  schedule on the whiteboard and when you weren’t in school, chances are that
  your mom probably had a calendar that scheduled your “free time.” **But
  somewhere along the line as adults we are given complete control over our time
  and rather than embrace the control, we surrender to chaos and urgent
  demands.** Technology is part of the issue as it has shaped our culture to be
  one of instant gratification and response.


  But the truth is that you have to **step up to the plate and be the commander
  of your schedule.** Your time is precious and the way that you treat it
  reinforces how you want others to treat it. There are a few ways to do this.
  Start by simply blocking off “creation time” in your calendar. Make these
  distraction-free times, where you turn off the internet connection and turn
  off your phone. As Gretchen Rubin writes, “Over the long run, the unglamorous
  habit of frequency fosters both productivity and creativity”.


  This does not mean that you have to toil away at your desk for 12
  uninterrupted hours at a time. In fact, there are benefits of switching
  between mindful and mindless work. “Shifting from mindful to mindless work
  gives the brain time to process complex problems in a relaxed state and also
  restores the energy necessary for the next round of mindful work,” writes Erin
  Rooney Doland. It’s all about finding what works for you and it’s okay to be a
  little selfish in this process.
f_conclusion: >-
  There’s a strong argument to be made that the strategies and tips in this book
  are not just applicable to creatives. They tap into larger problems in our
  working culture. Perhaps Henry David Thoreau said it best: **“It is not enough
  to be busy, (the ants are busy) we must ask: ‘What are we busy about?’”**

**We are tapped out mentally, physically and emotionally,** and yet we continue to operate over capacity. I think most people would agree with this statement, regardless of what line of work you are in or what walk of life you might come from. While modern life has eminent convenience and ease from technological advances, **actually _getting work done_ seems to be increasingly more difficult.** This is especially true if your occupation requires you to be creative.

The brilliant minds at 99U recognized this problem several years ago and have been diligently working towards solutions and curriculum to fill the gap. In their most recent publication, _Manage Your Day-To-Day: Build Your Routine, Find Your Focus and Sharpen Your Creative Mind_, they have brought together thought leaders from a variety of backgrounds to consider the issue of making space for creativity in the midst of a world that is filled with urgent demands that vie for our attention. The result is a “playbook of best practices for producing great work”. While the insights from people like Steven Pressfield, Dan Ariely, Gretchen Rubin and Seth Godin are interesting, the most valuable aspect of this book is that it forces you to **take a step back and question your working habits in order to create more effective ones.**
