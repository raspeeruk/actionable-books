  ### Same as it ever was


  > "The delivery mechanisms change; the basic marketing concepts behind them
  don’t."- Marketing Above the Noise, page 48


  Much of the first portion of the book is dedicated to providing in-depth
  details about each of eight dynamic market leverage factors, or “timeless
  marketing truths,” that should guide every marketing effort. If these factors
  seem basic, it’s because they are. No matter the specific tools and tactics
  you use to activate your marketing efforts, these eight factors need to be
  acknowledged, understood and carefully considered for a campaign to succeed:


  *   **Products** – At the base of every marketing effort is the actual thing
  being marketed. Whether it is a physical product, a service or a point of
  view. Take a critical look at your product to ensure that it’s up to snuff.

  *   **Customers** – Even the best product in the world is only as useful as
  its customer deems it to be, so your customers’ desires, needs, habits,
  lifestyle, challenges, questions and concerns should be a key consideration in
  any marketing efforts.

  *   **Market** – A sound knowledge of the market for your product is essential
  to establishing and maintaining (or changing) your place in it.

  *   **Brand** – Your reputation can help you or hurt you, and it exists
  whether you choose to manage it or not. Develop a brand promise based on your
  company values and mission, and be sure that you keep the promises you’re
  making to keep your brand intact.

  *   **Sales** – Ensure that the individuals representing your brand in the
  marketplace have been provided with the knowledge and resources to properly
  represent that brand out in the market, and engage with them early and often
  to make the most of their experiences in that market.

  *   **Communication** – Companies need to know how to effectively communicate
  the value they provide. There are a lot of ways to do this, and there may not
  be one “right” way, but communication is key.

  *   **Operation** – Growth isn’t possible without reflection, and reflection
  isn’t possible without details to reflect on. Establish means of delivering,
  tracking and analyzing your marketing activities so you can improve.

  *   **Strategy** – All of these elements should inform your strategy, not only
  for your marketing but for your business as a whole.


  These factors should be viewed as essential and interdependent, and it’s
  important to recognize their influence on one another when developing a
  marketing strategy. Consider the value your sales staff could bring to a
  product conversation with their intimate knowledge of your customer base.
  Customer feedback and perception becomes a part of your brand, and can
  influence the way you create products, sell those products, and communicate
  your message. Understanding the interplay of these eight factors and letting
  that interplay inform your strategy is the key to marketing successfully,
  digitally or otherwise.

  ### Singing the Same Song


  > "So sales thinks marketing just wants them to execute against a marketing
  plan that marketing insists sales should follow. While marketing thinks sales
  just wants them to execute against a set of deliverables that sales has
  demanded from marketing. See the patent here?"- Marketing Above the Noise,
  page 105


  A common struggle, especially in large organizations, is what Popky calls a
  “sibling rivalry” between sales and marketing. Because both the sales staff
  and the marketing staff will be evaluated based on the results that come from
  shared decisions, each feels compelled to assert their take on the issue at
  hand, which can result in tensions. To ensure the best possible outcome, both
  teams needs to share their value and also feel valued, so Popky advises an
  “exchange system” to promote optimal collaboration.


  By allowing marketing folks to sit in on sales meetings or calls, they can
  gain perspective on the client-facing experience and come back with a new
  understanding of what customers want. When sales folks embed with the
  marketing team, they can better appreciate the various factors that go into
  creating marketing initiatives. In both instances, the “host” department will
  feel valued and appreciated for being recognized as a vital part of the
  process.

  ### The Customer Conversation


  > "The era when marketers could talk at customers has long passed."- Marketing
  Above the Noise, page 44


  Web commenting, email and social media have made it so that customers are
  finally getting to respond to messages that marketers are putting out. And
  online conversations have many of the same dynamics as in-person
  conversations, including the desire for a speaker to feel heard. Popky lays
  out an easy three-step process to help marketers keep up their end of the
  conversational promise:


  1.  “**Acknowledge** that the feedback has been received.”

  2.  “**Accept** that there is valuable input and information in the feedback
  (whether you agree with the input or not).”

  3.  **“Articulate** your next steps now that you’ve received this input (and
  share it with others in the organization, research the issues more deeply,
  make changes to a process or procedure, etc.)”

  At the close of the book, Popky tells readers not to worry if their marketing
  efforts aren’t quite up to snuff just yet: In 2013, a Marketing2020 study
  showed that most organizations have _not_ yet been able to pull off all of the
  key things mentioned in the book. But awareness and mindfulness is key to
  getting there, so Popky invites readers to take the online assessment to
  evaluate your organization’s status on the eight Dynamic Market Leverage
  Factors.

> "It’s time to move the discussion away from today’s latest hot marketing tools and tactics to what really counts: convincing customers to trust you with their business—not just once, but time and time again." _\- Marketing Above the Noise, page xviii_

Living in a digital world has created the expectation of immediate response. While it might be tempting to rely on new tools and “real time” tactics, _Marketing Above The Noise_ offers a refreshing reality check about what really drives successful initiatives. Author Linda J. Popky gives in-depth explanation of the timeless and tool-agnostic driving forces of marketing and provides actionable tips and case studies that show how being mindful of these factors (or ignoring them) can dramatically alter the results of your marketing efforts.
