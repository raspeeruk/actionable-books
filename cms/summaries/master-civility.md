  ### The Destructive Power of Incivility—and the Antidote


  > "In a study of 4,500 doctors and nurses, 71 percent tied disruptive behavior
  (defined as ‘abusive personal conduct,’ including condescending, insulting, or
  rude behavior) to medical errors they knew of and 27 percent tied bad behavior
  to the deaths of their patients."- Mastering Civility, location 318


  Got your attention? This statistic, one of many results of studies that Dr.
  Porath conducted, certainly got mine. Here’s more:


  *   Fortune 1000 firms spend 13 percent of their time at work—the equivalent
  of seven weeks a year—mending employee relationships and dealing with the
  aftermath of incivility.

  *   Only 20 percent of consumers who had witnessed employees treating each
  other with incivility said they would continue to use the firm’s products.

  *   The mere exposure to rudeness disrupts our ability to pay attention and
  reduces performance.

  *   Once people are exposed to rudeness, they are three times less likely to
  help others and their willingness to share drops by more than half.


  The bottom line? Incivility is deeply disruptive—it drains our cognitive
  resources and influences our capacity for civility.


  So, what can we do? We can consciously behave in ways that promote civility.
  We can foster civility in the organizations we lead (whether we are formal or
  informal leaders). And, civility can “overwrite” incivility. When we
  consciously act with civility or expose ourselves to civility when faced with
  incivility, we release ourselves and others from incivility’s grip.


  Porath’s manifesto is filled with ways that leaders can create civility. They
  are, for the most part, elements of mindful, conscious leadership—the
  essential antidote to incivility. Conscious leadership in an environment where
  incivility is tolerated is not so easy. Porath makes the case that it’s worth
  the effort both because it’s the right thing to do and because it’s good for
  business.

  ### Know Thyself


  > "Incivility usually arises not from malice but from ignorance. I started my
  research thinking that jerks out there were intentionally ruining workplaces;
  I now see that most bad behavior reflects a lack of self­-awareness. "-
  Mastering Civility, location 176


  One of the most important findings around incivility is that it is often more
  situational than personality-driven. This suggests both that most people are
  capable of greater civility—and that incivility is not limited to people who
  are “jerks.”


  What this also means is that, especially when we are under stress, we may
  unknowingly act in ways that might be perceived as lacking civility. We also
  might not even be aware that some of our behaviors might be interpreted by
  others as lacking civility. (How often do you respond to e-mail when you’re in
  a meeting? Text in the middle of a conversation? Interrupt? Forget to say
  thank-you?) Given that 98% of people polled by Porath say that they have
  experienced incivility, and over 60% say it’s a weekly occurrence (a radical
  increase from the late nineties when the figure was 25%,) it seems that more
  people are behaving in ways that lack civility more frequently.


  Becoming aware of one’s own behaviors and impact on others, and at the core,
  managing stressors more effectively, is key to reducing incivility. As
  leaders, this also suggests that creating workplaces that acknowledge and
  manage stressors more effectively is also critical.


  Porath provides an [assessment
  tool](http://www.christineporath.com/assess-yourself/) that allows us to rate
  ourselves against an extensive list of behaviors. I strongly recommend
  completing the assessment. It was humbling for me to answer the questions and
  realize that my sense of myself as consistently demonstrating civility might
  be inaccurate. The results are organized against different categories of
  behavior—which helped me to see how others might be experiencing me. I also
  appreciated the suggestions for ways to address civility deficits.

  ### Civility Can Be Simple: The Low-hanging Fruit


  > "In the workplace, civil behaviors can be extraordinarily small. A colleague
  can smile and say hello to you in the hallway, an associate can ask an
  assistant to please do a task and thank her after she completes it. Leaders
  can behave civilly by engaging others in conversation rather than ordering
  them around, or by taking time to applaud subordinates when they do a good
  job."- Mastering Civility, location 388


  In addition to tackling more strategic and systemic actions that leaders can
  take to create or restore civility (e.g., hiring, coaching and measurement
  practices,) Porath spends a chapter on “fundamentals.” These are “the small
  behaviors that we frequently overlook that allow us to connect by being more
  attentive.” Each of these is something we can do by behaving just a bit
  differently in any given moment.


  Here’s each of those three behaviors—with a bit of context.


  *   **Smiling:** While we know how a smile feels, I still found the research
  surprisingly powerful. Smiling is a mood booster—for the smiler and the person
  who is the recipient. It’s contagious, too. And, since it’s hard to fake a
  smile, if you want to smile more, do it from the “inside-out.” Think of
  something that genuinely makes you happy and allows you to smile.

  *   **Building relationships with subordinates:** Acknowledge, connect with,
  relate to the people who report to you. While this sounds obvious—in reality,
  it often is missing. How do you start your day? What rituals do you have
  through which you connect with your team? Do you take the time with your team
  members? How do you override distance when you have a virtual team?

  *   **Listening:** “At its core,” writes Porath, “civility is about connecting
  in human ways with others.” Perhaps the most powerful way to connect is
  through attentive, thoughtful, and full listening.


  Whether you are responding to incivility or actively creating a culture
  grounded in civility, don’t forget these fundamentals.

  Understanding the destructive power of incivility has had the effect of making
  me more conscious of the urgency of this issue. It also made me aware of the
  need to speak up when confronted with incivility and make a commitment to
  ensuring that the spaces that I inhabit—at home and at work—pay greater
  attention to civility.

  "Incivility sucks something out of all of us. It takes us on an emotional
  roller­coaster ride. It siphons cognitive resources. It even eats away at
  physical health. Ultimately, we become a fraction of ourselves. We don’t show
  up to the same extent. If you’re experiencing incivility, don’t brush it off."

As I was finishing Christine Porath’s book, _Mastering Civility_, Travis Kalanick was forced to resign as CEO of Uber. Ultimately, despite his astounding successes in upending an industry and building a powerful company, his incivility and his role in creating a culture of incivility resulted in his demise.

I find the story of Kalanicks’ rise and fall simultaneously troubling and encouraging. Troubling that his behavior was tolerated for so long; encouraged that, ultimately, it was not. Incivility, over time, became intolerable and Uber’s culture eroded its performance. Christine Porath, I’m sure, was unsurprised. Her research suggests that this was predictable.

Porath’s newest book helps us to better understand why incivility matters, and how we can work to create greater civility. Her work, like the story of Uber, is both troubling and optimistic.
