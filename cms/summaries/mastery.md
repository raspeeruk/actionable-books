  ### Learning How to Learn


  > "The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in
  creative ways."- Mastery, page 64


  At no point in our history have we had such easy, affordable, and consistent
  access to the information and technology we need to study, experiment, build,
  and create. **The masters of tomorrow will be those who can exploit and take
  advantage of this access.**


  _Mastery_ is filled with countless stories, biographical accounts, and lessons
  that make one thing clear: **Masters from every era, every profession, and
  every creative field had one thing in common – they mastered learning.** More
  than pure knowledge, facts, and figures, they had learned how to identify the
  right environments, found the right mentors to support their journey, and
  learned to push beyond their comfort zone.


  The key step in becoming a master is a commitment to learning at a deep level.
  Greene uses the stories of people like Mozart, Benjamin Franklin, and Paul
  Graham, founder of Y-Combinator, to describe just how important deep knowledge
  is.


  Ericsson called it deliberate practice, Gladwell said it takes 10,000 hours,
  and Greene calls it an Apprenticeship. Regardless of the name, there is no
  such thing as an “overnight success.” True mastery requires focus,
  determination, and grit. It requires the ability to identify the right
  teachers, productive environments, and the willingness to take on the next
  challenge, the one just out of our comfort zone. The one most people shy away
  from.


  This journey toward mastery is comprised of three distinct phases:


  *   **_Apprenticeship_** – Practical, hands-on experience, separate from
  formal education and focused on skill development and evolving into an
  independent thinker.

  *   **_Creative Active_** – Using your new skills and experience, you begin to
  experiment and create.

  *   **_Mastery_** _–_ After years of practice and focus, your knowledge is so
  deep that your work has a clarity very different from anything you have
  previously experienced.


  Greene makes it crystal clear when he says, “You must value learning above
  everything else.”

  ### Engage and Embrace Your Creative Mind


  > "Creativity is by its nature an act of boldness and rebellion. You are not
  accepting the status quo or conventional wisdom. You are playing with the very
  rules you have learned, experimenting and testing the boundaries."- Mastery,
  page 203


  With so much being written about creativity and innovation today, companies
  large and small are constantly looking for ways to stand out and differentiate
  themselves. The same goes for individuals. The need for creativity – “the
  ability to expand \[your\] vision beyond conventional boundaries” – is
  becoming increasingly important in today’s ultra-competitive market.


  **Today’s “connection economy” makes it easier than ever to create something
  new** – a blog post, a photograph, a start-up – and put it into the world.
  With access to nearly instant feedback, you can make changes, adapt and tailor
  your work to the needs of your audience almost in real time.


  But this is often easier said then done. By its very nature, being creative
  means taking risks, exposing yourself to judgment, or worse, potential
  failure. The very things we as humans are conditioned to avoid. True mastery
  requires the willingness to break free from this fear, or as Greene states,
  “You must become aware of the typical patterns your mind falls into and how
  you can break out of these patterns and alter your perspective through
  conscious effort.”


  To get into a creative mode, Greene offers three suggestions:


  *   Choose the proper **_Creative Task_** _–_ choose activities where you can
  leverage your greatest skills and knowledge. It’s important you also have
  passion for this task.

  *   Use **_Creative Strategies_** to open your mind and expand your idea of
  what’s possible. As an example, he recommends continually “altering your
  perspective” as a way to prevent your current paradigms from limiting your
  ability to generate new ideas.

  *   Fostering a mindset and attitude to allow for **_Breakthroughs and
  Insights_**_._ In other words, resist the common tendencies that stifle our
  creative momentum: complacency, inflexibility, and impatience being just a few
  examples.

  ### Choose Your Environment Wisely


  > "You must choose places of work and positions that offer the greatest
  possibilities for learning. Practical knowledge is the ultimate commodity, and
  is what will pay you dividends for decades to come."- Mastery, page 55


  To become a master, you must not merely commit to acquiring knowledge. You
  must also find opportunities that offer the acquisition of practical skills.
  **Find roles where you can experiment, test, and where you’ll be surrounded by
  people that inspire you.** Search for organizations that value innovation,
  divergent thinking, and creativity. Keep in mind that while these positions
  may not always be the most glamorous or provide the largest paycheck, they are
  often the greatest opportunity for learning. You cannot be, as Greene states,
  “seduced into fields because you see others making a living, treading the
  familiar path.” **Be bold. Be brave.**


  **If mastery is your goal, resist the temptation to chase money, fame, or
  prestige.** While they undoubtedly offer their own benefits, they won’t
  necessarily lead to mastery. You have to carefully guide your career, making
  deliberate choices about how and where to focus your time and energy. **You
  have to be your own career architect.** _Mastery_ uses countless examples from
  the lives of people like Da Vinci and Goethe, who had a knack for knowing when
  they had outgrown a role or position. This very ability to identify and take
  the next step played a significant role in their development, and is essential
  to yours.


  To further accelerate the learning phase, find a mentor. As Greene states,
  “mentors do not give you a shortcut, but they streamline the process.” But
  choose this person carefully. Your mentor should come from the field you are
  pursuing. And even though today’s technology makes it possible to connect with
  virtually anyone, try to find someone where personal interaction will be
  possible. Look for someone who will challenge you, push you further than you
  would go on your own, and tailor their advice to your circumstances.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s hard to believe that we all have the natural ability to rise to the
  intellectual or creative levels of Mozart, Einstein, or Da Vinci. But for most
  of us, that’s not how we should measure our Mastery. Instead, Greene’s book
  should serve as a guide of best practices available to all of us. Each of us
  has the ability to leverage the principles and strategies used by such
  visionaries. **Which begs the question, how much better could you be?**

Is it possible that the key to what separates the Einsteins, the Mozarts, and the Da Vincis from the rest of us has less to do with intelligence and more to do with their habits, mentors, creativity, and commitment?

That’s what Robert Greene suggests in his latest work, _Mastery._ In studying the path taken by such masters, **Greene outlines several ways we can tap into a higher level of performance, a greater sense of satisfaction, and use our work to contribute on a much larger scale.**

Whether it’s a hobby or profession, mastering anything is no small task, requiring years and years of learning, experimentation, focus, and flexibility. And while reaching the highest levels may not be attainable (or even desirable) for everyone, anyone can use the advice and guidelines in this book to boost their performance.
