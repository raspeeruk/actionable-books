  ### Embrace ‘BETA’ Mode


  > "Keeping yourself in ‘permanent beta’ makes you acknowledge that you have
  bugs, that there’s more testing to do on yourself, and that you will continue
  to adapt and evolve."- Maximize Your Potential, page 38


  As a self-described ‘lifelong learner’, I like to think I’m doing fairly well
  living in permanent BETA mode. I constantly seek out books, videos, courses,
  blogs and other tools to quench my thirst for knowledge and hone my skillset.
  I readily acknowledge that I am a ‘work-in-progress’ and always will be.


  Where I often fall short with the BETA mindset is in my business. My
  perfectionist/attention-to-detail tendencies frequently override my common
  sense and I spend inordinate amounts of time ‘sweating the small stuff’
  despite Richard Carlson’s sage advice not to! I attribute this to a desire to
  minimize failure, protect my credibility and presumably only take calculated
  risks. I’ve read enough business books to know intellectually that this is not
  as helpful as I believe. Now if only I could commit to following through
  behaviourally!


  On further reflection, it occurs to me that I have begun to adopt a BETA
  philosophy at work. My website wasn’t perfect when I launched it (still isn’t)
  however it is good enough. My workshops contain great content and are
  well-received by participants even though I constantly identify things that
  could be tweaked. I’ve joined a number of online communities yet haven’t
  delineated an overall social media strategy nor developed a content calendar.
  Hmmmm! Embracing permanent BETA mode at work is not as reckless as I once
  imagined. Your turn. How are you embracing BETA mode?

  ### Automate for Success


  > "By changing your habits, you reprogram the behaviours that control most of
  your life and ultimately determine your success."- Maximize Your Potential,
  page 110


  Once you are comfortable being in permanent BETA mode and have the answers to
  your most critical questions, the next commitment you need to make is to
  periodically reboot your system and invest in automation. This is where Scott
  Young’s essay, _Reprogramming Your Daily Habits_ hit home for me. Young didn’t
  really tell me anything I didn’t know already as much as package it in a way
  that made the proverbial light bulb in my brain click on.


  Young asserts that many of our so-called daily ‘choices’ are really not
  choices but automatic or subconscious behaviours and habits. Harnessing the
  power of habits to create sustainable success reduces our need to rely solely
  on mental will-power and frees up our energy for other important tasks and
  decisions.


  Following two key principles will increase our effectiveness in the quest to
  establish positive habits – **focus** and **consistency**. Young describes
  focus as working on one habit at a time while consistency means doing the
  desired new behaviour regularly at the same time and in the same way. He
  recommends selecting one habit to focus on each month (which gives you the
  potential to adopt 12 success enhancing habits each year) and being deliberate
  about execution to help ‘automate’ the behaviour.


  I’ve always liked the idea of journaling and have started one numerous times
  only to eventually revert back to my non-journaling ways. I used to chalk this
  up to a lack of motivation and a busy lifestyle. I now see that I was
  haphazard with my execution and did not create the necessary focus and routine
  to automate the habit.


  So, I took Scott’s advice and this month established a Monday evening journal
  time. I use Box of Crayon’s Great Work Provocation questions to focus my
  writing (the Provocation conveniently arrives in my inbox Monday mornings) as
  well as questions posed by other bloggers I follow. I reflect and write Monday
  evenings when I’m enjoying my tea (a long-standing habit that I rarely miss)
  after my post-dinner walk with my husband. It’s still early days, however I am
  feeling more confident about my success rate this time around.


  I’m also excited about the impact that establishing 12 success-oriented habits
  in one year can have on my life. While I’ve heard the idea before, it somehow
  seemed daunting and unrealistic. As with my journaling, I had good intentions
  and lackluster follow-through. Young’s simple formula for execution and
  automation makes it seem far more attainable now and I have started to
  generate a list of ideas for other habits I’d like to adopt. Next month I’ll
  probably focus exclusively on re-introducing a weights workout to complement
  my cardio training and the month after that…who knows?!

  ### Play Twenty Questions


  > "Always be asking ‘What’s next?’ If you’re not asking questions, you’re not
  going to find answers."- Maximize Your Potential, page 58


  Actually, as a professional facilitator, I’m pretty good at asking others
  thought provoking questions and encouraging people to go beyond their initial
  response – to dig deeper. The reason I chose this as a noteworthy insight was
  the realization that I don’t always take the time to fully answer the
  multitude of questions that would lead to deeper insights and help me make
  more effective, sustainable decisions.


  Do I want to grow my expertise and build an incredible career? (_I picked this
  book up so I must want to do something differently!_) In what areas? Why? What
  opportunities are available? Do I have the time, energy and resources to
  pursue those opportunities? What would I consider to be a ‘bold risk’? What’s
  preventing me from being bold and taking those larger leaps of faith?


  These are all great questions in need of answering. Which then led to my
  decision to dedicate more time to asking and answering questions and my second
  noteworthy GEM.
f_conclusion: >-
  What about you? What new habits will help you maximize your potential? What
  existing (bad) habits need to be eliminated and replaced with more positive
  behaviours? Pick one and think about how, where and when you can consistently
  focus on executing that behaviour. Then commit to doing it for the next four
  weeks so it becomes a natural part of your day (or week).

  hone your skills, to take bold risks, and to put your ego on the line in
  pursuit of something greater."

> "Your ability to realize your potential will depend upon your willingness to hone your skills, to take bold risks, and to put your ego on the line in pursuit of something greater." _\- Maximize Your Potential, page 18_

_Maximize Your Potential_, a compilation of 21 essays edited by Jocelyn Glei, is a hefty treasure chest filled with dozens of glittering golden eggs and actionable Insights, and is an absolute delight to read. The book is a collection of insights and lessons on how to “develop your talents and craft an incredible career” and does not disappoint!

Glei has organized the short essays around four areas deemed essential to long-term career success:

*   Identifying and creating new opportunities
*   Developing expertise over time
*   Cultivating collaborative relationships
*   Learning to take risks

Each section ends with a ‘Key Takeaways’ summary which is truly inspirational and action-oriented. I’ve picked three of my favourites to showcase here and you will find dozens more should you decide to read the book.
