  ### Vocations Provide Meaning and Purpose


  > "There’s a global movement under way in which all manner of workers are
  seeking meaning and dignity in their work."- Meaningful Work, page 26


  Those companies, brands and individuals who embrace the global movement and
  shift their mind-set to purpose-driven work will be the ones to not just
  survive but to thrive in the future. Think about it. Having a business
  vocation isn’t some idealistic notion; it is a direct response to the changing
  tides of capitalism as we know it. People are seeking a sense of belonging and
  meaning more than ever before. If you want to attract and retain the best
  people, you better figure this out fast.


  Your company’s vocation, he says, is significantly more powerful than your
  mission statement. It provides meaning and purpose. Products and services
  created with intention, by people who feel they’re contributing toward a
  higher purpose, will undoubtedly be higher quality. Businesses become great
  when they are driven by a vocation that gives their product, service and
  employees purpose.


  I work in the pharmaceutical industry helping teams connect with their purpose
  or vocation – to contribute to better patient outcomes. This is the calling
  that inspires, engages and reminds people why they do what they do. Driven by
  this mindset, they make better decisions that lead to greater outcomes. For
  pharma people, we see much greater success when we create engagement through
  our common purpose to help improve patient outcomes.

  ### Ideas are great. Action is better!


  > "In order for the vocation to be truly transformational, it must be woven
  into the fabric of your organizational culture, with a priority on action."-
  Meaningful Work, page 43


  Having the idea of identifying the vocation is great but not enough. For
  example, most pharma companies now tell the world they are patient focused. I
  saw that: you rolled your eyes. And that is the point. _Saying_ is not nearly
  as good as _being_. The vocation can’t just be a window dressing for the
  company. It isn’t effective as a change agent if it isn’t integrated into the
  business. It must trickle down from the top and bubble up from the bottom.


  Pharma leaders often ask me, what do we need to tell our people to do to be
  patient focused? They are asking the wrong question. When people are inspired
  with their purpose, they will develop more and better ideas than you could
  ever tell them. The question should be “how do we empower our people with
  their sense of purpose?”. This leads to the best part! It is then that they
  will actively contribute to the business vocation by proposing their own
  ideas! It is then that they will seek out opportunities to put their vocation
  into practice every day.


  How will you know when it’s working? Askinosie says it’s not a business
  vocation if it’s not making waves in the organization. It is a living organism
  that is continually open to growth. He says it’s not about striking an exact
  equal balance between business and vocation, but about finding harmony between
  the two, even when they are asymmetrical.

  ### The Harmony of Profit and Purpose


  > "If we pull our ‘business’ apart from our vocation, then it ceases to be
  great."- Meaningful Work, page 64


  Does your company have a ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ department? Most
  large companies do. While this is a step in the right direction, it may
  represent an opportunity unfulfilled. Typically, this team operates
  independently from the other departments. There is an assumption that profits
  and shareholder value are sacrificed by their efforts. Askinosie says his aim
  is to transcend the limiting belief prevalent in traditional business that
  “doing good” is an expense line.


  At his company, they think differently. For them, doing good and doing well
  drive each other and are inseparable! They integrate the notions of their
  vocation into every department and decision in the company. Perhaps job titles
  change, or duties are adjusted because priorities have shifted. Or you may
  start rewarding people differently.


  I have found that in pharma, those brands driven by their vocation to serve
  patients, see the best outcomes. I firmly believe that pharma companies who
  help each person in their organization identify and communicate their purpose
  or vocation, will be the ones who will be most successful.
f_conclusion: >-
  Whether you call it vocation, purpose, meaning, culture, environment or
  mind-set, it begins with how you make your people feel about the work they do.
  We must stop pretending that our hearts are not a part of business. And
  acknowledge that feeling connected to the reason you do what you do is
  integral to your success.

It’s been estimated that you will spend approximately eighty thousand hours of your lifetime at work. That’s a lot of time. Do you love it? Do you feel fulfilled by it? Or, like it is for so many, is work more of an energy drain than an energy boost?

Shawn Askinosie was exhausted after working two decades as a criminal defence lawyer. In search of change, he volunteered at the palliative care wing of a hospital and went on retreats at a Trappist monastery. By focusing on others instead of himself, realizing that _being_ is just as necessary as _doing,_ and seeking to open his heart, he eventually uncovered his passion.

He founded Askinosie Chocolate where he practices direct trade, and profit shares with farmers in Tanzania, Ecuador, and the Philippines. His company also partners with schools in those communities to provide lunch to 2,600 children every day. Their business model has been featured in the _New York Times,_ the _Wall Street Journal,_ and on Bloomberg. Shawn was named by _O, The Oprah Winfrey Magazine,_ as one of “15 Guys Who are Saving the World”.

In _Meaningful Work_, Askinosie shows us how we can all find meaning in our work, and be a force for good in the world. At the end of each chapter are exercises and tools to help you. His hope is that whether you are beginning a new venture or want to infuse your current one with dedicated purpose, you will experience the deep lessons he’s learned and that they will help you find your next step to meaningful work.

If you are someone who wants to live your best life and create the best business results possible, identifying your purpose or vocation – the reason you do what you do – just may be your essential next move. Seeking your vocation is how you will wake up, see more clearly, experience more joy and uncover your true self.
