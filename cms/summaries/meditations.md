  ### Exercise control of your perceptions


  > "Choose not to be harmed – and you won’t feel harmed. Don’t feel harmed -
  and you haven’t been."- Meditations, page 39


  According to Stoic philosophy, it is not the objects or events in our lives
  that are the problem; rather, it is our perception of the events that cause
  the issues. When the objects and events around us reach our faculty of
  perception, they can be misinterpreted by our mind based on our previous
  experiences or biases. _Meditations_ is a book largely focused on Marcus
  Aurelius’s attempts to exercise stringent control over his faculty of
  perception. In his first entry in Book Two, he openly admits that, “The people
  I deal with today will be meddling, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly.”
  But he also asserts that “I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of
  evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own –
  not of the same blood or birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of
  the divine.” He shifts his perception by explaining to himself that we are all
  human, having been born into the world the same way, and to feel anger towards
  another person is in itself unnatural.


  Early in my career, I was passed over for a promotion. At that time, the event
  felt like a disaster to me. I was disappointed in myself, in my manager, and
  in the company that I worked for. Sadly, I never regained my footing in the
  organization again and left a few years later. What if I had looked at that
  situation differently? What if I didn’t take it so personally and looked at it
  as an opportunity to improve or as a fresh start? Being able to detach oneself
  from the objects and events around us can turn a challenge into an
  opportunity. It’s not easy but we owe it to ourselves to exercise stringent
  control over our perception.

  ### Take personal responsibility


  > "If they’ve made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they
  went wrong. If you can’t do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one."-
  Meditations, page 132


  As the Emperor of the largest empire in the world, Marcus Aurelius must have
  dealt with a variety of people from the noblest to the most unscrupulous. A
  persistent motif in _Meditations_ is Aurelius’s struggle with restraining
  frustration and anger with incompetent or dishonest people in his life.
  However, at no point in the book does he blame others for wrong doing.
  Instead, when faced with someone’s bad behaviour, he asks himself when he
  might’ve acted like that or if he should have trusted that person in the first
  place. Either perspective puts the responsibility squarely on his shoulders.


  Although the Stoics believed in an all-pervading force called the _logos_,
  judging from Aurelius’s writings they still firmly believed in the importance
  of controlling what one can control. Once you take care of your own actions
  then you can be open to whatever may happen from there.

  ### Keep your mind clear


  > "People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear.
  In not turning away from people or the things that happen to them. In
  accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each thing as it
  deserves."- Meditations, page 110


  In order control our perceptions, we first need to be able to objectively see
  what is happening around us. The key to this is ensuring your mind is clear.
  Marcus Aurelius compares having a sound mind to having healthy eyes. If you
  have healthy eyes, they should be able to see everything and distinguish
  between the many different colours they are exposed to. According to Aurelius,
  a mind “that keeps saying, ‘Are my children all right?’ or ‘Everyone must
  approve of me’ is like eyes that can only stand pale colours, or teeth that
  can handle only mush.” A mind that is healthy and clear is one that handles
  emotional responses and maintains objectivity at all times.


  So what are some tactical ways to do that? Personally, I enjoy the practice of
  meditation and daily journaling. Meditation helps me realize that as chaotic a
  day can become, I still have the power within me to find stillness and calm.
  Daily journaling also allows me to put down the jumbled thoughts and feelings
  in my head onto a piece of paper. Seeing these thoughts and feelings on paper
  allows me to assess them objectively and reduce their power over me,
  especially if they are negative feelings or thoughts. In a way, Aurelius’s
  entries into _Meditations_ was likely a method for him to process his thoughts
  and maintain objectivity.


  So keep your mind clear. And as the Zen saying goes, keep your “mind like
  water”. Open, flexible, and resilient.

  If you’ve enjoyed this summary, you’ll likely also enjoy some other Stoic
  philosophy. Ryan Holliday has a fantastic book called [_The Obstacle Is the
  Way_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-obstacle-is-the-way/)
  which draws from the many lessons from historical Stoics including Marcus
  Aurelius. You’ll likely also enjoy _The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from
  a Stoic Master_ which is an audiobook of the letters written by another Stoic
  master, Lucius Annaeus Seneca.

  "The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it.
  Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being… Then do it,
  without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With
  humility. Without hypocrisy."

Marcus Aurelius (121-180 AD) was a Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD. He is known as the last of the Five Good Emperors and is considered one of the most important Stoic philosophers. His book, _Meditations_, was written as a personal guidebook to answer some of the greatest questions of life. Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How should we ensure that we do what is right?

_Meditations_ is a popular book read by leaders in business, politics, sports, and many other fields. The lessons, even after almost 2000 years, are still applicable to the challenges that we face today. Aurelius shares his take on a wide range of topics including the importance of humility, the transient nature of human life, and how our mission as people is to help each other. Although I am an amateur when it comes to Greek and Roman philosophy, I thoroughly enjoyed reading _Meditations_ and found the lessons highly applicable to my life.

If you haven’t already read _Meditations_, I would recommend putting it on your list soon. I specifically recommend the translation by Gregory Hayes as it does a fantastic job making it accessible for modern readers.
