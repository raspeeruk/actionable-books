  ### Master everyday conversations


  > "We work on specialized conversations—presentation skills, negotiating
  skills, sales approaches, conflict resolution. We have not focused on the
  everyday conversations that make up most of our life—catching up with each
  other, exchanging commitments, showing appreciation, sharing concerns, making
  decisions."- Meetings Matter, page 25


  Someone once told me that public speaking will always be intimidating if I’m
  not working on eye contact and other basic presentation skills every night
  with my family over the dinner table.


  Paul Axtell has similar advice about meetings. If we master everyday
  conversation skills, we can improve our meetings. He outlines four basic
  elements of effective conversation: clarity, candor, commitment and
  completion.


  *   Clarity is about making sure everyone leaves a conversation without
  confusion about what was really said and meant.

  *   Candor is “not about saying anything and everything that occurs to you.”
  Instead, it’s about saying what needs to be said if there will ever be
  alignment.

  *   Commitment takes a conversation beyond mere discussion to make sure
  everyone agrees on what will happen next.

  *   Completion is sticking with a topic long enough for everything to be said
  that needs to be said.


  If we can master these elements when deciding where to vacation next summer,
  we’ll be better prepared to make every professional meeting matter.

  ### Game-plan each conversation


  > "If you love sports, you might think of the design for a meeting as similar
  to having a good ‘game plan.’ A team with a good game plan will not only be
  more likely to succeed, but the game will also be more enjoyable for those
  participating."- Meetings Matter, page 89


  In the above quote, Axtell uses a word that’s not often associated with
  meetings: enjoyable. Is it wrong to expect our meetings to be enjoyable for
  everyone who’s in the room, on the call or reading the follow-up notes after
  it’s over?


  To make meetings matter (and be more enjoyable), Axtell encourages us to take
  an active role in designing the conversation. How will it start? Where will it
  end? What will happen in between?


  After evaluating the content of hundreds of meetings, he discovered that six
  conversation designs cover most:


  1.  Checking progress on projects, goals, or initiatives

  2.  Requesting input from the group

  3.  Responding to a problem

  4.  Starting a project

  5.  Making a decision

  6.  Creating alignment for a goal, decision or plan


  He then provides process steps for each. For example, if you’re designing a
  meeting to respond to a problem, process questions to answer might include:
  What do we know, what questions are to be answered, what criteria should shape
  our response, what are our options, are there other thoughts and what will we
  do.


  Again, the goal of meeting design is not manipulation. It’s empathy for each
  participant. Axtell cautions that “most of us walk into meetings concerned
  about one person—ourselves. We’re not usually looking out for other
  participants or thinking about how to support the person leading the meeting.”


  But by improving our relationships and mastering our everyday conversations,
  we can create a quality experience for everyone in the meeting.


  In fact, Axtell hopes we start to feel like the oarsmen in David Halberstam’s
  book, _The Amateurs_: “When most oarsmen talked about their perfect moments in
  a boat, they referred not so much to winning a race, as to the feel of the
  boat, all eight oars in the water together, the synchronization almost
  perfect. In moments like these, the boat seemed to lift right out of the
  water. Oarsmen called that the moment of swing.”


  Let’s make our next meetings that boat. And let’s achieve the moment of swing.

  ### Develop a system to track relationships


  > "This is not about getting ahead. This is not about manipulating people.
  This is simply a way to remember and add value to important business
  relationships. And ultimately this is about making it easy for them and for
  you to be effective when you work together."- Meetings Matter, page 63


  If we want to master everyday conversations—in professional settings or
  elsewhere—we really should know who we’re talking to. We need to know and care
  about each other’s joys, frustrations and challenges. If we don’t, our
  conversations will suffer and our time in meetings will be misspent.


  In Axtell’s opinion, a great way to build supportive relationships is to
  develop a tracking system. While that may sound gimmicky, our culture bombards
  us with too much information to pretend this can be done any other way.


  To stress this point, Axtell shares a pre-internet story about a successful
  rancher. For more than fifty years, this man kept a detailed diary of every
  person he met and what was talked about. Not because he had a grand scheme to
  sell anything. Because he cared.


  Once we have a system, Axtell suggests we reconnect with two people each week.
  And he offers this Dale Carnegie quote to keep our motivations pure: “You can
  make more friends in two months by being interested in other people than in
  two years of trying to get people interested in you.”

  conversation is like a puzzle with all the pieces in place. Improving your
  meetings by improving your conversations is not mysterious, but the impact can

> "Meetings are, in essence, a series of conversations, and effective conversation is like a puzzle with all the pieces in place. Improving your meetings by improving your conversations is not mysterious, but the impact can be dramatic." _\- Meetings Matter, page 4_

If you’re like the rest of us, a typical workweek consists of meeting after meeting after meeting with several meetings added—at the last minute, of course—into any remaining gaps in your calendar.

In _Meetings Matter: 8 Powerful Strategies for Remarkable Conversations_, Paul Axtell doesn’t expend energy bemoaning the prevalence of meetings. Instead, he makes them seem less, well, meeting-like by zeroing in on what they’re ultimately all about: conversations and relationships.

In Axtell’s words, “each person, each conversation, and each moment are what really matters.” As a result of this gracious, empathetic mindset, his advice throughout the book is practical without ever seeming prescriptive or, worse, manipulative.

To hammer home his point that better conversations lead to better relationships, he shares a story from his childhood. Each Christmas, his grandmother, Esther, had one demand: at some point, everyone had to spend two hours in the same room taking turns talking about whatever came to mind.

If we approach each meeting the way Esther approached the holiday, we’ll enjoy successful meetings—and greater success in everyday life.
