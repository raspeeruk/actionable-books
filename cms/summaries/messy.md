  ### Messy Situations Provide Fertile Creative Soils


  > "Messy disruptions will be most powerful when combined with creative skill.
  The disruption puts an artist, scientist or engineer in unpromising territory
  - a deep valley rather than a familiar hilltop."- Messy, page 15


  Some of the greatest discoveries were borne out of messy circumstances.
  Penicillin, post-it notes and microwaves are all examples of disruptive
  circumstances leading to great results.


  Forever enshrined in scientific legend, the discovery of penicillin is really
  just a case of dirty dishes. When Scottish biologist Alexander Fleming
  returned from vacation, he found a strange fungus on a culture he had left in
  his lab, a fungus that had killed off all surrounding bacteria in the culture.
  Modern medicine was never the same.


  In the opening story of the book, Keith Jarrett first refused to play on the
  piano that was put to his disposal at the Cologne Opera House, but eventually
  produced the performance of a lifetime. The shortcomings of the piano actually
  helped him.


  Luck favors the brave, and we can create environments that encourage this way
  of thinking, by creating the right conditions for the new ideas to find their
  way. Creativity can be boosted by getting away from the everyday and
  disrupting our routines.


  Imagine you take the same route each day to get to work with the London
  Underground, and one day you are forced to change because of a two-day strike
  that closes 171 of the Tube’s 270 stations. You have no choice but to try
  alternative routes using buses, overground trains and the stations that
  remained open.


  This happened in 2014 and some researchers could observe that when the strike
  was over, not everybody returned to their habitual route. One in twenty of the
  commuters who had switched then stayed with the route that they had used
  during the strike. It was faster, cheaper or preferable in some other way to
  their old routine. All they needed was an unexpected shock to force them to
  seek out something better.


  Understanding the benefits of such an experience, why not decide to try a new
  route even without a strike next time?

  ### Use Mess to Win by Dictating the Rhythm


  > "In a competitive situation, you win by beating your opponent. Sometimes the
  opponent is relevant only as a benchmark; a 100m sprinter can tune out his
  rivals and focus on the finishing line. But many competitors - a chess player,
  a boxer, a military commander, a business leader, a politician - cannot ignore
  the opposition. And one way to win is to encourage your opponent to lose."-
  Messy, page 127


  Mess is not only an advantage, it is also a weapon. In the chapter about
  “Winning”, Tim Harford tells three stories: the story of Lieutenant Erwin
  Rommel of the German army during First World War, the story of Amazon founder
  Jeff Bezos, and the story of Donald Trump, the next President of the United
  States of America. These three people mastered the use of mess in a deliberate
  way to build their path to victory.


  The idea is based on a simple mechanism. It is about creating a chaotic
  situation that nobody understands and taking the opportunity to improvise a
  way through the mess before the opponent. This tactic works as much as the
  opponent shows an over-elaboration of details, rigidity of mind, and
  reluctance to change positions as swiftly and readily as the situation
  demands.


  The three leaders mentioned above had an action plan, but they were able to
  adapt quickly and part of their tactics was about agility and “breaking” the
  rules of the game.


  Rommel did it by privileging speed over safety, expecting opponents to be
  destabilized by this choice. Bezos did it by launching new businesses before
  being able to deliver—Barnes and Noble had the following attitude to
  e-reading: “when the market is here, we’ll be there”—an attitude that allowed
  Bezos and Amazon to take the advantage. Trump used inflammatory comments to
  create buzz and set traps to his opponents. Once they fell into it, he mocked
  his rivals on Twitter. His opponents were destabilized and were not able to
  offer a proper reaction. It can be a risky strategy, but the payoffs can be
  proportionate.

  ### Embrace your Messiness


  > "We are tidy-minded people, instinctively admiring order and in denial about
  the way mess tends to be the inevitable by-product of good things, and is
  sometimes a good thing in its own right."- Messy, page 249


  Benjamin Franklin aspired to thirteen virtues among which we find frugality,
  industry, sincerity, and cleanliness. He tracked his progress throughout his
  life with a daily reflection in a specific notebook. Despite his brilliant
  career and many accomplishments, he never mastered virtue of order, which he
  defined with the statement: ”Let all your things have their places; let each
  part of your business have its time.” This gave him great frustration, and
  strangers who came to see him were amazed that tremendously important
  documents were scattered carelessly on the table and floor.


  Franklin himself was convinced that if he could fix this deficiency in his
  character and become less messy, he would become a more admirable, successful,
  and productive person. One of the most determined men to ever live could not
  find success with something that looks like a very simple task.


  Why did he fail in this regard?


  Perhaps he realized, on some unconscious level, that disorderliness was not an
  impediment to success, and could even be a contribution to all the other great
  things he created, discovered, and accomplished within his life.


  Furthermore, despite appearances, a big pile of paper is very far from being a
  random mess. My messy workspace might be difficult for another person to deal
  with, but it is a reflection of my journey, my work, and my creative process.
  That’s not a failure.
f_conclusion: >-
  As a person who struggles with order (building many paper piles), and who
  works with companies to help them become more creative and better innovators,
  I enjoyed reading this book very much. Harford makes his arguments through
  stories and examples which appeal to me. Through all these examples, _Messy_
  shows that what seems random can also be part of a deliberate plan. Planning
  randomness and mess can be a competitive advantage in multiple situations, and
  it is up to us to expand the field of application and put a little bit of mess
  in our lives.

> “...people respond to unexpected stimuli and constraints all the time. We just don’t call it randomness. A good conversation is a constant stream of unexpected responses. A new collaboration forces fresh perspectives and demands attention.” _\- Messy, page 23_

Tim Harford is an economist, journalist and broadcaster. Looking at familiar situations in unfamiliar ways, _The Undercover Economist,_ his first book, is a fresh explanation of the fundamental principles of the modern economy.

In _Messy_, Tim Harford explores how the human qualities that we value—creativity, collaboration, resilience—can benefit from disorder and confusion as soon as we decide to embrace the constraint instead of resisting it.

The author defines nine chapters, each one addresses a specific topic in which “a little bit of mess” can sometimes lead to better outcomes. He made it very concrete through numerous examples in which he identifies what the mess could be and how it could help in our everyday life. The examples are interspersed with research from neuroscience, psychology and social science.

Nevertheless the book is more than a collection of examples and asserts a powerful but counterintuitive idea that our “messy” parts ca contribute to our success.
