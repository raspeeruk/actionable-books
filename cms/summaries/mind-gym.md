  ### Reduce autopilot and get in the driver’s seat


  > "The truth is, you have control of your thoughts, reactions, and responses.
  And once you understand how powerful that choice can be, you’ll be able to
  change more aspects of your life than you can imagine."- Mind Gym, page 8


  We often go about our daily activities without stopping to question what we’re
  doing or how we’re doing it. The authors refer to this as “autopilot—a state
  of going through the motions of your life without really paying attention to
  choice.” Much of this is due to habits, which we develop to minimize our
  mental energy when doing routine tasks. But being on autopilot is
  counterproductive when trying to solve a new problem or attempting to do
  something new.


  If we’re stuck on autopilot, getting unstuck is not easy. One solution is to
  increase reflection time. Scheduling thinking time into your day’s activities
  can enhance engagement. Following a task, reflect or contemplate on what went
  well, what could have gone better and what you could have done differently.


  Looking for something new can reduce autopilot or automatic thinking. Asking
  yourself “what has changed since the last time I walked down this street” or
  “what’s different about my friend today”? This kind of questioning helps you
  to “focus on the present—to become aware of your surroundings and not slip
  back into autopilot.”


  Once you’ve focused on the present, the next step is to ask yourself how you
  explain away experiences in your life.

  ### Question your assumptions to boost your creativity


  > "As our world becomes more systemized, hyper fast, and process driven, the
  ability to think creatively becomes a premium skill—a valuable asset in the
  workplace and in your personal life."- Mind Gym, page 216


  When faced with a new problem or challenge, do we approach it in the same way
  we’ve always approached new dilemmas? Becoming aware of these filters and then
  removing them can help us come up with different solutions. Filters are just
  “mental shortcuts” that we use to help us do everyday tasks faster.


  Bailey and Black propose we rephrase the problem and ask ourselves “What
  assumptions am I making?” We should review the solutions that don’t work and
  ask ourselves “Why don’t they work?” This line of questioning can lead to a
  new way of thinking.


  Sometimes letting a new problem or idea incubate and not feeling rushed to
  come up with a solution is helpful. The authors assert that “you need to leave
  a thought in your mind and trust that a creative idea will emerge without
  trying to force it.” They remind us that Einstein had his best ideas while
  taking a shower. You just never know when or where that burst of creativity
  will hit.


  If you want to expand your mental toolkit and improve your thinking, do the
  exercises in this valuable book. Flex your mental muscle for optimal
  performance. What problem will you solve with your newfound creativity?

  ### How we explain events in our lives is the key to optimism


  > "Challenging the way you look at a situation is probably the single most
  powerful thing you can do when it comes to altering your beliefs and trying to
  change from a pessimistic to an optimistic viewpoint."- Mind Gym, page 43


  The authors believe we all have an “explanatory style—a pattern of
  communication that reveals whether we perceive a particular event as either
  positive or negative.” The key difference is how these two types of
  individuals explain away positive and negative events in their lives.


  An optimist sees a recent positive event in his life as widespread and
  permanent. A pessimist on the other hand, would consider that as being lucky
  or temporary. The opposite is true with negative events. The pessimists view
  the negative event as universal and permanent while the optimists think it is
  just a temporary setback.


  The true benefit of an optimist lies in his reaction to a negative event. Not
  willing to give up so easily, the optimist still finds a way to focus on the
  upside. For example, if both an optimist and pessimist are rejected for a
  loan, the pessimist accepts it and moves on. An optimist, would ask themselves
  what they would need to do to increase their chances of getting a loan the
  next time.


  So how do you increase optimistic thinking in your life? Learn to spot
  optimistic and pessimistic thinking in your everyday interactions with
  friends, coworkers and family. How do they explain away the positive and
  negative events—universal and permanent or circumstantial and temporary?


  The authors also suggest a method borrowed from psychologist Martin Seligman.
  He recommends writing down three good things that happened during the day as
  well as what caused them. Following each positive item, write what it means to
  you. Do that for a month to increase happiness and awareness of connecting
  positive events to your actions.
