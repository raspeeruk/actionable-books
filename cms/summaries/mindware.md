  ### Assumptions Tend to be Wrong—Test Them


  > "The bad news is that our beliefs about many important aspects of the world
  are often sorely mistaken, and the ways in which we acquire them are often
  fundamentally flawed. "- Mindware, page 275


  Nisbett presents, throughout the sixteen chapters of the book, a compendium of
  concepts that can help us become aware of the way our assumptions fail us. He
  covers everything from logic errors, to a variety of “heuristics” and schemas
  that trip us up (e.g., things that are recent seem truer than things that are
  distant), to our tendency to not allow our unconscious to work when we get
  stuck (thus the value of sleep and of taking breaks.) Recognizing the
  significant limitations of our assumptions is a critical take-away. Like other
  authors who cover this territory from a psychology, neuroscience or economics
  lens, the message that we are better off being less certain is one of the
  primary ones of this book as well. Equally important is recognizing that we
  have many more opportunities than we might think to test our assumptions and
  beliefs and to think well.


  One of the methods we have for thinking better and making better decisions is
  by doing lots less assuming and lots more testing. One of the innovations of
  the Obama campaign was using A/B testing for its website design rather than
  doing what had been done before—i.e., trusting the the HiPPO (Highest-Paid
  Person’s Opinion.) The web developers set up A/B testing models. For example,
  they built two pages with different language and found out which language drew
  people in more. While exceedingly simple, this approach was new and
  innovative. Different combinations were tested and a rather counter-intuitive
  (at least to me) combination prevailed—which changed the nature of how
  campaign websites work.


  Nesbitt suggests examples of how we can apply A/B testing to business problems
  as well as personal ones. We can become experimenters rather than basing our
  decisions and actions on our (often flawed) assumptions. He also suggests that
  when we are evaluating decisions others have made and information that we
  receive, we should try to understand whether it is backed by assumptions—or
  experiments.

  ### The Sunk Cost Fallacy


  > "The economist’s motto, and it should be yours, is that the rest of your
  life begins now. Nothing that happened yesterday can be retrieved. No use
  crying over spilt milk. "- Mindware, page 86


  Here’s a relatively simple, yet very practical principle—and one that we can
  easily understand yet struggle to operate according to. It is almost never a
  good idea to keep going because you’re trying to “rescue” money you’ve already
  spent. Only future benefits and cost are relevant in your choices. If you’ve
  got tickets to a performance and you find the lead performer won’t be
  there—don’t go just because you’ve spent the money. Go only if it’s still what
  you want to do.


  In a business context—don’t continue with a plan that’s not working just
  because of money you’ve spent to date. Cut your losses. At its worst, in the
  public arena, this fallacy has not infrequently been used as justification for
  continuing wars—so that the fallen won’t have died in vain.


  Nisbett does tell us that the sunk cost fallacy is not an excuse for walking
  out of a relationship that takes work—so be careful how you apply this one!

  ### Context Matters


  > "A direct consequence of… ‘context blindness’ is that we tend to exaggerate
  the influence of personal, 'dispositional' factors—preferences, personality
  traits, abilities, plans and motives—on behavior in a given situation. "-
  Mindware, page 34


  Our inability to recognize the importance of context and to overestimate
  personality is the source of what Nisbett calls the “most pervasive and
  consequential inference mistake” that we make in our lives. So much so that
  this has been labeled as the “fundamental attribution error.”


  Here’s a study that makes this error exceptionally clear. Seminary students
  (people we tend to think will help others in need) were sent to a building
  across campus to deliver a sermon on the Good Samaritan (yes, really!) and
  told what path to take. Some students had lots of time to get there; others
  were told they were running late already. In both situations, they encountered
  a person sitting, groaning and coughing in a doorway. What percentage of
  students offered help?


  The answer: if the students had lots of time—almost two-thirds stopped to
  help. If they were running late—just 10% stopped.


  Not only does context influence behavior—it’s also hard for us to believe it
  does. Most people, when told about this situation, do not expect the
  seminarian running late to behave differently from the one who has lots of
  time. We believe it’s about the person, not the situation—unless we are the
  person, in which case we give a lot more credence to context.


  If we can recognize this error and then step back and think about context, we
  can make better hiring decisions and management decisions—in fact, any
  decision we make about people can be made more generously and more
  effectively.
f_conclusion: >-
  I love books that challenge our thinking about our thinking—I especially love
  books that help us become better thinkers. Nisbett does both. And, as with all
  good books in this genre, I walk away both humbled by the realization that I
  will continue to misinterpret, be certain when I shouldn’t be, and believe I
  know what I really don’t. I also walk away hoping that I’ll be a little bit
  more aware of my not knowing, and will get better and better at using new
  tools to think, reason and intuit better—and to catch myself when I am wrong.

  "…All perceptions, judgments, and beliefs are inferences and not direct
  readouts of reality. This recognition should prompt an appropriate humility
  about just how certain we should be about our judgments, as well as a
  recognition that the views of other people that differ from our own may have
  more validity than our intuitions tell us they do."

Richard Nisbett, a renowned psychologist who Malcolm Gladwell calls the most influential thinker in his life, joins others, including Daniel Kahnemann ([_Thinking Fast and Slow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/)) and Chip and Dan Heath ([_Decisive_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/decisive/)), in exploring how our thinking works for—and against us. Many of the conclusions he reaches and some of the examples he brings may be familiar to readers of these authors. Reading Nesbitt’s book reinforced, clarified and solidified my understanding of what I’d already learned. His explanations are clear, examples easy to comprehend (and often fun), and there are studies galore to read about.

Nesbitt also demonstrates ways to think better—and presents many practical and immediately useful tools and concepts. Finally, Nesbitt includes a discussion about Western and Eastern thought—demonstrating that some of what Westerners consider absolute truth is not part of the Eastern way of thinking—and vice versa. To recognize that our definitions of logic are not universal is humbling—and to understand the value of dialectical thinking, an Eastern alternative, opens up new ways of thinking about what is true.
