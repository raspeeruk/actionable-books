  ### The Dragon Lady


  > "Eileen could pick out the best… From the very beginning… the title 'Ford
  model' carried a cachet all its own. Ford models were seen as the aristocrats
  of their profession… stature in every sense of the word, including mental
  discipline and punctuality."- Model Woman, page 94


  In today’s age of women being told to “lean in” and support one another, I was
  at times surprised at how harsh and direct Eileen was throughout her career.
  She was known in some circles as the Dragon Lady. Her opinions and criticisms
  were never meant to be personal. She had an eye for what types of girls would
  be able to sell advertising, photos, and products. If you weren’t it, she
  wasn’t shy about letting you know. But once you were in, you were family.


  Like any good business leader, Eileen protected her investments, which were
  her models. She had stringent standards for decorum, for both her girls and
  the photographers shooting them. She also had certain types of products and
  photo shoots that were beneath the standards of what it meant to be a Ford
  model.


  My greatest takeaway is how Eileen was both strict and loving. At the end of
  her life, she had so many people that were grateful for what she did for them.
  In the moment, and from the outside, it may have looked like she should relax
  her standards. But her high standards are part of what built the business that
  she built and changed the industry for the better.

  ### Find the right partner


  > "Eileen had always cultivated the style of the scrappy shop steward in her
  protective demeanor toward her girls. Now Jerry engaged in the same battle for
  better pay and conditions… 'It was Jerry... who introduced cancellation fees,
  fitting fees, and weather-permitting fees to the modeling business, without
  any shouting.'"- Model Woman, page 93


  As it always seems, many business partnerships come together as if by magic.
  Eileen’s husband Jerry never had aspirations of going into the modeling
  business. As luck and circumstance would have it, Jerry was the perfect yin to
  Eileen’s yang.


  The earliest version of the Ford Modeling Agency was a partnership between
  Eileen Ford and Natalie Nickerson in the 1940s. Ultimately, Eileen acted as a
  secretary and booker for Natalie, and Natalie helped to get more models on
  board. The challenge with the agencies in the 1940s is that they were
  disorganized. Although they booked the models for jobs, models didn’t always
  get pertinent information on where to go, when to be there, or what supplies
  and accessories they should have with them. Eileen’s fierce attention to
  detail was what made her agency different.


  Though Natalie was Eileen’s first partner, it was Jerry who really helped to
  transform the business. He inadvertently stepped in to help when Eileen was in
  the hospital after the birth of their first child and he never left. While
  Eileen had a good eye for talent and what made the business run, Jerry had a
  great sense for people and business. Among many other things, Jerry negotiated
  some of the highest earnings for models for decades. Without Jerry, Ford never
  would have been as dominant as it was.


  While Eileen often got the lion’s share of the credit, she never could have
  done it alone. It’s important to find people that balance your talents,
  strengths, and weaknesses with their own. Forge great partnerships.

  ### Empower your people


  > "I consider that I am directly carrying on my mother’s work. Freedom for All
  is about fighting for the protection of women against largely male abuse,
  while giving them empowerment to build up their own lives. That’s exactly what
  my mother and father fought for in the world of modeling."- Katie Ford, Model
  Woman, page 254


  Eileen grew up in a household where she was expected to do great things. At a
  time where women were considered the “weaker sex”, Eileen had great ambition
  for herself and her models. She helped to change modeling. It is no longer a
  profession where, ultimately, women are controlled by men. Eileen and her
  husband Jerry Ford helped the modeling industry become a world where women
  could demand top dollar for their looks and talent, and be paid for what they
  helped create. They are no longer the “hired help”. She began a movement for
  empowerment.


  I don’t live or work in the world of modeling. But I do live and work in a
  world where empowerment is important. It’s easy to fulfill the status quo. But
  true growth and breakthrough comes when you look for ways to empower your
  people. Eileen had a way of identifying girls that she knew would be top
  models, and then empowering them in front of the camera by encouraging them,
  as well as in their personal lives by making sure they were taken care of,
  often in a motherly way if necessary. She made sure they had food to eat and a
  place to sleep, or something to move on to after their modeling careers ended.
  She told them that they would be stars. She helped to lift them up. How will
  you empower your people to make a difference for themselves and for others
  through their work?

I chose _Model Woman: Eileen Ford and the Business of Beauty_, because I wanted to learn what one woman did to create a business by women, in many ways for women, in a time when women weren’t prominent business leaders. Before picking this book up, I didn’t know much about Eileen Ford or modeling as an industry. I’m a woman so it’s fair to say that I have lived my life as a target of the modeling industry! But I do know a lot about entrepreneurship, so this made for an interesting and insightful read.

Readers should be aware that this is ultimately a biography about Eileen. While the early chapters about Eileen’s life before modeling certainly shaped who she was as a business owner, I didn’t find them nearly as intriguing as the later chapters.
