  ### Be a Leader, not a Manager


  > "Rather, I succeeded because I reoriented each company toward the needs of
  the market it serves. To do this, I learned to rely more in the frontline
  people, who deal with the customers, and less on my own edicts. In other
  words, once I had learned how to be a leader rather than a manager, I was able
  to open up each company to new, market-oriented possibilities and to the
  creative energy of its employees."- Moments of Truth, page 19


  Carlzon goes into detail about doing away with the prestige of leadership. He
  wanted to be supportive of his employees so they could provide the service
  they always wanted to. He frames leadership as setting the example of behaving
  the way he wants his employees to behave, not by giving orders. Instead, he
  trusted their judgment and set high expectations. He demonstrated high
  personal integrity, humility and respect that spread throughout the company.
  His tough expectations for the company were happily met by employees because
  he believed in them.

  ### Results Oriented Leadership


  > "A leader is not appointed because he knows everything and can make every
  decision. He is appointed to bring together the knowledge that is available
  and then create the prerequisites for the work to be done."- Moments of Truth,
  page 32


  Leading is a choice, not a job. An effective leader asks what needs to be done
  and brings together the resources to do it which creates results. An
  ineffective leader barks orders and casts blame which creates a resentful,
  powerless frontline. Be a results-oriented leader. Choose to lead in a manner
  that communicates a common goal and values those who will achieve the goal.
  Leadership is not about power or social relationships, it is about guidance
  and support. The real insight here is everyone wins. The leader can release
  the responsibility for things they never really controlled and focus on
  communicating goals, listening to problems and providing the resources to
  solve them. The frontline can achieve the victory now that they have knowledge
  of the goal and the resources to do it. Do you clearly communicate goals and
  help people stay focused? How can you be a resource? Do you show appreciation?
  This is the core of results-oriented leadership.

  ### Delegating Responsibility Through Empowerment


  > "Anyone who is not given information cannot assume responsibility. But
  anyone who is given information, cannot avoid assuming it. Once they
  understood our vision, our employees accepted responsibility enthusiastically,
  which sparked numerous simultaneous and energetic developments in the
  company."- Moments of Truth, page 27


  Carlzon calls it the “moment of truth”, the company’s core ideas, decisions,
  and actions are determined within the first 15 seconds of contact a frontline
  employee has with a customer. If that employee does not have the authority,
  information or resources they need the customer forms a negative impression of
  the company. If they can take advantage of their golden opportunity to exceed
  the customer’s expectations for service, the company earns the customer’s
  loyalty. This is what determines the success or failure of the company.
  Communicating larger goals to employees helps them see beyond daily tasks.
  Giving them the power to achieve them with their own authority creates the
  atmosphere of respect and personal empowerment. Most mistakes can be
  corrected, so when mistakes are made it is important to make it a positive
  learning experience and not a failure. An employee does a better job when they
  feel valued and respected. What does 15 seconds of spectacular service look
  like? Are there decisions and actions that get delayed because the right
  people do not have knowledge and authority? The quality of service speaks
  volumes to the customer about the quality of the company.
f_conclusion: >-
  What impressed me was the sense of balance and high level of employee
  engagement that resonated through the large organizations Carlzon headed. No
  one shouldered too much responsibility or took too much credit because the
  results were everyone’s victory. In my experience this is not usually the way
  it works. Sometimes in a leadership role it is forbidden to let go of the
  rules and the scripts because those things are set up to produce consistency,
  control employees and to get predictable results. Many of us work in a pyramid
  structured company that is not going to change because it has worked for many
  years. The one thing we can all agree with is that everyone needs to be
  understood because we are all human. It is far more rewarding in the end to
  make that connection and understand than it is to be right. By actively
  listening to the people we work with and to our customers with the goal of
  understanding and recognizing their individual obstacles, that sense of
  balance and engagement is achievable even if we cannot change the rules.
  Positive results will follow. Understanding and doing all we can is the
  clearest way to communicate respect. When people are respected they return
  respect, and there is a natural sense of balance and inevitable engagement.
  This is a very practical way to “flatten the pyramid” and improve a work
  situation when you have to work within the company’s structure.

  "If you can flatten your own pyramids you will be creating a far more powerful
  and resilient organization that not only serves customers better but also
  unleashes the hidden energy within your employees. The results can be
  absolutely astounding."

In _Moments of Truth_, Jan Carlzon shares his secret to top-notch success in the airline industry through solid leadership and the creation of a customer-oriented business strategy. He calls it the “flattened pyramid.” It is linear with a focus on empowering the frontline rather than the traditional hierarchical business model. Top management focuses on developing strategy and putting it into action. Middle managers focus on planning and allocating resources. Frontline operations are where all the specific decisions are made. Those who directly serve the customers then can create an ideal service experience.
