  ### Focus on Failure


  > "Successful people learn from failure. In fact, most successful people fail
  faster and more often than the average person. They learn from failure to
  become successful."- Monday Morning Choices, page 89


  In my daily life things go wrong all the time. The myriad of ways in which
  failure occurs can range from a work project blowing up to a personal
  relationship that sours to almost anything in between. One of my core
  competencies is being able to deal with these failures in a way that contains
  the problem. I am a capable firefighter and will not get derailed by something
  going sideways. Like many of you, I focus on the solution, not the problem.


  As I consider how to apply the “persistence choice” in my daily life, I have
  realized that the solution focus may not be the right choice for me. I need to
  think more about the root cause and systemic issues that create this
  “sideways” scenario. A more critical look at my failures may present
  opportunities to avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

  ### Optimism and Passion


  > "We have an opportunity to choose our attitude for each decision everyday…"-
  Monday Morning Choices, page 100


  Cottrell reminds us that we have the opportunity to choose our attitude on a
  daily basis. It is entirely up to us. We need to consider that there will be
  challenges but a proactive and optimistic approach is in all of us. As a
  firefighter my attitude tends to what is required to fight today’s fire – I’m
  incredibly reactive. I am going take 10 minutes on Monday mornings, to reflect
  on the week ahead and establish my attitude. I will work not to get
  sidetracked during the day.

  ### Build Powerful Relationships


  > "By surrounding yourself with others who choose commitment and passion,
  you’ll find yourself making more progress."- Monday Morning Choices, page 22


  When considering our passion choice, Cottrell asks us to find those who share
  our passion and commitment. He logically points out that those with a shared
  passion feed off each other and are in a position to achieve more. I need to
  focus on finding other avenues where I get connected with others that share my
  passion to excel and discover. I am going to leverage my networks and social
  media to create the group approach to rereading _Monday Morning Choices_ that
  Cottrell suggests.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Monday Morning Choices_ poses important questions to consider and brings some
  of those unconscious choices we make into the spotlight for new examination.
  Additionally, David Cottrell has provided an excellent tool to guide you in
  the reexamination of these choices.

Often it is the little choices we make (or don’t) that lead us down unintended paths. David Cottrell’s _Monday Morning Choices_ creates awareness for us to identify these choices and focus on making sound and considered decisions. The result is the creation of an environment where we consciously decide to move our lives in a positive direction. Cottrell’s book asks us to evaluate each of these choices on Mondays and promises that in a 12-week timeframe a transformation will have occurred – “Change your Mondays, Change your Life”!

_Monday Morning Choices_ categorizes the choices we make in three overarching categories:

1) _Character Choices_ ask us to examine and affirm that we choose not to be victims, that we have passion, and that our values are in check and our integrity is appropriately framed.

2) _Action Choices_ challenge us towards creating a bias for action, to never give up, to display appropriate enthusiasm and to embrace adversity.

3) _Investment Choices_ challenge us to develop meaningful relationships, seek and learn from criticism, consistently face the truth and build you legacy.

Cottrell suggests a “slow read” approach and advocates creation of a discussion group to give readers the opportunity to share their thoughts.
