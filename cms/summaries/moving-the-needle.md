  ### Clarity is key


  > "When you get quiet, you get clear enough to ask yourself, ‘What am I
  pursuing and why?’"- Moving the Needle, page 4


  Increasing clarity adds laser-like focus to what we want to achieve. When
  you’re clear on what you want and why, you can answer the question of what
  success looks like and go after it with unstoppable passion.


  One of the first steps you can take to increase clarity is to make time for
  reflection and awareness in your life. Quiet time for the mind is similar to a
  tune-up for a car. It increases your mind’s performance and runs better.
  Meditation can achieve this as well as reflection.


  The author suggests keeping a journal and asking probing questions to increase
  awareness of where you currently are in your life. Questions such as the
  following are helpful:


  *   Where do you think you are in terms of fulfillment and satisfaction in
  your life?

  *   Are you finding happiness and taking pride in what you are accomplishing?

  *   Have you found the sweet spot where you are being your best in all areas
  of life?


  Removing clutter and finding balance in your life are also beneficial in
  helping you achieve clarity. The author recommends writing out what your ideal
  day would like to help identify what activities should be included in your
  day. If you focus on completing tasks you should be doing, then there’s less
  time for items that are not important.


  So when you’ve achieved clarity and figured out what is truly important to
  you, then you are ready to take action by freeing yourself from whatever
  obstacles stand in your way.

  ### Differentiate yourself


  > "Contemplate your uniqueness and what differentiates you from others. You
  want to figure out how you can become more desirable, uniquely attainable and
  economically irresistible. Understanding this is a key step in getting
  clear."- Moving the Needle, page 61


  Whether it’s personal branding or finding a way to stand out in today’s
  competitive economy, differentiating ourselves is vital. The author uses the
  example of Apple and how it differentiated itself from the competition and
  ended up dominating their market. Apple achieved this by understanding its
  customers and figuring out what their needs would be in the future.


  Sweeney suggests we apply the same thinking to our careers to figure out what
  our customers’ or bosses’ future needs would be. Keep asking how we can
  differentiate ourselves from our competition. How can we add value? Asking why
  can sometimes help to dig out the true reason you want to achieve something.
  Keep asking why till you’re happy with the result.


  Lastly, following through and taking action can help us stand out from the
  competition. As Sweeney adds, “people remember when you follow through on
  something you said you were going to do”.

  ### Free yourself from any behavior holding you back


  > "Getting free is all about creating the proper mind-set when interacting
  with people, planning activities, managing money and looking at life, as well
  as eliminating self-limiting thoughts."- Moving the Needle, page 87


  According to Sweeney, one of the first steps to getting free is accepting
  responsibility for our actions. Accepting what happens in our life causes us
  to change course when mistakes are made, learn from them and come back
  stronger and more resilient for the next challenge we face.


  Perspective also plays a key role in freedom since it affects your interaction
  with people and decision-making throughout the day. As Sweeney notes, “With
  the proper perspective, you’ll see a lot more opportunities in your life—and
  experience freedom.”


  Reflecting on our regular habits and the people we interact with on a daily
  basis can highlight limiting thoughts and behaviors. This is all about having
  habits that enhance our energy and power us throughout the day (such as
  exercise, and healthy eating). It is also about the people we surround
  ourselves with and how they affect our thoughts and behaviors. Do they
  energize and inspire us?

  This valuable book contains nuggets of actionable advice that can be put to
  immediate use. Find clarity in your life on what you truly want and get going
  on your goals. What’s stopping you?
