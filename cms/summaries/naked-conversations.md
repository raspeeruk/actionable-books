  ### Welcome to the Conversation Era


  > "The fundamental argument of this book is not to eliminate marketing, but to
  change it to something more conversational."- Naked Conversations, page 97


  Blogging enables companies to deepen relationships with their customers and
  other key stakeholders. Deepening relationships with customers allows
  companies to develop better products and services because you will have access
  to honest feedback and be privy to customer desires and problems. While other
  companies are guessing what customers really want, you don’t have to guess.


  Blogs also help you build trust with customers by humanizing your company and
  letting customers get to know the people behind the company. With this
  increased trust comes an increased propensity to buy.


  Finally, by listening to and engaging with your customers through blogs, you
  stand an increased chance that your customers will become advocates for you.
  Not only will they be more likely to buy from you, they’ll also be likely to
  refer other customers, stand up for you against unfair attacks and give you
  the benefit of the doubt and time to handle a crisis.


  To get these benefits and avoid the potential pitfalls with blogging, you must
  follow the rules.

  ### Be Authentic


  > "Credibility is very much like virginity. Once you lose it, it is impossible
  to regain."- Naked Conversations, page 201


  In business and in life, your reputation is everything. You can spend years
  building credibility and lose it all because of one bad decision. With
  blogging, authenticity is a key component of building your credibility.


  The problem with corpspeak is that it deadens the truth to what is being said.
  Weighed down by lawyers and PR professionals, the language coming out of
  spokespeople’s mouths is more legal/risk-avoidant and less relatable to our
  audience. Blogging authentically means to blog with passions and convictions,
  to speak your truth (even if it means admitting a competitor’s product is
  better or that your product could be improved). As you begin speaking your
  truth, customers will trust you.


  Blogging has definitely impacted marketing, making conversations with
  customers critical to a successful marketing program. Rather than speaking to
  customers whenever we want, marketers must be sure to talk with customers when
  the customer wants to interact. Blogs enable marketers to do just this.

  when looking at products and services than when evaluating communication
  tools. There is no ROI connected with a press release, a web site, or a
  corporate brochure. Nor is there any ROI attached to the value of a CEO
  spending three days traveling to and attending an executive conference where
  he speaks for 20 minutes. But most companies understand the value.”_

  ### Blogging Rules


  > "One simple rule for doing it right is be real. If you are going to blog, be
  authentic. Keep your conversations naked."- Naked Conversations, page 149


  Perhaps one of the most important rules in blogging is to be yourself. Readers
  are sick of “corpspeakers,” people who use an “oxymoronic hybrid of cautious
  legalese seasoned with marketing hyperbole”. Rather than the traditional PR
  method of command and control, this book suggests that PR and marketing should
  shift to listening and participating. Rather than blasting PR releases that
  are touched by a dozen people and full of corpspeak, blogging is more
  conversational and touched only once. This shift helps keep the conversation
  natural and creates a culture of transparency.


  In addition to authenticity, _Naked Conversations_ offers a variety of other
  tips for successful blogging:


  *   Talk, don’t sell

  *   Post often and be interesting

  *   Write on issues you know and care about

  *   Blogging saves money but costs time

  *   You get smarter by listening to what other people tell you


  Regarding whether or not you should blog, the authors offer a few guidelines:


  *   “If you are a genuine bad guy, or are part of an organization of bad guys,
  don’t blog.”

  *   “The dull should not blog.”

  *   “If a habitual exaggerator tries blogging, he or she is likely to learn
  it’s the wrong venue…blogging is a venue best avoided for those prone to
  hyperbole.”


  At the end of the day, there are no rules for blogging. There are certain
  guidelines that you should follow, but Naked Conversations is filled with
  examples of entrepreneurs, CEOs, and regular Joe’s who chose to ignore some
  rules while implementing others. At the end of the day, the most important
  thing is to be yourself.


  _“If you want to be a top-level blogger, you need to get over your fear of
  breaking the rules.”_

In the last decade, marketing has undergone a major shift from one-directional messages to conversations. The primary reason for the shift is the widespread acceptance of blogs. Blogs provide a number of benefits to organizations, including greater access to honest feedback from customers.

_Naked Conversations: How Blogs are Changing the Way Businesses Talk with Customers_ by Robert Scoble and Shel Israel takes us into the world of corporate blogging, weighs the pros and cons for companies, and gives us some guidelines to follow should we decide to enter into a conversation with our customers.
