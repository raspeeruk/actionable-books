  ### Step back and look at the big picture


  > "…no aspect of human behavior could be understood in isolation: neurology,
  genetics, family background, and social dynamics all had to be considered to
  properly evaluate a patient’s mental state."- NeuroTribes, page 156


  Whilst this book is about the history of autism, the ability to consider the
  big picture is vital for everyone’s own health and wellbeing, at work and
  home. Today’s society has many potential stressors, and being able to step
  back and observe how these are impacting our own behavior, as well as that of
  others, is crucial if we are to maintain our own wellbeing and accept that
  some things are not within our control.


  This is a philosophy and approach that is discussed with clients who are
  seeking to understand their own beliefs and assumptions in relation to
  multiple and wide-ranging concepts including:


  *   Career development;

  *   Whether to set up their own business;

  *   Motivating their teams to achieve goals and targets;

  *   Raising their own children; and

  *   Seeking to understand the perspectives of others.


  In a growing globalization and diversification of the workforce, the ability
  to step back and see the big picture is increasingly important for individuals
  to sustain both their own growth and development, as well as success at work
  in being able to work and communicate effectively with others who come from a
  wide range of backgrounds.

  ### Embrace the future and those who can describe it


  > "When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into
  a huge brain… We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly,
  irrespective of distance… A man will be able to carry one \[telephone\] in his
  vest pocket."- Nikola Tesla, writing in 1926, quoted in NeuroTribes, page 230


  Many of the people Silberman writes about were considered helpless and no good
  to society because they didn’t fit the normal societal expectations. Yet, many
  of them have knowledge and skills beyond the average person. Isn’t accepting
  those we consider to be “eccentric” or “out there” also a way in which we can
  welcome and spread true diversity in the workforce? I can only imagine how
  “strange” this vision of Tesla’s was at the time, yet there was a whole
  community connected by the entrepreneur Hugo Gernsback through his issues of
  Modern Electrics. Silberman identifies this as one method for autistic
  individuals to connect with and find like-minded people to discuss and share
  ideas with one another. The value of creating communities where autistic
  people (and their relatives) could meet, share their views, and not be
  ignored, was instrumental in shifting some of the accepted nature of what it
  meant to be autistic. Today, in organizations and across professions we
  commonly bring people together in similar ways, such as communities of
  practice and professional associations. Humans need to be able to connect with
  each other and today we have a much greater opportunity for doing so with the
  internet and other communication methods, ironically some of these being built
  by individuals now believed to be on the autism spectrum.

  many organizations seek to increase the levels of empowerment as it is
  considered a critical component in increasing staff engagement at work. This
  is important as there is increasing evidence that having an engaged workforce
  helps a company establish and maintain competitive advantage. In today’s
  economy and with the growth of knowledge workers, having staff who are truly
  engaged and committed to their employer’s success means that those companies
  are more likely to be competitive and sustainable into the future.
f_conclusion: >-
  Whilst this book was not what I had assumed, it gave me a fabulous insight
  into how the study and understanding of autism has changed over time. It has
  also made me rethink those I know who I have considered eccentric, perhaps
  they are just ahead of their time, much like the entrepreneur Gernsback, who
  was born in 1884 and installed an intercom system in a local convent 13 years
  later. Gernsback would admonish his cousin Hildegaard on the telephone telling
  her “Fix your hair. It won’t be long before the caller can see your face over
  the wires.”

> "We need all hands on deck to right the ship of humanity." _\- Zosia Zaks, quoted in NeuroTribes, page 469_

I must admit, I selected _NeuroTribes_ based on its title, assuming it would shed light on how people congregate in the workplace and how this might challenge the establishment of diverse teams. How I got this impression I am not sure some six months after adding it to my list of books that I wanted to write a summary for on behalf of Actionable Books. I was clearly mistaken, and it took me a couple of chapters to realize the depth of my mistake by not reading the book’s synopsis closely.

Having said that, Steve Silberman has written an extremely interesting and enlightening book about autism, its history, and how our thinking has changed about this condition. Once I was over the shock of my error, I found this book to provide much food for thought about how we can think differently about peers and colleagues as well as the importance of challenging well established norms and expectations. Indeed, our ability to challenge this can be seen throughout our evolution, an example that springs to mind is the long-held belief that the world was spherical, although it wasn’t proved until the 1400s and debate continued until that point.

Silberman has produced a wonderfully descriptive history of autism and I couldn’t help but sympathize with those who put their egos ahead of their patients. I was also inspired by the courage of those who decided to challenge the sometimes sacrosanct medical knowledge given their own very personal experiences and faith in their own skills to bring out the best in their children. As a management coach and someone who works on supporting the transformation and growth of individuals and organizations, this book had many themes which are equally important in my field of work and it was a book well worth reading.
