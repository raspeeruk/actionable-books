  ### A great story changes everything


  > "Our sales story is our most important and most frequently used weapon. When
  we have a great story, it changes everything."- New Sales. Simplified, page
  105


  Having a great story can completely change the way that you communicate with
  your prospects and give you confidence about the product or service that you
  offer. A great story isn’t one where you take the prospect through all the
  details of how your company was founded, or necessarily give people the “warm
  and fuzzy” feeling of why they should buy from you – it’s shouldn’t be fluff.
  A great story is one that is focused on the prospect, the issues you can solve
  for them, and why you’re different from the existing solution they’re using.
  Weinberg breaks down a great story into three components:


  1.  Client Issues Addressed

  2.  Offerings

  3.  Differentiators


  The more powerful and relevant the story is to your prospect, the more
  confident you will feel. The biggest mistake salespeople make when telling
  prospects about their company is when they start with what they do. They begin
  with “we make…” or “we provide…” but none of these explanations are going to
  go anywhere because a prospect is only going to think “So what? What does that
  do for me?” And that’s why you need to create a powerful story because from
  the first words until the last words that you share, it needs to connect with
  how you’re going to make a difference for that prospect.


  I spent an hour crafting my story and I already feel more comfortable and
  confident in approaching prospects. You can make it a bigger initiative across
  your team or company but a small investment in fine tuning your story can pay
  off handsomely the next time you speak to a prospect.

  ### Make the phone your best friend


  > "Bar none, the phone is still the most deadly and accurate weapon to score a
  face-to-face meeting with a target prospect."- New Sales. Simplified, page 69


  One of the challenges around new business development is the fear of making
  cold calls. Salespeople fear making them because they don’t know what to say
  and they also don’t want to sound like a telemarketer. It’s understandable
  because you’re contacting people without their solicitation. A salesperson’s
  mindset can really help or hinder this process. A great salesperson knows that
  proactive sales calling is not telemarketing. She knows that you’re calling
  the prospects for a great reason and will potentially be able to bring
  tremendous value to the company she is calling. This makes her much more
  valuable and she knows it.


  To further add confidence, the salesperson knows that she has a great story to
  tell. She has done homework into the client’s issues her company has helped
  resolve and what makes her different from the competition. She understands
  that if an issue doesn’t resonate with a prospect, she can always mention
  another issue that may hit the mark instead.


  Weinberg provides additional tactical tips like starting the call with “let me
  steal a minute” to make himself sound more human or saying that he “heads up
  \_\_\_\_\_” so people can put into perspective who you are.

  ### Select targets for a reason


  > "When charged with acquiring new business, the natural and essential first
  questions are: 'Where is the business going to come from?' and 'Who should I
  be pursuing?'. If we are putting together a prospecting and new business
  development sales attack, we need to know where to go and whom to target"- New
  Sales. Simplified, page 51


  Having a target list helps you narrow down the prospects you want to go after
  and ones that you think will have the best potential of converting into
  customers. Without a target list, you’ll likely end up like most other
  unfocused salespeople by going after the “hottest” accounts that likely
  changes every day.


  Here are some of the questions Weinberg suggests asking as you begin creating
  your target list: “Who are our best customers? What are their common
  characteristics? What do their businesses ‘look, smell, and feel’ like?”
  Starting by looking at your current customers is a great place to start “hot
  spotting” companies that “look, smell, and feel” a lot like your best clients.
  You may also want to dig a little bit deeper and find out if there are certain
  industries and sub-sectors that many of your customers come from.


  “It’s imperative that the salesperson builds a _strategic, finite, focused,
  written,_ and _workable_ list of target referral sources”. A _workable_ list
  is very important. Salespeople have a variety of responsibilities and if they
  have a limited time available to every week, a list of hundreds of prospects
  may not be feasible. Having a workable list also allows one to reexamine the
  effectiveness of the target list. After a month of prospecting into target
  accounts with no traction, there may be some issues with the targets
  themselves and it may be worth re-evaluating the accounts that were chosen.
f_conclusion: >-
  Mike Weinberg’s _New Sales. Simplified_ is the most important book on business
  development I have read thus far. I was really impressed at how direct and
  practical Weinberg was with each of the key topics, which was very refreshing.
  I also appreciated the step-by-step approach that he takes you through to
  build your story or create your strategic target list.

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### A great story changes everything

Having a great story can completely change the way that you communicate with your prospects and give you confidence about the product or service that you offer.

It’s so hard to find good books on new business development because it’s a difficult skill to master. But add this to your list if you’re looking to make more sales, especially with new clients. I have a feeling you’ll be re-reading it quite a bit after you pick it up.
