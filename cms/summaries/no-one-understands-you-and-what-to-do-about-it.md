  ### We’re Often Misunderstood


  > "Without realizing it, you—like everyone else—are very likely operating
  under two very flawed assumptions: first, that other people see you
  objectively as you are, and, second that other people see you as you see
  yourself."- No One Understands You and What to Do About It, page 10


  Halvorson’s claim is that it’s hard to be judged accurately—that we’re not
  open books—even when we think we are. We don’t communicate as clearly as we
  think we do either verbally or non-verbally. This is true, even with the
  people who know us well. At the same time, the research tells us that being
  “judge-able”— allowing others to see us fully leads to more happiness and
  better adjustment.


  By cataloguing a myriad of cognitive biases that influence what we see, the
  fact that we are often misunderstood starts to make sense. We’re wired to make
  quick judgments—because of both the evolutionary benefits (that no longer hold
  so well in a modern world) of those judgments and the fact that slowing down
  and making more measured assessments requires more energy—and we default to
  using less energy.


  Because we’re most often unaware that our biases are coming into play, our
  misunderstandings are unconscious—meaning that we believe we are right in our
  assessments when we can be absolutely wrong. To see more clearly—and
  accurately—requires slowing down and making more effort—hard cognitive work.


  Halvorson makes suggestions for managing the biases with which we are
  perceived and most of them have to do with being more intentional in our
  communications and not assuming that others see us the way we wish to be seen.
  And, perhaps the most powerful tool we have for managing bias is understanding
  it.

  ### The Trust Lens


  > "The very first thing another person will seek to determine about you is
  whether he or she can trust you—in broad strokes, whether you are friend or
  foe."- No One Understands You and What to Do About It, page 84


  Halvorson suggests three major lenses of perception that shape the way that we
  are seen: trust, power and ego. Trust comes first (see above). Then, the power
  lens looks to answer the question “how much influence do you have over me?”
  and the ego lens asks “do you make me feel insecure?” I recommend looking at
  all the lenses—and I’ll focus on the trust lens here.


  Research demonstrates that we make automatic assessments of people on two key
  dimensions—warmth and competence. Warmth tells us whether someone’s intentions
  are good and competence tell us whether we believe they can act on these
  intentions. Again, this lens stems from a time when threats were
  existential—today they operate at a more psychological level.


  Research tells us that the answer to “which is more important” is “both.” And,
  it also tells us, somewhat surprisingly, that starting with warmth is best.
  This awareness is critical (and sometimes challenging) for organizational
  leaders.


  Strategies for increasing warmth include paying attention, showing empathy and
  trusting them first. To increase competence, one of the most powerful tools is
  eye contact.


  Getting the balance between warmth and competence right can be a challenge.
  Halvorson suggests that we can be perceived as warm AND competent by
  projecting strong character, being fair and honest—which is available to
  people not “warm” by nature.

  ### We Are All Cognitive Misers


  > "Human thought, like every other complex process, is subject to the
  speed-versus-accuracy trade-off. Go fast, and you make mistakes. Be thorough
  and diligent, and you take an eternity… Most of the time, just the gist will
  do, so we choose speed."- No One Understands You and What to Do About It, page
  21


  Being a cognitive miser means that we use a slew of “shortcuts” to make quick
  assessments of others based on a variety of heuristics (rules of thumb) and
  assumptions. There are too many of these at play to cover, so I’ll mention a
  couple of the big ones.


  The most common assumption that guides perception is that when people look at
  you, they see what they expect to see. This is called _confirmation bias_. If
  the perceiver expects you to be dishonest, whatever you say or do will be
  filtered through that lens and will fit that perception. Similarly, if they
  perceive you trustworthy. These expectations are based on, among other
  things—stereotypes, first impressions (often too hastily made) or seeing you
  as being like someone else the perceiver knows.


  Other biases, such as our tendency to assume good intentions for ourselves but
  not for others, only increases the challenge we have in helping others see us
  more clearly.


  One thing that can help us to overcome this and other biases is to recognize
  our own tendency to think that others see and feel what we see and feel. The
  more we recognize that this is not true, the more intentional we can become
  about the impressions we make—and the less we will assume that others see and
  experience what we see and experience. We will also work harder and more
  diligently than we thought necessary to correct mistaken impressions.
f_conclusion: >-
  One of the conclusions I draw from this book and others I’ve been reading
  about cognitive bias is that while we benefit from knowing about bias, we will
  never be immune. We will continue to make biased assessments and to be judged
  based on others’ biases. That’s how our minds work. I’m also convinced that
  just knowing how deeply these biases operate helps us in our assessments of
  others and in the way we manage ourselves.

  "The uncomfortable truth is that most of us don’t come across the way we
  intend. We can’t see ourselves truly objectively, and neither can anyone else.
  Human beings have a strong tendency to distort other people’s feedback to fit
  their own views. We know this intellectually, and yet we rarely seem to
  recognize it as it’s happening."

Heidi Grant Halvorson is a social psychologist, researcher and an entertaining writer. Her first book, [_Succeed_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/succeed-how-we-can-reach-our-goals/), is a favorite of mine. She offers fresh, counter-intuitive, thought and action provoking insights into the science of goal attainment.

While _No One Understands You and What to Do About It_ doesn’t rise to the level of _Succeed_, there are plenty of gems in it as well—and Halvorson is masterful at bringing research and studies to bear in an engaging and often amusing way.

Halvorson’s intent, here, is to help us understand why the way we’re seen by others is often distorted—and how we can be seen the way we want to be seen. Admittedly, one of the challenges that Halvorson addresses is that we don’t see ourselves all that clearly either. Recognizing this is central to the challenge we face.

While much of the research Halvorson shares isn’t new (Kahneman’s [_Thinking Fast and Slow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/) is oft-quoted), her way of organizing and framing it is helpful. And, I’m finding this book most useful in helping me to recognize when my assessments of others are biased—becoming more aware of my actual and potential biases and thereby making more empathetic and fairer assessments of others.
