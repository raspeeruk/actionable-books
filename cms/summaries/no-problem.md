  ### What’s My Problem?


  > "When we are able to distinguish between problems, we can make better
  choices about how to respond."- No Problem, page xxi


  When planning a trip, the first step in deciding which route to take is
  knowing where you ultimately want to end up. Likewise, we need to be able to
  clearly express our problems if we expect to resolve them adequately. Try
  framing your question with the words “How to…” at the beginning, as in: “My
  problem is how to get the last of my Christmas shopping done before the 24th”.


  Stress, emotional baggage, looming deadlines and other outside influences can
  often cloud our judgment and over-complicate issues. Putting your challenge
  into words (and writing them down) can remove or reduce some of the irrational
  emotion that you have attached to it in your head.


  Once you’ve identified the real problem you’re facing, you can much more
  easily categorize it as a decision, a problem or a dilemma. As a general rule
  of thumb, decisions simply need to be made, problems need to be explored
  further to “discover” new solutions, and dilemmas need to be managed.


  If you find that rewording a challenge as “How to” is proving to be a
  challenge, here’s a couple tips on other ways to find the root of your issue…

  ### Separation Anxiety


  > "THE BIGGEST enemies of problem solving are ignorance and fear. They are a
  formidable duo; fear prevents learning that might eliminate ignorance, and
  ignorance reinforces the fear."- No Problem, page 115


  Here’s the weird thing about problems: sometimes we have become so used to
  having them as a part of our lives that we resist when there’s an opportunity
  to be rid of them. It sounds bizarre, but it’s true – some people who have
  always had money issues continue to take action (or lack of action) that keeps
  them poor. Be honest with yourself – do you want this problem to go away? Of
  course our first reaction is to say “Yes! Obviously I want this problem out of
  my life!” Are you sure?


  One great indicator that you’re not yet ready to let go of the problem is
  whining. Do you know anyone like that? Someone you’re not sure would have
  anything to talk about if they weren’t venting about their problems? Are you
  one of those people? No, of course not. But most of us do it to some extent
  from time to time – we whine about our problems, almost bragging about them
  like a badge of honour. Next time you find yourself whining about your
  problems for no reason other than attention, ask yourself if you’re ready to
  let go of them yet.

  ### The Miracle Question


  > "...imagine through some miracle that your problem was completely
  eliminated. What would be the first thing you would notice?"- No Problem, page
  56


  _“If the sky opened and the perfect solution dropped into your lap, what would
  it look like?”_ As you describe your answer, pay attention to the words you
  use. Better still, have someone write down your description or create an audio
  recording of it. The key elements of your ideal solution can often be great
  indicators of the real problem you’re working to resolve.


  Imagine you’re wrestling with your job. Your problem might initially seem to
  be something like, “I’m unhappy with my current job.” If you run it through
  the miracle question, though, you may start to realize your ideal solution
  comes out like, “I want a fast paced work environment where I can see the
  tangible difference I’m making in the world. I want to be learning constantly,
  while giving back regularly.” Some of your key criteria include: ast paced,
  making a difference, growth, education. So now your problem may have morphed
  into, _“How do I find a job with a socially responsible company that will
  allow me to grow in a fast paced environment?”_


  Suddenly, you have a very different problem. The best part is that this one is
  actionable.

  It’s perhaps a credit and a criticism to Lowy to say that _No Problem_
  contains far, far too much content to retain in one reading. What we’ve
  covered here is the very tip of the iceberg. _No Problem_ goes into
  exceptional detail on how to address each of the three types of challenges,
  pitfalls to watch for, and sign posts to use in your pursuit of a solution.
  And yet, despite all the direction and suggestion within its pages, Lowy
  reminds us that nothing will help if you’re not willing to help yourself. If
  you’re content to whine about your problems, that’s fine – just understand
  that solutions come from deliberate action, not passive complaining. If you
  ARE looking for a solution, and a guide to get you there, _No Problem_ is a
  resource worth having.

_No Problem_ is about understanding, simplifying and resolving three fundamentally different categories of problem. Lowy defines those three as:

**Decisions** – The task of deciding on one solution from an existing set of options.  
**Problems** – A puzzle that is missing a piece required to find a suitable solution.  
**Dilemmas** – The challenge of understanding two or more conflicting influences on a situation, and how they can be better understood or exploited.

If you’ve ever been to a hospital emergency waiting area, you’re well aware of the fact that the ER is one place where “first come, first served” is NOT company policy. The Triage station in a hospital exists to assess incoming situations – the severity, the urgency and the unique needs of each admitting patient. Hospitals get it. For a variety of reasons, different cases require different treatments.

Just like hospital patients, not all problems in your life are created equal. Lowy uses the criteria of complexity and uncertainty as the two major variables in assessing your challenge. Effectively, as the details of a situation become more complex, and as the outcome of potential strategies becomes more uncertain, your challenge will change in definition from **decision** to **problem** to **dilemma**.

_No Problem_ offers a startling array of tools and exercises for each of the three problem types. Before any of those tools can be put into place, though, there is a fundamental question that must be answered…
