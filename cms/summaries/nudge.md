  ### Be a choice architect


  > "A choice architect has the responsibility for organizing the context in
  which people make decisions. If you design the form that new employees fill
  out to enroll in the company health care plan, you are a choice architect. If
  you are a parent, describing possible educational options to your son or
  daughter, you are a choice architect."- Nudge, page 3


  Why is the “add to cart” button located on the right side of Amazon’s page
  instead of the left? Why do some ATMs wait to dispense your money until after
  you have removed your card? A choice architect or a group of choice architects
  decided that for one reason or another that the right side of the screen was
  preferable to the left and that maybe ATM patrons would be less likely to
  leave their card if they were required to perform an additional action. A
  choice architect forms the situation where people make a decision and makes a
  judgment call about that decision. Depending upon how well that architect
  does, the result could resemble something as baffling as filing your taxes or
  as simple as buying a book with a single click on Amazon.


  A choice architect understands that decisions must be made and utilizes
  discreet means to help those making the decision better their lives. So
  remember, whether you are sending around a signup sheet for the holiday
  potluck or presenting a retirement plan to incoming employees, how you frame
  the choice matters.

  ### Improve the default


  > "…setting default options, and other similar seemingly trivial menu-changing
  strategies, can have huge effects on outcomes."- Nudge, page 8


  Making decisions can be a taxing process. Think about how easy it is to listen
  to the radio compared to having to select each song and build a playlist.
  Often the default settings are never changed because it takes time to make
  good decisions.


  The authors explain that due to the “status quo bias”, people often leave
  default settings in place. How many papers did you write in college penned in
  Times New Roman, or how often do you pay for a monthly gym membership you
  never use? Default options have staying power because when a decision has been
  made you can move onto something else.


  Default options can help with more than just seemingly small impact decisions.
  Often default nudges exist to help you make better decisions ahead of time so
  you don’t have to remember to do so in the moment, such as an automatic
  deduction for a savings account or a sleep timer on the TV so you can get to
  bed on time.

  ### Nudge


  > "To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid.
  Nudges are not mandates. Putting the fruit at eye level counts as a nudge.
  Banning junk food does not."- Nudge, page 6


  Choice architects employ nudges to improve decision making. The authors
  describe a nudge as something “that alters people’s behavior in a predictable
  way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic
  incentives.” An example of a nudge would be a cafeteria that replaces its
  regular garbage cans with a three compartment container saying: recycling,
  compostables, and landfill. Nudges are subtle suggestions and do not remove
  someone’s ability to choose. With the cafeteria, someone may still choose not
  to recycle. A nudge can be something as simple as removing the trays from
  cafeterias to help reduce the amount of food someone eats because it is more
  cumbersome to transport it to a table.
f_conclusion: >-
  After reading _Nudge_ I tried to find ways to improve my decisions through
  small unobtrusive means. I relocated select files and office supplies near my
  desk to the other side of the room, twenty feet away. Now when I need a paper
  clip I have to get up and move from my desk. This nudge helps me get in a few
  more steps/activity during the day and keeps my desk uncluttered. Win, win.

  …small and apparently insignificant details can have major impacts on people’s
  behavior. A good rule of thumb is to assume that ‘everything matters.’ In many
  cases, the power of these small details comes from focusing the attention of
  users in a particular direction.

You make thousands of decisions a day. More importantly, these choices do not occur in a vacuum. It is impossible to not be influenced when making these decisions. When you order lunch off a menu or select a color of paint at the hardware store someone has spent a lot of time subtly helping you make a decision one way or another. Before you become too alarmed about evil marketers with ulterior motives, Professors Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, authors of _Nudge_, believe that you can use this knowledge to your advantage. They call anyone who has influence over decisions a choice architect.

I have tried to improve some of my default decisions. By purchasing bell peppers and hummus from the grocery store instead of ice cream when I want a snack I am, by default, making better choices because I made the default a better option.
