  ### Create an OASIS


  > "What if you could turn the desert of miscommunication that exists between
  you and others into an oasis where you can meet and have a refreshing
  conversation—one that allows you each to understand where the other is coming
  from so you can develop empathy and insight and reach mutually beneficial
  agreements?"- OASIS Conversations, page 12


  OASIS is an acronym for a series of steps to take to ensure positive and
  productive conversations:


  O – Observation: Think about the observable data, divorced from your thoughts
  or feelings.


  A – Awareness: Be aware of the assumptions, emotions, and biases that
  influence your perception of the situation.


  S – Shift (to being open): When you become aware of the implicit judgments you
  are making, make a concerted shift toward curiosity about the other person’s
  perspective.


  I – Importance: Now that you are communicating from a position of openness,
  focus the conversation on what is important to you and the people you are
  communicating with.


  S – Solution: Based on what is important to all parties involved, explore and
  agree on possible solutions.


  One of the strengths of this framework is the focus on personal
  accountability. Having meaningful conversations is a choice, and there are
  clear, easy to follow steps to creating them. It’s a great reminder to examine
  the assumptions and biases behind emotional reactions, and to remember that
  there is likely a lot going on that you don’t know about. Van Eron discusses
  each step of the process in depth, and makes it easy to implement her process.
  Even at a high level, remembering to approach difficult conversations from an
  open perspective can quickly yield results.

  ### Take a Welcoming Stance—Be Curious


  > "It is useful to remember: “We don’t know what we don’t know.” This will
  engage our curiosity."- OASIS Conversations, page 205


  Van Eron lists five stances or moods that can help to create an open,
  non-judgmental mindset. They are:


  *   Courageous (open-gutted)

  *   Compassionate (open-hearted)

  *   Curious (open-minded)

  *   Appreciative of “what is” and “what is unfolding”

  *   Optimistic about what is possible.


  In applying to your own communication style, think about the areas of your
  life where these perspectives will help you to have more valuable
  conversations.


  For me, a lot of this introspection came back to curiosity and
  open-mindedness, and how much of our innate curiosity is programmed out of us
  at school, and early in our work experience. I am a very inquisitive person by
  nature, and I can remember countless examples from my early education when I
  was encouraged (either implicitly or explicitly) to just stop with the
  questions already and do the assignment. But a curious stance is an open
  stance. When you are hungry to know more, to understand better, to fill in the
  blanks, you are not judging.


  Van Eron suggests that we make a conscious effort to begin questions with the
  words “I’m curious” to develop the practice of curiosity. Starting a question
  this way signals to the other person that you’re not coming from a place of
  judgment, you just really want to know more about what they think. This
  signals respect and trust, and creates space for more meaningful
  conversations. It’s a simple but powerful action that you can take today.

  ### Intent Does Not Equal Impact


  > "Most of us view a person’s behavior, attribute a motive to it, and more
  often than not, tend to assume negative intent. Just the awareness of a
  person’s positive intent can change the way we respond to that person."- OASIS
  Conversations, page 21


  Great conversations can’t happen without a degree of trust and respect. We are
  physiologically wired to be constantly scanning for threats. When we sense
  danger, we shut down, bristle, and go on the defensive. It’s difficult to have
  open and honest conversations when this happens.


  At one of my first jobs, I worked for a manager who sent notoriously short
  emails–three half sentences if you were lucky. About three weeks after I
  started, I was out for drinks with a co-worker (hired at the same time/level
  as me), and she confessed that she thought our boss hated her. She was feeling
  insecure in her new role, and interpreted those short, stream of conscious
  emails as chastising, or some sort of coded indicator of her poor performance.


  Really, that manager was just trying to loop us in on her thinking, so that we
  could learn from her. Her intent was to help us progress in our careers, to
  understand elements of the business more fully, and to invite us to pitch her
  ideas. Once we were able to talk through our manager’s intent, those curt
  emails no longer felt like a slight, and we were both able to learn a great
  deal.


  I think it’s important to note that my co-worker’s response was emotional. We
  were three weeks into new and challenging roles, so of course she was feeling
  overwhelmed and perhaps a bit vulnerable. Those emotions manifested in an
  assumption that turned out to be incorrect. The simple act of becoming aware
  of that assumption (instead of just feeling it emotionally), allowed us to
  talk through the situation from a new perspective, and reframe our
  conversations for the better.
f_conclusion: >-
  This is a fantastic book for anyone who wants to improve the quality of their
  conversations. It’s geared toward the workplace, but there are certainly
  applications for personal relationships as well. By following the five steps
  in the OASIS process that Van Eron lays out, you can learn to recognize your
  own judgments, adopt an open-minded stance, and create practical solutions for
  problems you are facing. Thinking about these steps in relation to difficult
  conversations I’ve had recently in my personal life has already yielded some
  great results, and helped me to adopt a more open-mindset.

  “A lot of energy is wasted because we misunderstand each other, make
  uninformed judgments, and have difficulty coming to agreements—causing both
  relationships and results to suffer. For most of us, communicating with others
  is one of the most challenging aspects of our professional and personal
  lives.”

> “A lot of energy is wasted because we misunderstand each other, make uninformed judgments, and have difficulty coming to agreements—causing both relationships and results to suffer. For most of us, communicating with others is one of the most challenging aspects of our professional and personal lives.” _\- OASIS Conversations, page 2_

The data is clear: employee engagement is directly related to the relationships that people have with both their managers and their peers. Relationships are built through conversations. Ann Van Eron has outlined a simple, easy to follow process for improving personal relationships through more open conversations in her new book OASIS Conversations: Leading with an Open Mindset to Maximize Potential.

What I really like about this book is it’s focus on personal accountability and openness. We often make snap-judgments about others, and carry around unconscious biases and assumptions that can damage our relationships. By following the steps outlined in Van Eron’s book, we can all learn to challenge those assumptions, have more open conversations, and build more productive relationships.
