  ### Hit Your Purpose


  > "Your destiny is a moving target, and that’s why I prefer to use the word
  purpose or, as you’ve seen, your One Big Thing."- One Big Thing, page 10


  There are those people who seem to be born knowing exactly what their purpose
  in life is. And then there’s the rest of us. We struggle to find that One Big
  Thing that excites us, that we wake up energized and raring to do. This isn’t
  just the concern of the recent graduate, or that loser friend that can never
  seem to get his act together. This can be the CEO who was thrust into a role
  that wasn’t really for her. That doesn’t mean she’s not good at what she does.
  Indeed she could very well be great, but it’s not her One Big Thing, and it’s
  not her passion.


  It’s never too late to discover your One Big Thing, that niche that you could
  command like no one else. The following two Insights will help you to identify
  your purpose, and what to do if what you thought was your purpose doesn’t
  really work out.

  ### Know When To Move On


  > "A Picasso always looks like Picasso painted it. Hemingway always sounds
  like Hemingway. A Beethoven symphony always sounds like a Beethoven symphony.
  Part of being a master is learning how to sing in nobody else’s voice but your
  own."- Hugh MacLeod quoted in One Big Thing, page 87


  You’ve focused on the niche that you thought you could conquer, but it hasn’t
  quite worked out, so what do you do? You graciously move on.


  To illustrate this point, Cooke uses George Lang, a man who desperately wanted
  to become a violinist, as an example. He dutifully practiced, but when he
  heard Jascha Heifetz perform the violin in concert, he knew he would never be
  as good. So he decided to be “the Heifetz of something else.” And he did. He
  ascended the heights of the restaurant industry, eventually owning New York
  City’s famed Café des Artists and lending his expertise as a food critic and
  correspondent for CBS News. The violin wasn’t for him, but food and
  restaurants were.


  “I loved Lang’s brutal honesty in that interview,” Cooke writes. “His
  realization that he would most likely never achieve his original dream didn’t
  cause him to give up, grow bitter, or live in a delusion. He had the courage
  to face his limitations with brutal honesty and his clarity of vision enabled
  him to become just as influential in another area.”


  Know when it’s time to move on. Recognize that you’ve plateaued, that you
  won’t get any better. It’s more admirable to move on than to be second best.

  > "What have you done that made people notice? What brings you affirmation,
  encouragement, and compliments from friends and coworkers?"- One Big Thing,
  page 92


  Sometimes the people around you, whether it’s a co-worker, a friend, or a
  family member, can see the path that you should be on more clearly than you
  can. This is something I know to be true. In university I was struggling with
  which direction I wanted to go. I had begun school with the intention of
  majoring in psychology, but I quickly learned that that discipline wasn’t for
  me. I sort of sat in limbo for a time, just taking classes that appealed to
  me. When I discussed this separately with two friends, they both told me that
  I should major in English. They pointed out that I seemed to flourish in
  English courses, and had a natural aptitude for it. How come they could see
  this so clearly, while I agonized over my decision? I’m not sure, but I’m glad
  they did!


  But Cooke also asks that you consider the “credentials” before jumping in with
  both feet. “My advice is to weigh any outside influence in the balance of who
  and how qualified they are. While your writing teacher, business mentor, or
  experienced friend should be listened to and their advice acted on, keep in
  mind that coworkers and family members sometimes operate out of jealousy or
  ignorance. When your writing teacher recommends you keep the day job until you
  improve your writing, that’s worth listening to. But when your neighbor
  criticizes your decision because she thinks you need a ‘real’ job, then keep
  moving forward.”


  What do people tell you that you do better than anyone else? Perhaps that will
  put you on the right path to finding your One Big Thing!

  Finding your purpose, or as Phil Cooke calls it, your One Big Thing, can be
  one of the most challenging things you will ever do, but once you’ve located
  it, it can be the most rewarding things you can ever accomplish. _One Big
  Thing: Discovering What You Were Born To Do_ won’t give you all of the
  answers—_you’ve_ got to put in the work—but it will help to start a discourse
  within yourself and put you on the right path…

  accomplishing?"

Phil Cooke, author of _One Big Thing: Discovering What You Were Born To Do_, has had an interesting and unique career, “From producing media programming in more than forty countries to directing prime-time television, being a business partner in a production company that produced Super Bowl commercials, to advising nonprofit and humanitarian organizations around the world, to being one of the few working producers in Hollywood with a PhD.” He’s located his One Big Thing, his driving purpose in life, and he’s here to help you find yours. The way he sees it, there are two big questions when it comes to discovering your One Big Thing:

1.  _What am I supposed to do with my life?_
2.  _How do I get noticed?_

Cooke says that the “intersection of those two questions is what this book is about.”

But don’t expect to be spoon fed the answers. Cooke acknowledges that if you’re looking for a quick fix, or “five easy steps” to locating your purpose, this is the wrong book for you. “This book won’t give you all the answers, but it will help you start asking the right questions.”

Let’s get to asking some of those questions, shall we?
