  ### Those Who Feel Good, Do Good


  > "People Who Feel Good About Themselves Produce Good Results."- The One
  Minute Manager, page 19


  One common tie between the One Minute Goal Setting, Praising and Reprimand, is
  the underlying sense of respect and inherent worth that is maintained (and
  shared) with the individual on the receiving end.


  Goal setting is conducted together, with the manager valuing the insight from
  the employee. Up front, responsibilities and consequences are established and
  discussed until both parties understand their personal responsibilities. They
  get to feel a sense of ownership and know that they are trusted. The One
  Minute Praising is powerful because it’s specific and immediate. And the One
  Minute Reprimand reminds the employee that it’s the action that’s being
  criticized, not the person.


  _“He looks you straight in the eye and tells you precisely what you did
  right.  

  Then he shares with you how good he feels about what you did.”_


  Regardless of the relationship, and whether you’re in a senior role or are on
  a level playing field, keep one fact in mind; People want one thing – to feel
  valued.

  ### The Nature of Complaint


  > "If you can’t tell me what you’d like to be happening, he said, you don’t
  have a problem yet. You’re just complaining. A problem only exists if there is
  a difference between what is actually happening and what you desire to be
  happening."- The One Minute Manager, page 31


  I think this is one of my favorite quotes from any book in the last 12 months.
  I think it’s a great rule of thumb for discussion with anyone – if you can’t
  identify what you’d like to see happen, then don’t waste time talking about
  “problems”. A problem has a solution; maybe not a readily available one, and
  certainly not always an easy one. But the possibility is there. Don’t tell
  someone what they’re doing wrong until you can identify what it is they should
  be doing right. You’ll save yourself, and them, a lot of time, energy and
  grief.

  ### Feedback is the Breakfast of Champions


  > "Most managers wait until their people do something exactly right before
  they praise them. As a result, many people never get to become high performers
  because their managers concentrate on catching them doing things wrong – that
  is, anything that falls short of the final desired performance."- The One
  Minute Manager, page 82


  What is true of most managers, can easily be true of most parents, spouses or
  friends. Try catching someone doing something right. Let them know what it
  means that they did it to such great quality, and how it makes you feel. No
  one will ever fault you for giving a deserved compliment.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The One Minute Manager_ is a simple message, wrapped in an extremely
  enjoyable read. The profound truth to the three messages in the book are so
  simply explained, they can be picked up and adopted by any one at any stage of
  life. Possibly the most important thought though, buried near the end of the
  book is this: _“As he looked back, he was glad he had not waited to use One
  Minute Management until he thought he could do it just right.”_

Despite the title, _The One Minute Manager_ is not a book simply for managers. Certainly, it has brilliant strategy on how to effectively (and efficiently) work with employees. However, the reason for this book’s tremendous global success is the universally applicable nature of the message. This is a book for managers and employees, parents with children, co-workers, housemates, classmates and married couples. And I mean that quite sincerely. So the question is –

**What universal truths resonate in all human interaction?**

The story of _The One Minute Manager_ is told as a fable, as are many of Ken Blanchard’s books. In it, we are introduced to a young “manager in training”; a man on a quest to discover the makings of an ideal manager. He finds managers who are “hard liners” – dedicated to bottom line gain, usually at the expense of employee morale. He finds “soft” managers – those who get their greatest satisfaction from the happiness of their staff, although often at the expense of the company’s financial well being. And then, the young man comes across a different kind of manager – a manager who produces some of the best results in his field, while maintaining an extremely positive work environment and appears to have more free time than any of his counterparts.

In a nutshell, here are the three tools the one minute manager uses to maintain a positive, productive organization:

**1\. One Minute Goal Setting**: outlining, with the employee specific goals, benchmarks and consequences (good and bad)

**2\. One Minute Praisings**: Catching someone doing something right, and recognizing them for it.

**3\. One Minute Reprimands**: Catching unproductive or negative behavior immediately, and explaining to the employee what the consequences have been.

Those three points are an extremely condensed version of the three found in _The One Minute Manager_, and should not be utilized until further understood. (aka – if you’re a manager, buy and read this book. It’s 107 large font, small sheet pages – it’ll take you a couple hours, max.)

But for the rest of us, who are not managers, and have patiently read the last paragraph looking for the “universal truth” mentioned above… thank you for your patience. Here you go:
