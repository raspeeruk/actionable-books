  ### One Single Solitary Page


  > "…the method for defining one’s leadership philosophy is common to all
  leaders but the output of that process is as varied as the shapes of
  snowflakes."- One Piece of Paper, page 5


  Mike Figliuolo was a platoon leader in the army early in his career. He says
  he failed miserably when trying to convey the expectations he had of his
  soldiers. In hindsight, looking back at this failure, what he was saying to
  them “was full of jargon and devoid of meaning.” (pg. 10) After some
  consideration he told his unit to simply, “work hard and be honest.” (pg. 10)
  That stuck. It was simple and to the point, and explained to his soldiers what
  he valued as a leader and what he expected of them. Later he would tease out
  this idea into what has become the book _One Piece of Paper_. Any leader, no
  matter what field they’re in, can distill their philosophy onto “one single
  solitary page” as Figliuolo calls it.


  Dictionary.com defines a maxim as a “a principle or rule of conduct,” and in
  the context Figliuolo uses it, it is a single page outlining the expectations
  a leader has of their team’s work ethic and behaviours. A regular 8.5 by 11
  computer paper is all you need for effective communication of your maxim.


  Creating a maxim helps to ensure that you, as a leader, also maintain the
  standards that you expect of your team. I loved the analogy that Figliuolo
  uses about banning cookies from your diet. You’re more likely to stick to this
  incredibly difficult challenge if you tell others about your resolution
  because you have some accountability. A maxim works the same way. Not only
  will your team know what you expect of them, but what they can come to expect
  of you.

  ### Buzzkill


  > "After days or weeks of effort, we end up with a lengthy manifesto that
  articulates our leadership philosophy in terms worthy of inclusion in a Ph.D.
  program syllabus."- One Piece of Paper, page 17


  Have you ever read a lengthy leadership philosophy document that makes you
  wish there was a dictionary of corporate culture rhetoric to decipher what’s
  _actually_ being said? Chances are you have. Figliuolo dedicates an entire
  chapter to them in _One Piece of Paper_, which he opens with a fake maxim that
  is deliberately rife with buzzwords:


  “My leadership philosophy is to **optimally leverage** the passions of my
  people such that at the end of the day we maximize **employee engagement** to
  get them to think **outside the box** and **synergistically drive value-added
  activities** in a profit-maximizing way that is a **win-win** for our people,
  our shareholders, and our customers.” (pg 15)


  Perhaps they’re obvious to you, but if you’ve become so ingrained in corporate
  jargon that these words or phrases have become part of your daily rhetoric, I
  have taken the liberty of highlighting them in bold. These words are called
  “buzzwords,” and they can be problematic, especially when used in a maxim.


  Figluiolo calls this chapter a buzzword palate cleanser. You know, like taking
  a swig of water to remove the aftertaste before sipping the next wine at a
  tasting. When you employ these words and phrases, you are allowing the culture
  that comes along with them to mould your leadership, when it should be the
  other way around. They’re also emotionless, and make it seem as if you are
  trying to imitate another leader rather than establishing yourself as one in
  your own right. Your own personality should not take a backseat to corporate
  rhetoric, but rather should shape your maxim. But omitting these buzz-words
  also works twofold by making your maxim more accessible. It makes your
  position less confusing and removes the need for a translation to regular
  English. Keep it simple. Keep it real.

  ### Get Personal


  > "Your first few attempts at writing a maxim will probably be odd, because
  there is a good chance you are not used to accessing your emotions in a
  structured and focused way."- One Piece of Paper, page 8


  Creating a leadership maxim necessitates getting personal with both yourself
  and your team, allowing them to get to know the real you and what your core
  values are. As Figliuolo writes, this will work to humanize you in the eyes of
  your team. To clearly articulate your expectations of your team, you need to
  use the personal experiences that have shaped you into the leader you are in
  order to create a maxim that will stick with your team. He suggests keeping in
  mind the following when it comes to writing your maxim:


  *   Both positive and negative life experiences

  *   Favourite song lyrics

  *   Favourite sayings or quotes


  Basically anything that resonates with you is good maxim material. For many,
  this practice may come as a surprise. Traditionally leaders have been expected
  to appear stoic, but in today’s modern business world that just won’t cut it.
  The thought of creating a maxim that is personal might cause feelings of
  foreboding. That’s to be expected. We’re rarely expected to dig deep within
  ourselves and be so introspective, and then lay it all out there for others to
  see. It makes us feel naked, raw and vulnerable. But by doing so, there are so
  many rewards. You’re creating an atmosphere of trust. Figliuolo cautions that
  it might take several attempts to create a resonant maxim. Try writing several
  over the period a few weeks. When you read them back, you will realize that
  they might sound cold and impersonal, especially compared to your most recent
  attempts. You’ll see how far you’ve come. Even after you’ve come up with a
  maxim that you’re proud of, your maxim will continue to evolve as need be. But
  the hard part is over, and making necessary changes will be easy.
f_conclusion: >-
  Mike Figliuolo’s _One Piece of Paper_ is an invaluable resource for leaders
  both old and new. Creating your own maxim for the first time, or revising an
  existing one can be difficult, but Figliuolo holds your hand the entire way,
  and the questions he asks you to consider throughout the text (and his
  appendix) makes what can seem like a daunting task easier. With a little work,
  you can ensure that you and your entire team are all on the same page. (Pun
  intended.)

As a leader, communicating what you expect of your team and what they can expect of you can be both a difficult and intimidating process. When expectations aren’t communicated effectively, it can lead to confusion, lack of trust, an unmotivated team, differing interpretations of expectations, and a multitude of other negative outcomes. Mike Figliuolo, a leadership expert and Managing Director of thoughtLEADERS, LLC, has distilled what he has learned and imparted to other leaders about creating a leadership manifesto (in the form of a one page maxim) into _One Piece of Paper_, his first book. A 238 page book dedicated to one piece of paper might at first seem like overkill. But this “one single solitary page” might be the most important document you, as a leader, create.
