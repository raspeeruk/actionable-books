  ### Develop the habit of inquiry


  > "Most adults accept the world around them–from their career choices to their
  values and beliefs–as fate. At some point during adolescence, and without the
  slightest protest, many of us fall asleep as inquisitive children and wake as
  adults submitted to the hand that life has dealt. Perhaps we decide that we’re
  too busy for curiosity and discovery. Or perhaps we come to believe that
  asking questions won’t bear any fruit. We begin to see life as a treasure
  chest filled with answers but guarded by a daunting padlock. If only we would
  recognize that questions are the keys that unlock life’s greatest and most
  helpful answers."- One Question, page 185


  Coleman explains that questions accomplish several functions. Questions can
  reveal important things. “The right questions uncover truths we might not
  otherwise know.” Questions can get to the heart of a matter. Coleman compares
  questions to a surgeon’s scalpel saying that they cut through the surface
  information and help expose the real issues. Questions challenge the status
  quo and demand action.


  At the crux of the power of questions is curiosity. Enlist the who, what,
  when, where, why, and hows to challenge, to inquire, and to dig deeper for the
  sake of learning. Being curious and asking questions can produce insights that
  you may have come to accept as normal. For example, _have you ever thought
  about why the letters are arranged the way they are on a keyboard? Or what is
  the most efficient way to boil an egg?_


  So if questions are such great tools why isn’t everyone shouting their
  praises? **It takes effort to process something to a sufficient level that you
  have a good question to ask.** In a group setting asking questions can be the
  quickest way to be singled out for criticism.


  We need to be a lot more like children. Be curious. Don’t take things at face
  value. Ask more questions.

  ### Ask Ourselves


  > "Revealing, transformative answers to life’s most important questions surge
  with power. Their wisdom can shape us, improve us, and carry us through every
  stage of life. When we are beginning our journey to success, they will help us
  discover who we are and unearth the calling that only we can fulfill. When the
  storms of life rage, they will sustain us like a levee. And once we find
  success—in our professional lives, home lives, and spiritual voyages—those
  answers will ensure that we hang on tight and finish well."- One Question,
  Introduction


  Questions are powerful tools of discovery when we direct them at others, but
  **we can also learn a lot from asking ourselves questions.** Stopping and
  asking “Why am I doing what I’m doing?” or “Who do I want to become?” can lead
  us to self discovery and can trigger reflection or evaluation of one’s self.
  Carefully constructed questions provide a window to insights unparalleled by
  any other resource.


  Recently, my wife and I have made a habit of watching TED Talks in the evening
  and then discussing the different ideas and questions the talks present (a
  college professor once described TED Talks to me as “YouTube for smart
  people”). The result has been hours of conversations and questions about the
  material of the talks. More important than any one particular topic we’ve
  discussed is that we have started to ask ourselves more questions about where
  we are in life and habits we would like to change. These discussions have
  prompted us to take action and make changes in our lives that we may or may
  not have other wise implemented, but the questions were pivotal in the
  improvements.


  This experience has proven to me the power of questions and how much can be
  learned by asking questions of others. But I’ve also experienced how asking
  myself more questions leads to growth. I have a notebook where I write down
  questions that I come across. While some of the questions make me laugh as I
  review them, others make me pause and question, such as “Do my actions reflect
  my priorities?” Recording and then trying to answer questions has helped me to
  dissect past successes and failures and continue to grow. I’ve found that
  questions are empowering, they help to reduce vague problems into actionable
  solutions.

  ### Ask Others


  > "Occasionally, someone asks the right person the right question at the right
  time in the right way and magic happens: the person being interviewed moves
  beyond the mere facts to something deeper, something that flips a switch
  inside. The question produces an answer that inspires the interviewee,
  encourages him or makes him want to be a better person."- One Question,
  Introduction


  Questions can be employed to do more than satisfy a burgeoning curiosity and a
  repertoire for an appearance on _Jeopardy_. Questions can produce insights
  previously unseen or help us make unlikely connections. _Why are sales
  stagnant despite increased efforts in marketing? What is the best Thai
  restaurant in town? How do I start learning to build a web site?_


  I recently attended a presentation where the speaker explained that people
  invest a lot of time and effort into learning a skill or mastering a body of
  knowledge. She said that most of them are more than willing to share that
  information with others. There are a lot of smart people in the world. I’d
  even wager that you know a few that would be willing to spend some time with
  you to answer questions you may have whether that person be your boss, spouse,
  or an expert on Twitter.


  Coleman stresses that **you must ask the right question to the right person.**
  No matter how nice a financial analyst may be, she likely won’t be able to
  answer a question about conjugating French verbs for you.

  "Albert Einstein once said, 'To raise new questions, new possibilities, to
  regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks
  real advance in science. What is true of science, I’m convinced, is true in
  all of life. Great questions are often the keys that unlock possibilities for
  human advancement.'"

**Questions.** They are everywhere, aren’t they? We place a lot of emphasis on questions. There are even widely agreed upon ways of asking a question: the who, what, when, where, why, and how. In addition to providing several weeks worth of lessons to English teachers, questions have more profound implications.

Radio show host Ken Coleman believes that questions can serve as a catalyst for growth and development. Coleman has interviewed hundreds of business leaders, religious figures, and bestselling authors asking each of them one question. He took thirty six of their answers to some of life’s most difficult questions and turned them into the book _One Question_.

The author explains that the idea for the book arose when he asked a legendary basketball coach to explain what the coach meant about an idea in the coach’s book. Upon hearing the answer, Coleman explained, “Like a camera flash in a dark room, I suddenly realized the power of a single question. What had been a fairly mundane passage in this man’s book had now taken on new life.”

We are quizzical beings by nature. Just spend a few hours with a 5 year old and you’ll have living proof. Coleman encourages all of us to be more inquisitive and curious.

**While curiosity may have killed the cat, Coleman and those he interviews insist that satisfaction brought it back.**
