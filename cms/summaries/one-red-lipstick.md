  ### Live Your Dream


  > "I’d like to see ‘One Red Lipstick’ become a way of being, a catalyst for
  change. I want it to be a way of always being honest and authentic in our
  relationships, where we can be open and not hide from the struggles and
  embrace the pain that has happened to us."- One Red Lipstick, page 9


  Indeed, weaving beneath each tale is an inner strength borne of stopping at
  nothing to find one’s passion rather than allowing our music to die on the
  inside.


  A central point is how many of us are waiting to feel ready, waiting to feel
  good enough, waiting for the perfect moment to “magically arrive” before going
  after what we truly want. The problem is that perfect moment may never arrive.


  Every day, on some level, the entrepreneur is called upon to push through
  fears and release comfort zones. The reward is to arrive at places you never
  thought possible.

  ### Specific Advice


  > "We need to redefine success beyond money and power. We need to integrate
  well-being, wisdom and wonder."- Arianna Huffington, quoted in One Red
  Lipstick, page 49


  No one was asked to sugarcoat their insights. Rather, the aim is to share
  trials as well as triumphs involved in running one’s own business. The women
  in _One Red Lipstick_ made the choice to face their challenges head on.


  In the end, your business is a reflection of you. Those who dare to follow an
  entrepreneurial path need to be ready to play big and live even bigger.


  That’s why a primary goal of this igniting volume is to encourage women of all
  ages to consider entrepreneurship as an alternative to working for someone
  else. While admittedly not for everyone, we certainly can’t help but come away
  with renewed vim and vigor to follow our dreams!


  Editor Anne Day says it well: “We thank the women for sharing so freely and
  allowing themselves to be vulnerable and authentic.” I wholeheartedly agree!


  The depth of pain that some of these women have overcome speaks volumes about
  their courage, resiliency and just pure grit. Who could not be moved? I was.

  ### Common Themes


  > "It takes courage to run a business. Without it, I would not have been able
  to deal with the dragons around the corner or the challenges that came
  along."- One Red Lipstick, page 107


  As you read the fascinating stories, common threads can be located. Many of
  the women were propelled by parents who encouraged and fostered their
  entrepreneurial spirit. Many chose this path because life left them with few
  other choices. A number are from immigrant families or are immigrants
  themselves – having taken the risk to start afresh in a new country.


  The idea that we cannot always control what happens to us but we can control
  our reaction underpins their collective wisdom. Here are but a few
  representative examples:


  *   The key is to always keep redefining yourself.

  *   Let go of the fear that holds you back… Does it really deserve that much
  attention?

  *   Take it one step at a time. It is easy to get overwhelmed when you see the
  end goal but if you take little steps each day, it will be a lot more
  manageable.

  *   Don’t shrink to fit someone else’s definition of you.

  *   Keep moving forward and surround yourself with a group of people who
  support you and have your back.

  *   Right from the start, plan to be successful. If what you are doing fails,
  ride that failure like a gift, because it will take you somewhere. Accept it
  graciously and doors will open.

  *   Growing up, I gave in to those little voices that lived inside my head. I
  let them hold me back. We give those limiting beliefs power when we believe
  them to be true, but the truth is they’re not.

  *   If you’re not doing something that scares you every day, at least do
  something that stretches you.

> "You are our role models, our trail-blazers, and we salute and honor you." _\- One Red Lipstick, Welcome_

Twenty-something Spenser Chapple was on a quest to find women entrepreneurs who had been there and back. Yet, they remain successful in life and business. As a result, in her book _One Red Lipstick_, she has brought together 24 thought-provoking contributors from across North America. Each woman has an inspiring story to share. While the situations may vary, their essential message remains the same – dust yourself off, focus and live your best life.
