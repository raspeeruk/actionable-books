  ### The Most Important Number


  > "Success is not sustainable if it's defined by how big you become. Large
  numbers that once captivated me - 40,000 stores! - are not what matter. The
  only number that matters is "one". One cup. One customer. One partner. One
  experience at a time. We had to get back to what mattered most."- Onward, page
  156


  In 2007, Howard Shultz returned from retirement to once again sit atop the
  world’s most prominent coffee company. As Howard recounts, Starbucks had
  become a victim of its own success, focusing on growth for growth’s sake,
  rather than staying focused to the core values of celebrating coffee in a way
  that embraced its inherent social element.


  Regardless of the size of our businesses, the lesson from _Onward_ is
  applicable to us all: when our focus shifts from providing value (and growing
  as a result) to growing for growth’s sake, we make an almost invisible shift
  away from the soul of our business – a shift that can easily lead to
  capitulation and death.


  Now, more than ever, the customer is expecting a wonderful, personal
  experience when they interact with their product or service companies. When
  you start seeing them as “yet another transaction,” you disappoint that
  expectation; a disappointment that they likely won’t tolerate for long.

  ### Fixing Moments or Solving Problems?


  > "We are spending so much of our time fixing moments, but not actually
  solving problems. But fixing moments, like mopping a dirty floor, only
  provides short-term satisfaction. But take the time to understand the cause of
  the problem - like how to keep a floor from getting so dirty in the first
  place - solves, and maybe eliminates, a problem for the long run."- Kristen
  Driscoll, Starbucks Regional Director, as quoted in Onward, page 285


  At Starbucks, they call it “fixing moments”. I call them “putting out fires”.


  One of the biggest challenges facing Shultz upon his return to the ceo seat
  was to not plug the leaking holes, but to actually overhaul the boat so that
  the holes wouldn’t leak again. So often, we perceive ourselves as too time
  starved to really solve a problem. Sure, we slap a fix together and make the
  pain go away, but before we **properly** address the true nature of the
  problem, our time is demanded elsewhere and we’re off to battle another fire.


  Time is scarce. We get that. But something’s got to give. Being in a constant
  loop of putting out fires for 40 hours a week is exhausting and ultimately
  leads to burnout. **Truly solving a problem**, however is energizing. It’s
  inspiring, and it acts as a fresh start for new, innovative ideas to spring
  into being. The next time you find yourself “fixing a moment,” take a breath
  and think through how long it would take to actually solve the problem, once
  and for all. Especially when you think about how often you are putting out the
  same fire, solving the problem may actually _save you time,_ in the long run.
  It really comes down to **thinking**, rather than simply **responding**.

  ### Transcending Transaction


  > "Our partners' attitude and actions have such great potential to make our
  customers feel something."- Onward, page 117


  What do your customer interactions look like? Are you sharing a moment, or
  simply completing a transaction? When someone gives you money – be it $5 or
  $5000 – you have an opportunity for connection. That person has decided that
  something you offer is worth them parting with their hard earned dollars.
  You’ve already won the sale, but have you won the relationship? Have you
  captured the consumer’s imagination and affirmed for them that this was
  absolutely a great use of their money?


  Great companies (Starbucks included) use the moments that already exist in
  their businesses to build real connections; to interact with the customer in a
  way that gives them what they expected **and** a positive feeling from the
  experience.


  **What moments already exist in your business that could be better harnessed
  to truly connect with the customer?**
f_conclusion: >-
  _Onward_ is a book written with passion. Howard Shultz shows how caring deeply
  about something, and then acting on that – even when those actions fly in the
  face of conventional wisdom – is not only personally rewarding, but leads to a
  solid bottom line. At over $10 billion in revenues last year and a share price
  that’s risen over 400% since Shultz re-instilled his passion for people and
  coffee into the business, Starbucks is a shining example of how important
  purpose is to companies, regardless of their size.

It’s been a long time since a business biography resonated with me as much as _Onward_ did. In fact, I can’t remember the last time.

Full of prudent advice, emotionally engaging stories and a testament to the power of executing on a clear vision, _Onward_ is a story about Starbucks’ ceo (they lower case all titles) Howard Shultz’s return from retirement, and his mission to return the coffee giant into the passion-driven company he’d once envisioned.
