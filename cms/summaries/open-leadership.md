  ### Success Through Trust


  > "Leadership is a relationship between those who aspire to lead and those who
  choose to follow. At a time when customers and employees are redefining how
  they make and maintain relationships with social technologies, it’s high time
  that organizations rethink the foundations of business relationships as
  well."- Open Leadership, page 9


  In his presidential campaign, President Barack Obama’s use of social media
  opened people’s eyes to the power of what we’re coming to call “Open
  Leadership”; “having the confidence and humility to give up the need to be in
  control while inspiring commitment from people to accomplish goals.”
  Relinquishing control to accomplish more through collective efforts is a
  powerful concept and potentially tough for organizations to adopt. To
  highlight the concept’s opportunities for success in organizations, author
  Charlene Li shares her insights on the tactics used by various companies and
  how they achieved success.


  Open leadership is essentially about fostering new relationships and taking
  existing relationships to a deeper level. People commit to companies, projects
  and leaders that they care about. Li suggests there are five ways to nurture
  commitment as a leader, as exemplified by companies thriving in the Open
  Leadership economy:


  1.  Respect that your customers and employees have power

  2.  Share constantly to build trust

  3.  Nurture curiosity and humility

  4.  Hold openness accountable

  5.  Forgive failure.


  As you can see from the list, trust plays a major role in corporate success in
  the 21st century. Trust instills loyalty at all levels – customers to
  employees. Sharing information via Facebook, Twitter, blogs or an internal
  company intranet system connects you to your customers / employees all the
  time. Responding to people’s questions or concerns in a timely manner will
  solidify and deepen your relationship with them. Remember, the power has
  shifted and the individual consumer now has a voice that can be heard by
  millions. As a company, you need to be aware of that voice and respond to it,
  especially if it is a negative comment. Consumers respect companies that admit
  when they have made a mistake –means the company is being transparent, open
  and authentic! It is not a failure, especially when you learn from it.

  ### The Open Leadership Mindset


  > "Leadership takes on a different dimension in a connected, networked world –
  that of being a catalyst for change both outside and inside the
  organization."- Open Leadership, page 164


  There are two mindsets that define and determine how open you are as a leader.
  The first is your view of people – are you optimistic or pessimistic about
  people’s intentions? The second is your view of successes as either an
  individual success or from the efforts of a team. Where does your mindset fit
  on the spectrum?


  There are also three very important characteristics that open leaders possess:
  1) curiosity, 2) humility and, 3) a desire to develop other open leaders as
  well. Open leaders constantly seek out opportunities to improve themselves and
  the world around them. They are driven by learning and they see social
  technologies as a way for them to extend that learning. Humility gives them
  the self-awareness and confidence to admit when they are wrong or need help.
  Open leaders have members on their team who complement their weaknesses,
  allowing them to thrive in their own areas of strength. In order to create and
  sustain openness within an organization, there are four areas to focus on:


  1.  Values drive the vision

  2.  Leaders set the tone and example for others to follow

  3.  Extending the old culture into the new

  4.  Systems and structure sustain the transformation


  Throughout _Open Leadership_, Li shares several case studies that illustrate
  how each of these transformed a specific organization.

  ### Bigger than the Numbers


  > "We tend to overvalue the things we can measure, and undervalue the things
  we cannot."- John Hayes, CEO of American Express, quoted in Open Leadership,
  page 76


  One major hang up many organizations have and the one that stops them from
  implementing or fully committing to a social media strategy is that there is
  “no firm ROI on social media.” Again, they’re missing the shift in thinking.
  We need to move past the numbers; the raw “transaction” element of business.
  Successful brands are more than just the product they sell – they represent a
  movement; something bigger than themselves. Obama represented a concept –
  “Change”. Obama didn’t promise something specific to each person who donated
  to his campaign budget. Instead, he clearly shared who he was, and what he
  thought the future could look like. He painted a picture so vivid that people
  were excited to play a role in creating it. They didn’t ask about the “ROI on
  their contribution”, they moved beyond the numbers and got behind a movement.


  As John Hayes has pointed out, “There are non-financial metrics such as
  customer satisfaction and employee loyalty that can be observed and measured;
  although they don’t necessarily lead directly to revenues, you know there is a
  link \[to social media\].” (_Open Leadership_, page 76)


  At its core, Social Media is nothing more than a very inexpensive tool to
  engage with, and have meaningful conversations with, millions of people. Think
  less transactional and more conversational. It’s all about the long term.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book is a must read for every organization wanting to thrive in today’s
  open economy. The internet isn’t going away and the world of social media
  keeps growing; bigger and more engrained with our day to day life every day.
  We need to embrace this new open economy and grow alongside it. For many of us
  it is a scary thought but it truly is the only way. I hope you pick up this
  book and join the many of us who are working towards open leadership. Be a
  part of the open leadership revolution that needs to take place! Like Ghandi
  once said; ‘Be the change you wish to see in the world.”

_Open Leadership_ is a must read for organizations that wish to succeed in the years to come. The social technology revolution is here. It’s growing in leaps and bounds and companies can either jump on board or watch as their competitors blow by them – and yet, many companies out there are afraid to jump into the social media arena. They are afraid because they are not sure what the first step is and they are afraid of failure. The important point these companies are missing is that Social Media is not a “tactic” or “project”. Social Media, and all that it entails, at its core is a fundamental shift in thinking about business relationships.
