  ### Avoiding the Three P’s


  > "Hundreds of studies have shown that children and adults recover more
  quickly when they realize that hardships aren’t entirely their fault, don’t
  affect every aspect of their lives, and won’t follow them forever."- Option B,
  page 16


  To overcome adversity when it inevitably hits, it’s critical to be prepared
  for it. Think of it as a pre-emptive strike against whatever life may throw
  your way. Sandberg and Grant explain that we “plant the seeds of resilience in
  the ways we process negative events.” They cite the work of [Martin
  Seligman](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/authors/martin-e-p-seligman/),
  who labored for decades trying to understand how some survive adversity while
  others are crushed under its weight, and identified three P’s that “stunt
  recovery”. They are:


  *   **Personalization** – “the belief that we are at fault;”

  *   **Pervasiveness** – “the belief that an event will affect all areas of our
  life;”

  *   **Permanence** – “the belief that the aftershocks of the event will last
  forever.”


  Being conscious of these pitfalls is a great way to avoid them the next time
  adversity strikes. The Insights below offer two effective ways to strengthen
  your resilience muscle.

  ### Feedback


  > "The ability to listen to feedback is a sign of resilience, and some of
  those who do it best gained that strength in the hardest way possible."-
  Option B, page 151


  You might not necessarily think of feedback and resilience as being connected,
  but they are. Feedback is something that we all know is a key component to our
  growth, both personally and professionally, but how many of us are truly
  comfortable receiving it—and doling it out?


  When you’re on the receiving end of criticism, it can often be hard to accept
  without taking it personally. The authors quote law professors Doug Stone and
  Sheila Heen, who provide an effective way for you to self-evaluate how you’re
  doing on that score: “After every low score you receive, give yourself a
  ‘second score’ based on how well you handle the first score. . . . Even when
  you get an F for the situation itself, you can still earn an A+ for how you
  deal with it.”


  As for handing out negative feedback, its efficacy is all in how you frame it.
  “I’m giving you these comments because I have very high expectations and I
  know that you can reach them,” is how Sandberg often begins criticism.


  As the authors remind us, “building resilient teams and organizations takes
  open and honest communication. When companies fail, it’s usually for reasons
  that almost everyone knows but almost no one has voiced. When someone isn’t
  making good decisions, few have the guts to tell that person, especially if
  that person is the boss.”


  Sandberg is also a big proponent for having at least one hard conversation a
  month, and encourages each member of her team to do the same. It will probably
  make you a little uneasy at first, but if you keep at it up it the result can
  only be a more open and communicative organization with fewer setbacks.

  ### Turning feelings into words


  > "“…more than a hundred experiments have documented the therapeutic effect of
  journaling. It has helped medical students, patients with chronic pain, and
  women after child birth."- Option B, page 62-63


  As someone who has a passion for writing, I’m aware of how cathartic the
  process can be. However, until reading _Option B_, I had never realized the
  extent to which it can increase our self-compassion and self-confidence, and
  in turn strengthen our resilience against adversity.


  The following experiment illustrates just how profoundly effective it can be:


  “Decades ago, health psychologist Jamie Pennebaker had two groups of college
  students journal for fifteen minutes a day for just four days—some about
  nonemotional topics and others about the most traumatic experiences of their
  lives, which included rape, attempted suicide, and child abuse. After the
  first day of writing, the second group was less happy and had higher blood
  pressure. This made sense, since confronting trauma is painful. But when
  Pennebaker followed up six months later, the effects reversed and those who
  wrote about their traumas were significantly better off emotionally and
  physically.”


  Journaling has some other surprising health benefits, including:


  *   Higher T-cell counts

  *   Improved liver function

  *   Stronger antibody responses


  As the authors remind us, journaling is something we can stop and start when
  we feel it’s appropriate. They also advocate other writing related exercises
  as well, including:


  *   Recognize your small wins by jotting down three things you do well each
  day.

  *   Think back to a failure or a humiliating event (no, this is not meant to
  be masochistic). Write a letter addressed to yourself “expressing the
  understanding \[you\] would offer to a friend in the same situation. Compared
  to a control group who wrote just about their positive attributes, those who
  were kind to themselves were 40 percent happier and 24 percent less angry.”


  Go on, get writing!

> "Life is never perfect. We all live some form of Option B. This book is to help us all kick the shit out of it." _\- Option B, page 13_

On May 1, 2015, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg’s life was shattered in a single instant. While on vacation abroad in Mexico, Sandberg’s husband, Dave Goldberg (SurveyMonkey’s CEO) died suddenly and unexpectedly, sending her life into a tailspin.

In _Option B_, Sandberg and her co-author, Adam Grant _(_[_Originals_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/originals/)_)_, write with unvarnished candor about overcoming adversity by strengthening your resilience muscle. While, mercifully, not all of us will face the kind of devastating tragedy that Sandberg has endured, none of us are immune to setbacks in one form or another. “We all deal with loss: jobs lost, loves lost, lives lost,” the authors write. “The question is not whether these things will happen. They will, and we will have to face them.”

Sandberg and Grant give us the tools to do just that.
