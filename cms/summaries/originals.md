  ### Kissing Frogs


  > "The odds of producing an influential or successful idea, are a positive
  function of the total number of ideas generated."- Originals, page 35


  Grant’s research concludes that those with great “original” ideas aren’t
  necessarily the ones that are able to tell if their idea will be a hit or not.
  Interesting, right? Ultimately, the market will decide if you are deserving of
  being successful and that’s not always in our control. What is in our control,
  however, and the common factor that all “Originals” share is that they produce
  great ideas simply because they generate more ideas and more work. Makes
  sense, right? Produce more work and the likelihood of you producing an idea
  that is a hit or that is truly original goes up tremendously. The common
  perception is that you should be aiming to produce quality over quantity, but
  the opposite is actually true. What’s that quote, “You miss 100% of the shots
  you don’t take”? Similar thought process here.


  If you want to be original, the most important thing you can possibly do is to
  produce a huge volume of work.

  ### Rethinking Groupthink


  > "Groupthink is the enemy of Originality, people feel pressured to conform to
  the dominant, default views instead of championing diversity of thought."-
  Originals, page 176


  Grant defines groupthink as “the tendency to seek consensus instead of
  fostering dissent.” After examining a couple of “groupthink” examples that
  were used in the book – Polaroid, Bridgewater Associates and the Bay of Pigs –
  I realized the huge risk that teams and organizations face if they have a
  groupthink culture. In this section, Adam Grant examines organizations that
  went along with groupthink and significantly paid the price for it and
  contrasted it with an organization who will fire you if you don’t push back
  and challenge the status quo.


  I love this quote by the author: “when a group becomes that cohesive, it
  develops a strong culture – people share the same values and norms, and
  believe in them intensely. And there’s a fine line between having a strong
  culture and operating like a cult.”

  ### Fools Rush In


  > "Procrastination may be the enemy of productivity, but it can be a resource
  for creativity."- Originals, page 95


  Most everyone thinks procrastination is a bad thing, right? Especially in
  corporate America today. So much of the conversation is how can we be more
  productive and how can we make our teams/organizations more productive. While
  it’s true that there’s more “to do” today than ever before and the fact that
  we’re more accessible today than ever before, our lack of “procrastination”
  does often cost us when it comes to productivity.


  However, what we make up in productivity, we actually lose in creativity. Adam
  Grant dives into this topic by telling a story about Martin Luther King and
  his process of writing his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Needless to say,
  MLK took his time in writing the speech, which really allowed him to remain
  flexible in what he was going to say, all the way up until the moment he
  stepped on stage. Procrastination in this instance also allowed MLK to be open
  to improvising his speech. While speaking, someone in the crowd kept yelling
  out – “tell them about the dream” and because MLK wasn’t tied down to an exact
  scripted message, he was able to draw upon his experience and his audience’s
  wishes to deliver, arguably, the most influence speech of the 20th century.


  This has very practical ties to the business world as well. Bestselling author
  Malcolm Gladwell says, “Would you rather be second or third and see how the
  guy in first did and then… improve it? When ideas get really complicated, and
  the world gets complicated, it’s foolish to think the person who’s first can
  work it all out. Most good things, it takes a long time to figure them out.”
  What Gladwell and Grant are ultimately saying is that there’s value in taking
  your time and it’s very difficult for the first person out to continuously
  grow and evolve to keep with up the rapid change of the market and our
  society. Sometimes coming in second or third place gives you the opportunity
  to succeed longer term.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Originals_ by Adam Grant is a serious gold mine of great learning! I haven’t
  enjoyed a book this much in a few months. Grant’s writing style is engaging
  and the stories and examples used throughout the book are so interesting.
  _Originals_ is one of those books that will change the way you think and look
  at situations that are going on in your life. That alone is worth the time
  investment, but since we’re all about being actionable here, the author
  includes “Actions for Impact” at the end of the book, which are tangible
  action steps to incorporate these ideas into your life.

> "Becoming original is not the easiest path in the pursuit of happiness, but it leaves us perfectly poised for the happiness of pursuit." _\- Originals, page 243_

_Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World_ explores how each of us have the ability to influence and change our world in a way that makes a positive impact not only on today, but in years to come. The author of _Originals_ is the remarkable Adam Grant. Grant is, among many things, a professor at Wharton, a bestselling author, a PHD and a social scientist who speaks and consults with organizations all over the world.

_Originals_ will without a doubt make you pause and think about how you can contribute and impact your job, your family, and your community in ways that you might have never thought about. The author examines this topic of originality through a number of studies and fascinating stories ranging from:

*   An entrepreneur who pitches his startups by highlighting the reasons not to invest in them
*   A women at Apple who dared to challenge Steve Jobs from three management levels below
*   An analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA
*   A billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him
*   A movie producer who asked a single question that saved Disney’s first animated film based on an original story from the cutting room floor

What I enjoy most about this book and Adam Grant in general is that he challenges me to look and think differently. I have no doubt that you’ll feel the same way after reading it.

I’ll leave you with an inspiring quote from Adam Grant: “Originals embrace the uphill battle, striving to make the world what it could be. By struggling to improve life and liberty, they may temporarily give up some pleasure, putting their own happiness on the back burner. In the long run, though, they have the chance to create a better world.”
