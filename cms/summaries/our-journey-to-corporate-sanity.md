  ### Purpose is Foundational


  > "We have an incredible opportunity to see business from a more holistic
  perspective. Imagine what would happen if we each had clarity on how we could
  help our organization succeed and, as a result, stop grappling with our own
  career path and need for a personal brand. It is an opportunity to integrate
  your life and no longer view your career as outside of yourself."- Our Journey
  to Corporate Sanity, page 256


  At Actionable, we talk a lot about employee engagement. The statistics around
  engagement are dismal—at least two out of every three people are disengaged
  from their work. Part of the problem is foundational: not knowing how your
  work fits into the larger goals of an organization is a recipe for discontent.


  We are taught from an early age to tie our identities to our work. “What do
  you want to be when you grow up?” is a question we often pose to children, and
  hope for a career oriented answer. Firefighter, doctor, teacher—are all
  acceptable answers. If a child answered “I want to be happy and fulfilled when
  I grow up,” many of us would be taken aback.


  The result of this tendency is compartmentalization. “Work/Life balance” is
  the elusive goal for so many, and yet, even striving for this balance implies
  a non-existent duality—as though work and life are indeed separate entities.
  Baron dares to envision a world in which we recognize that work is part of our
  lives. Where we can view our careers as an essential part of ourselves, take
  pride in what we do, and contribute to our organizations with enthusiasm and
  pride.

  ### Put the Map Down


  > "Sometimes you need to put the map down. No one has the course charted for
  you, no matter how much they may try to convince you that they know what you
  need in your life right now… Whatever your path, it is vividly and painfully
  clear that we have to stop the insanity of putting profits ahead of people,
  and evolve the world of work as a more purpose-driven experience."- Our
  Journey to Corporate Sanity, page 485


  Many people, myself included, have learned the hard way that traditional
  “path” to success doesn’t lead where we thought it would. We were encouraged
  to attend University, often taking on high levels of debt to do so, because we
  were told it would lead directly to a great job. We could pay off the debt in
  no time, save a down-payment, own homes, and achieve a middle-class existence
  quickly. For so many, that turned out to be a false assumption.


  There is no one-size fits all definition of success—and trying to fit into a
  mould that doesn’t suit us is a recipe for unhappiness. Baron argues for a
  more individual approach. One that questions the pre-conceived notions and
  structures in place, and allows for personal growth.


  For most of my twenties, I worked in the service industry. While this
  aggravated my parents to no end (but I had a Master’s degree! Wasn’t I wasting
  my potential? I could never buy a house and “settle down” on minimum wage plus
  tips!), I was happy. I was good at my job, I had time to pursue projects that
  were important to me, and could get a few of my wilder impulses out of my
  system without negative consequences. I eventually came around to truly
  wanting a more conventional job, but that was a conclusion I reached in my own
  time.


  Put down the roadmap that you’ve inherited, and think about pursuing what
  makes you happy. Of course, basic needs must be met, but if you find yourself
  coming home from work every day drained and unhappy, I encourage you to seek
  out work that energizes you. Maybe that means changing the structure of the
  organization or team that you run, making changes to your individual position
  within the organization, or polishing up your resume and seeking work
  elsewhere. You don’t need to spend 40+ hours a week doing something that makes
  you unhappy just because society tells you that you should.

  ### Work Out Loud


  > "Working out loud means that we openly share what we are working on in a way
  that brings other people to understand how they can also contribute. When you
  work out loud, you build and strengthen relationships."- Our Journey to
  Corporate Sanity, page 323


  As a virtual workforce, the Actionable team uses Slack to stay in regular
  contact (I’m sure that Slack is fantastic when you share an office space as
  well). Each week, we see a report that shows how many of our messages take
  place privately, and how many occur in public channels. As a team, we are
  trying to get better at migrating our conversations to the public
  channels—there is no real reason our day to day activities need to take place
  in private, though that seems to be the default stance (we are a team of
  introverts).


  After reading _Our Journey to Corporate Sanity_, I will be redoubling my
  efforts to make my day to day discussions more public. Not because every
  member of the team _needs_ to be up to date on the details of the work that I
  do, but because opening the conversation to other perspectives can only
  strengthen the work that we do together.


  Working out loud will look different for each organization, and of course,
  there are environments where privacy and discretion are an important part of
  the job. But so often, conversations happen in private for no other reason
  than a feeling of protectiveness or precedent. I am the first to admit that I
  often feel like I am the “owner” of the work I do, and communicate about my
  work in private as a default stance. Going forward, I will be making
  additional efforts to work out loud, to solicit and encourage input, and to
  view my work as a small part of a larger (and fantastic) team.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Our Journey to Corporate Sanity_ takes the reader on a series of
  “expeditions,” which feature compelling stories from successful entrepreneurs.
  Baron frames each expedition as a journey toward a mindset shift—the
  cumulative effect of each shift is a more sane, more human approach to
  business. While not all of us are CEOs or entrepreneurs, we can all aspire to
  meaningful work that values people over profits.

  “There is an increasing yearning for deeper experiences, alongside the
  awareness that continually numbing ourselves with superficial achievements and
  acquiring more and more possessions does not actually fulfill us. In the
  frenzy to achieve success on this materialistic and achievement driven road,
  we have lost vital pieces of ourselves.”

> “There is an increasing yearning for deeper experiences, alongside the awareness that continually numbing ourselves with superficial achievements and acquiring more and more possessions does not actually fulfill us. In the frenzy to achieve success on this materialistic and achievement driven road, we have lost vital pieces of ourselves.” _\- Our Journey to Corporate Sanity, page 9_

_Our Journey To Corporate Sanity_ by Ayelet Baron isn’t your standard business book. Baron pairs stories from her own life with the stories of successful entrepreneurs and business people, in order to argue that traditional definitions of success no longer carry the same relevance as they once did. Striving for constant growth may look great on a balance sheet, but it doesn’t do much to serve the people who pour their heart and souls into their work. Furthermore, the relentless pursuit of growth and profits over people has resulted in some pretty frightening damage to our environment. Baron argues for a more sane definition of success: one that prioritizes personal happiness, environmental responsibility, and letting go of the cut-throat competition that characterizes so many corporate goals.
