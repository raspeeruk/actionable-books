  ### "How To"


  > "For nearly two months I suffered with the worst of all ailments;
  indecision. – I knew the seventeen principles of personal achievement but what
  I did not know was how to apply them."- Outwitting the Devil, page 11


  The entirely fascinating start to the book where Hill tells us about his
  failures and battles with doubt and indecisiveness had me hooked. We hear
  stories of his own paralyzing fear like the day in July 1923 when he received
  an anonymous phone call warning him he was destined for a pine box if he
  didn’t leave Ohio within the hour. He escaped immediately to West Virginia and
  he speaks of how his courage left him and his nerves cracked. Hill speaks from
  the heart of someone who has experienced the fear, procrastination, frozen
  thoughts and general uselessness that visits us mere mortals. He entreats us
  to learn how to control our thinking and he declares quite simply that **you
  are either motivated by fear or by faith.** Faith he refers to as a miracle, a
  sixth sense.


  Hill interviewed 25,000 men and women rated as failures and over 500 that were
  classed as successful including Henry Ford, Thomas A. Edison and John D.
  Rockefeller over a period of twenty years for his groundbreaking book _Think
  and Grow Rich._ He says “How strange after talking with the greatest men I
  sought out the Devil for a working knowledge of the greatest of all principles
  uncovered in my quest for truth. How strange I was forced to experience
  poverty and failure and adversity before understanding the law of nature.”


  We are treated to lengthy debate between Hill and the Devil, which results in
  seven principles showing us _how to_ create our own success by:


  *   Definiteness of purpose

  *   Mastery over self

  *   Learning from adversity

  *   Controlling environmental influence (association)

  *   Time (giving permanency to positive rather than negative thought habits
  and developing wisdom)

  *   Harmony (acting with definiteness of purpose to become the dominating
  influence in your own mental, spiritual and physical environment

  *   Caution (thinking before you act)

  ### Self-discipline


  > "People who achieve outstanding success – is usually in exact ratio to their
  experiences of defeat before succeeding."- Outwitting the Devil, page 202


  In order to combat drifting, Hill urges us to use self-discipline. What I love
  about this book is that it is in many ways a product of its time; definitive
  and reverential in its tone, intermittently bursting into bombastic colourful
  language like when Hill directs that self-discipline means mastering three
  appetites: 1) our desire for food 2) the desire for expression of sex and 3)
  the desire to express loosely organized opinions. Hill’s words are piercing.
  He says **we should stop overeating and taking rich food as _we poison and
  clog up the body sewer system_, causing us to be sluggish** and he finishes
  with the statement “_If he (the person) could only take one good look at and
  one bad smell of his sewer system–he would be ashamed to look at himself in
  the face.”_ Now that’s telling us to get ourselves in order.


  But self-discipline does not mean that we will inevitably be successful. Hill
  talks about his own challenges, fears and failures, and uses the Devil to
  repeat that misfortune or hardship are the walking shadow to success. He
  believes that what we endure will bring a corresponding benefit. He declares
  that **adversity is a good thing as adversity allows you to form new habits,
  which serve to break the hold of _hypnotic rhythm_ and change your path from
  negative to positive.** The term hypnotic rhythm refers to the mindlessness
  that we enter into on a regular basis. Continuing the spiritual element to our
  lives he says, “It is a sin to accept from life anything one does not want
  because that indicates an unpardonable neglect to use the mind.”

  ### Drifting


  > "My greatest weapon over human beings consists of two secret principles by
  which I gain control of their minds. I will speak first of the principle of
  habit, through which I silently enter the minds of people. By operating
  through this principle, I establish (I wish I could avoid using this word) the
  habit of drifting. When a person begins to drift on any subject, he is headed
  straight toward the gates of what you earthbound call Hell."- Outwitting the
  Devil, page 73


  Drifting is a fabulous word that Hill has utilized to describe what happens
  when we no longer focus on our purpose, whatever that may be. We are even
  guiltier of this “drifting” today as our attention is hijacked by e-mail,
  blogs, web sites or any number of advertisers. The devil intrudes on us by
  disrupting our thoughts and slowly establishing bad habits that ultimately do
  not serve us well but we have a devil of a job to get rid of!


  **Hill urges us to retain a definite purpose in everything that we do.** He is
  unremittingly damning of the education and religious systems that he says help
  retain poor thinking and ultimately fail us all. And when Hill asks the Devil
  how come he doesn’t just get rid of all the churches so that God is
  annihilated from people’s thinking – the Devil quickly retorts that it is the
  Churches that keep him alive in people’s minds by filling us all with fear of
  the Devil, Hell and damnation. So without God he would disappear from people’s
  thinking, wither and perish and this in many ways mirrors the position he
  takes on success and failure – that each generates the other.
f_conclusion: >-
  Part of the original typewriter manuscript illustrates emphatically how
  technology has moved forward. So, does this text have anything worthy to hold
  our attention now? The work has been annotated by Sharon Lechter, co-author of
  the international bestseller _Rich Dad Poor Dad_, and there is a forward by
  Mark Victor Hansen, creator of _Chicken Soup for the Soul,_ so it is trumpeted
  by the leaders in the field. Impressive accolades, but is it fur coat and no
  knickers? I think not. There is indeed a great deal to get to grips with but
  not in a simple, docile way. This is a book that demands more from you—only if
  you have a thirst for knowledge should you venture into this deep and spookily
  accurate book.

> "I discovered that happiness, the highest aim of mankind, was mine for the taking, business depression or no business depression." _\- Outwitting the Devil, page 44_

_Outwitting the Devil_ communicates with Satan the most terrifying evil spirit imaginable. He isn’t a “red horned, long tailed being holding a fork” (2 Cor. 11:14) _but instead a wicked malevolent presence ….in your mind_. Hill interviews the devil methodically and mercilessly wringing from him the essence of living a life of personal achievement.

This book is mostly written as questions to and answers from, the Devil, who insists on being referred to as Your Majesty. But this devil is confident that even with the knowledge of how to resist his presence we will still succumb to his authority, or in other words, his ability to manipulate us to be “drifters”. **The Devil tells us that he controls 98% of people** and Hill reveals systematically what we need to do to outwit the Devil and be masters of our own destiny. He starts from the position of his own personal hopelessness, his inability to create a plan, and his rise from indecisiveness to a measured unfolding of the missing key even more relevant to us during times of negativity and recession.

The strange interview with the Devil focuses on Napoleon Hill’s determination to discover what it is that prevents us from achieving success. This is an intriguing read, revealing why his family chose to hold on to this manuscript for **_seventy years_** (written in 1938) before seeing it published. And a secret chapter is also offered to those who want to read further online. **The book starts with Napoleon Hill’s own demons.**
