  ### The engine of the oversubscribed business


  > "Becoming oversubscribed isn’t something you can do on the fly; it takes
  preparation and strategy executed with precision."- Oversubscribed, page 91


  A **campaign driven enterprise** is the identity businesses need to adopt in
  order to become oversubscribed.


  While most businesses are set up to win and service clients one at a time, the
  campaign driven approach encourages many people to engage with the business at
  one time. This creates synergistic buzz and excitement, and avoids boredom and
  burnout of the one to one approach.


  There are five phases in a campaign:


  1.  Planning – Know your capacity, who it is for and when you can deliver it.

  2.  Build-up – Signal to the market what you are planning and get them to
  signal back their intention to buy.

  3.  Release the products when oversubscribed, in stages, in the form of
  different price points and special editions to maintain momentum and energy.

  4.  Remarkable delivery – under-promise, over-deliver.

  5.  Innovate and celebrate – Share the success stories publicly, analyse the
  data for future improvement, reward the team and have some downtime.


  Apple campaigns are powerful because of the way they are launched. Curiosity
  is built-up before the event. After the launch, people are asked to pre-order
  to signal their interests. Steve Jobs thought it was ok to make people wait
  for information, the release date and even wait outside physical stores before
  they could buy. Apple devices were released in stages, to selected countries.
  This allowed the company to manage its capacity and ensure that quality did
  not suffer because of large demand. As a result, happy customers felt that
  they were part of something special.


  A Campaign Driven Enterprise has four key members, each with a specific role:


  1.  **Key person of influence** – A leader who is known, liked and trusted
  within the industry, so as to bring the team together.

  2.  **Head of sales and marketing** – Manages leads, close sales and follow up
  with referrals.

  3.  **Head of operations and production** – Focuses on improving processes and
  delivering values consistently.

  4.  **Head of finance, logistics and reporting** – Helps to steer the campaign
  towards a profitable result. Actively seeks access to investments, loans,
  grants and discounts.


  The team members must work together to create a high performance culture.

  ### Leverage technology


  > "No matter what your business is, you are also a media and technology
  business. It’s nearly impossible to become oversubscribed at any scale without
  the use of media and technology."- Oversubscribed, page 128


  Daniel observed that big purchasing decisions will take about seven hours,
  when you add up all the time you spend researching and thinking about it.


  Google looks at these as touch points (Zero Moments of Truth – ZMOT) where
  people find out about a business as they are making a purchasing decision.
  Their research indicates that it takes an average of 11 touch points or
  ‘ZMOTs’ in order to build up trust with someone. They also advocate that a lot
  of these touch points can be found online as digital content.


  Businesses can leverage social media and digital technology to create and
  distribute 7 hours or 11 touch points of relationship building content. The
  goal is to entertain and educate the audience using articles, podcasts,
  videos, apps, questionnaires, reports, illustrations, books, case studies, and
  events.


  Be generous with relevant ideas and information for building relationship.
  People will then trust the business for implementation.


  To be effective as a Campaign Driven Enterprise, a business will need to be
  fast at building web pages, collecting meaningful data, using that data
  powerfully to optimise the business online.


  In particular, a business needs systems to keep track of client interactions,
  to manage delivery of products, and to set up follow-up reminders and
  notifications. Without such automation, it would not be possible to scale
  remarkable delivery. It is necessary to know which technologies are worth
  paying for, or can be built in-house, or obtained at a low cost.

  ### Word of mouth is powerful marketing

  is to ‘cook great steak’ and let your customers create ‘the sizzle’."-
  Oversubscribed, page 153


  In this age of social media, negative reviews spread rapidly among thousands
  of Facebook friends and Twitter followers, and become indexed on Google to
  haunt a business for years.


  On the other hand, if people talk about a business in a positive way, its
  marketing budget reduces to zero.


  Daniel states that the most powerful way to become oversubscribed is to be
  utterly remarkable in everything you do. That means having products or
  services that are worth talking about, offering genuine benefits and a
  superior experience.


  Oversubscribed businesses often talk about something bigger than what they do.
  They talk about the lifestyle of their customers, philosophy, a big problem
  they want to solve or the transformation they want to see in the world.


  For example, Chipotle is a Mexican fast food restaurant but if it talks about
  Mexican fast food it becomes commoditized, dull and adds to a noisy
  marketplace. Instead, Chipotle talks about ‘cultivating a better world’. In a
  Nike campaign, Michael Jordan talks about his failures, which are a big part
  of his success.


  Most businesses make the mistake of chasing after people who are not their
  customers instead of nurturing existing ones. Oversubscribed businesses treat
  their clients like celebrities and let them pull a crowd.


  For example, Daniel built his business by sharing client success stories and
  attracting people who aspire to be the next successful client.


  A business can be remarkable for its innovative approach or its remarkably
  fair deals. In either case, if the name of a business comes up in response to
  the question, ‘who should I buy from?’, then that is a remarkable business.

  _Oversubscribed_ reminds us that the purpose of a business should always be to
  serve its best clients within its capacity so as not to dilute its effort and
  disappoint everyone.

Being oversubscribed means there are more buyers than the capacity a business owner can provide.

In every industry, there are many businesses struggling to get enough customers and yet there are those with customers lining up, joining the waiting list and paying a premium to buy from them. They are so successful that they have to turn away some customers because they are oversubscribed.

With the current search technologies and the abundance of choices, why do people decide to wait for a product or pay a premium rather than to select other available or cheaper ones? Over a period of two years, Daniel Priestley studied all types of oversubscribed businesses, from hairdressers, fashion brands, restaurants and nightclubs to consultants and luxury cars to find out what they have in common. The result is _Oversubscribed: How to Get People Lining Up to Do Business with You_.

He observed that oversubscribed businesses have **remarkable qualities** and are **very good at running promotions and campaigns.**

This book describes the principles, mindset and methods to become oversubscribed.
