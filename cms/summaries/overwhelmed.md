  ### Leisure is a choice


  > "The 'miracle of now' is to choose to do something with no other aim that it
  refreshes the soul, or to choose to do nothing at all. To just BE and feel
  fully alive."- Overwhelmed, page 51


  When I read this quote my immediate reaction was, “Do nothing? That sounds
  hard.” But considering I was on vacation at the time I decided to purposefully
  put this to the test and choose leisure.


  This wasn’t as easy as you might think given all the sights and places to see
  in Italy. It is quite easy to fall into the trap of ‘must see, must do
  everything since I may never be back here’ kind of thinking. In fact, some
  days it felt just like that. Lots of seeing and doing but not so much ‘being.’


  Perhaps, in our culture, our perspective of leisure is not a positive one. We
  associate the concept with laziness or being idle or frivolous. So, if one
  goes to Italy you had better cram it all in and see and taste everything. But
  according to one of several leisure researchers that Ms.Schulte met with,
  leisure is “simply being open to the wonder and marvel of the present.”


  And so I made some choices. Choices not to go to the Spanish Steps or the
  Trevi Fountain while in Rome even though they were on my ‘must see’ list. This
  allowed a more relaxed, less rushed evening watching the kids play on a
  bridge. I chose to end our day early in Pisa and go and just sit in a garden
  with a pool, doing nothing except admire my surroundings.


  It was through reading Brigid Schulte’s book that this concept of choosing
  leisure being up to me became clear. I had to deliberately choose it. As she
  quotes Carl Sandburg, “time is the coin of your life. You spend it. Do not
  allow others to spend it for you.”

  ### Just 'be' in the moment


  > "We are so riveted getting to the next thing that we miss out on life, miss
  out on love, miss out on being in the moment."- Overwhelmed, page 275


  Ok, sorry about that, I left you for a few moments. I was sitting at my desk
  working on this summary when I realized there was only one hour before my
  daughter would leave for camp for a week. For a brief second I kept working
  but then I realized… I need to live this moment… right now… with her. So I
  left the desk and spent the hour with her.


  It is these little things, these slight, but significant changes in our
  everyday life that Ms. Schultz advocates for in her book. One of her
  suggestions is that we consciously unplug or go off the grid for a chunk of
  time each day. Another idea is to choose one thing that’s most important to do
  every day. Choosing to spend uninterrupted, gadget free time with my daughter
  was definitely the most important thing I did that day.


  And so, among some of the practical application points that I have put into
  effect in my life as a result of reading this book, the household chore of
  dusting will just have to get wait for another day. Ciao!

  ### Let it go


  > "Sometimes it’s as if we’re racing to the finish line our whole lives,
  skimming the surface and never dropping into life, as if life is a problem to
  be solved rather than a mystery to be lived."- Overwhelmed, page 278


  Ms. Schulte examines the concept of leisure within three facets of life: at
  work, in love, at play. She examines the pressures (both real and self
  imposed) on both males and females in the corporate world. She describes the
  model of an ‘ideal worker’ and how our culture has embraced this notion that
  we are 150 percent committed to the work place, so much so that we derive our
  identity from our vocation. Our culture has also come to expect us all to be
  the ‘ideal worker.’ Within this model there is no room to be human. No room to
  be good at your job _and_ be a good parent and spouse.


  In love we see challenges to leisure in the form of expectations on genders
  and how we often succumb to powerful unconscious stereotypes of “ideal worker,
  provider father, and the idea mother.” Because we have given all we have to
  give to the work place we often have nothing left to give at home or to our
  partner. Life at home can be just as crazy busy as the office, especially when
  you add kids into the equation. Leisure and play often have to be scheduled
  and put on the calendar as there is very little wiggle room for spontaneity.


  There is a story that Schultz shares called “The Lesson of the Twinkie” that I
  think captures the essence of ‘letting go’ perfectly. She recalls how she
  signed up to bring baked goods to her son’s school concert and then forgot to
  bake them. She only realized this as she was driving to the event. She pulled
  over to a convenience store and her husband came out with two boxes of
  Twinkies. She was mortified as this was not what the ‘ideal mother/ideal
  worker’ would do. However, the embarrassment was unnecessary as those Twinkies
  were scarfed down in a heartbeat by a bunch of delighted middle schoolers. To
  let go of perfection is key to experiencing all life has to offer.

When I first picked up this book I had no time to read it. The school year was wrapping up which meant I had multiple kid related things to manage, I was in the middle of planning a vacation, had several blog related deadlines, an article submission due, my fridge broke, and my son came down with strep throat. Sound familiar?

Well, Brigid Schulte, author of _Overwhelmed: Work, Love, and Play When No One Has the Time_ found her life in this all too familiar out of control spiral of busyness—trying to juggle time pressures and modern life—when she decided to apply her journalism background to the quest of rediscovering leisure.

“Leisure, who has time for that?” Indeed, it is almost a foreign concept, but that wasn’t always the case. Greek philosophers believed that “living a life of leisure was the highest aim of human being. True leisure, they believed, free from the drudgery of work, not only refreshed the soul but also opened it up. It was time and a space where one could be most fully human.”

And so, I unearthed my copy of the book which had been sitting on a shelf collecting dust for several weeks (I never seem to have time to get to that household chore). It wasn’t until I was on the plane bound for Italy that I really began to read it.
