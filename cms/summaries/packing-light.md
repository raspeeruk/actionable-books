  ### Pack light


  > "Life, if we’re being honest with ourselves, will be a little bit like
  brushing your teeth from a water bottle and eating breakfast from a plastic
  yogurt container out of a cooler in your backseat. There will be dirty
  laundry, and it will be virtually impossible to keep up with all of your
  email, and it will be really easy to fall into a routine."- Packing Light,
  page 237


  When you go on a trip you make decisions about what to bring with you and what
  to leave behind. The act of packing for a trip helps to clarify priorities.
  When confronted with the physical constraints of what you can take with you,
  additional items, or those of dubious value, tend to dwindle. If your
  destination is a week on a tropical beach it does not make much sense to pack
  your down jacket no matter its quality.


  Even with a clear destination in mind you may have a tendency to over pack.
  The “just in case”, and the “well, there is room”, quickly fill up a suitcase.
  Then with the additional things you take the more complicated the trip
  becomes, and you have to carry, maintain and organize it all.


  The idea of packing light does not dictate a certain quota, nor is the goal to
  get rid of everything. The intent is to reduce the baggage that clutters up
  your life, so that you can enjoy life more fully.


  Packing light is not necessarily limited to decluttering physical items. Maybe
  you could pack lighter with emotions or relations. Packing light is about
  reassessing routines and habits and reducing the extraneous that happen by way
  of rote redundancy. Maybe it is emotional, such as an acquaintance who always
  prattles on about how terrible his life is, weighing you down with his
  problems. Or maybe you continue to receive your monthly _National Geographic_
  subscription despite not having read the last 15 issues.


  Not everyone can, or even wants to pack up for an extended road trip, but
  there are still applicable lessons for those of us that are homebound or have
  less transient addresses. You can start packing light by doing something that
  jars you from your routine. For some taking inventory of your baggage might
  consist of brushing your teeth on the side of the road with a water bottle.

  ### Resistance isn't always a bad sign


  > "...sometimes when things get hard, too many of us assume we’re moving the
  wrong direction... like if we’re doing life right, it’s supposed to be easy."-
  Packing Light, page 238


  When you try to do something new it likely will not be easy. There will be
  resistance. For some, the thought is “Oh, this resistance is a sign that I
  should do something different.” Some things are difficult and take time to
  experience even a modicum of visible progress. Vesterfelt explains that
  occasionally things would fall into place for a few days on her trip, however
  more frequently the logistics of travel and lodging required considerable
  effort. Initially, she felt this difficulty was evidence that she should give
  up the trip and head home. With time she realized the struggle wasn’t a sign
  that the universe was conspiring against her, rather it was an affirmation
  that things of value take effort. Are you trying to do something you have
  never done before? Is it difficult? Don’t take it as an immediate indication
  that you should be doing something different.

  ### Adjust expectations


  > "It’s not about ignoring expectations, or lowering them. It’s about letting
  the events of our journey shape our expectations, even as they shape us. If
  the location where you’re standing is less than energizing, check your vision.
  Don’t abandon your expectations. Try to see them from a different
  perspective."- Packing Light, page 109


  How often have you been in a situation that didn’t turn out as you had
  expected? Maybe you are expecting a date night at a nice restaurant with your
  wife and the timing belt breaks on your car and rather than enjoying a nice
  dinner you spend a few hours walking to secure a truck to tow the vehicle.
  Vesterfelt explains that the answer is not to completely remove expectations
  but to cultivate the ability to adjust them. It is okay to adjust your
  expectations, to change your mind about situations, experiences or people.


  While I didn’t expect to spend a few hours walking along a country road, I had
  a great conversation with my wife that was quite enjoyable. Our expectations
  were not wrong, but in order not to be disappointed with a situation beyond
  our control we both had to adjust our expectations.
f_conclusion: >-
  Packing light is difficult, especially when you don’t have something such as
  an extended road trip to force you to take an inventory of all that you carry
  with you. I found in my own life that packing up and traveling for six months
  was not feasible, but I have taken an inventory of my physical clutter. I did
  a spring cleaning, if you will, to figure out if the physical stuff in my life
  I actually want. Doing a packing light inventory on my non-physical stuff was
  not as cut and dry. I found that writing out different frustrations,
  expectations and thoughts helped to clarify what my baggage was. From there I
  was able to correct, remove or address my non-physical baggage.

> "We are all carrying baggage—things we’ve picked up at home, past experiences, expectations for what’s ahead. It might look different than mine, but it weighs you down just the same." _\- Packing Light, page 18_

Emotional baggage is a cliché for a reason. Everyone has experiences, relationships, disappointments that weigh them down. Less than ideal situations are not exclusive to your position in life or age; however, author Allison Vesterfelt believes that by packing light you can do some spring cleaning with your baggage. She felt that something was holding her back in her life. So she quit her job, sold most of her possessions, and embarked on a road trip to all 50 states and wrote about her experience in _Packing Light_.
