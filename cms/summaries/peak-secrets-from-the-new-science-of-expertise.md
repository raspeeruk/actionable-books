  ### Why You?


  > "Make a list of the ten reasons why someone should join your organization."-
  Peak, page 99


  **Who are you attracting?** Make sure you don’t gloss over that, as it’s a
  question worth asking and, sadly, not one we ask ourselves enough. What type
  of employees are you attracting to your team? Those just thankful to have a
  job? Or the rock stars of your industry? What type of clients – those shopping
  strictly on price, or those looking for something more?


  If you find you’re not currently attracting exactly the type of people you
  want (on both sides of the counter), it’s time to take stock in that. The
  suggestion to, “Make a list of the ten reasons why someone should join your
  organization” may seem staff-centric, but if you consider your organization to
  be a cause or movement, then those who “join you”, can do so as employees,
  clients, or even investors.


  Make the list and, if you’re looking for extra credit, consider how the items
  on that list fit into the Hierarchy of Needs.


  _Peak_ is brilliant. Rich, informative and immediately applicable, this book
  is a fantastic tool for leaders looking to do more in their professional
  lives. As we move as a society from a money economy to a satisfaction economy,
  the words and wisdom of Abe Maslow may very well be our best guide yet.

  ### Define Your Pyramid(s)


  > "Virtually any well-known company that has created an evangelistic customer
  base could draw its own pyramid."- Peak, page 149


  One of the most widely recognized tattoos is the Harley Davidson logo. Tattoo.
  **Logo.** We see it so often, we take it for granted. I own a Volkswagen
  Jetta, but I’m not about to get the VW permanently emblazoned on my body. Why?
  Because VW’s a car company and, despite the fact that they make great bikes,
  Harley Davidson is simply more. And they’ve created that “more” patiently and
  deliberately.


  Harley makes great bikes, satisfying the lower level “needs”. But they don’t
  stop there. Harley also created the “Harley’s Owner Group” (H.O.G.) – an
  opportunity for their customers to connect with one another and build
  relationships, effectively meeting the desires of their customer base. And,
  finally, Harley stands for something. They stand for freedom of expression –
  the rebellious urge to live life on your own rules, and to enjoy the freedom
  of the open road. Harley gets it. So do Apple, Southwest, Patagonia and dozens
  of other companies. They provide their loyal customer base with a great base
  offering, but then immediately tie them into something greater. They do it for
  their customers, and they do it for their employees.


  What do your pyramids look like? What do you provide on the base level? What
  about the midrange needs of your customers and employees – how are you
  addressing their desire for “success” versus “survival”? And finally, what’s
  the cause? People inherently want to be tied to something greater than
  themselves. Give them all three levels, or someone else will.
