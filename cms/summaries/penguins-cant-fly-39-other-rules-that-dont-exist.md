  ### Do what you’ve always done, get what you’ve always gotten


  > "But the person who is wise, curious, and childlike knows there just might
  be a better way to sell books, rent movies, do business. Or live life. Be THAT
  person."- Penguins Can’t Fly, page 114


  Throughout the book Kotecki encourages us to be curious. He begs us to look at
  things from a different angle. When our “adultitis” kicks in telling us not to
  do something, he tells us to ask “why not?” Kotecki wants readers to question
  the common knowledge we’ve come to know, and look for another way to do
  things.


  In the section on common knowledge, Kotecki points out that there was a time
  when books only came in hard backs, we rented movies for one night from brick
  and mortar locations, and feature films weren’t animated. We shouldn’t
  continue to do what we have always done, just because we have always done it
  that way. At work, we do some things the way we do them because we have always
  done them that way. But there’s a better way! Rather than focus on things that
  are out of my hands (I’m looking at you, accounting department, with your
  paper trail), I will begin to focus on the things that I CAN change.


  Things I can control: when I check my email. Is it most productive to check it
  first thing in the morning? (I’ll have to experiment.) Do I have to sit at a
  desk to do my best work? (The answer to that one is no. I work remote. I was
  on the couch, with my dog, for one of the best
  over-the-phone-brainstorming-sessions I’ve had with my manager.) What’s the
  right fun-to-structure ratio for our weekly staff meetings? (There was a time
  when I thought it should be zero fun, all structure.) I’ll be exploring these
  and other questions, with a focus on curious and childlike answers, in the
  coming months.

  ### Nothing to fear but fear itself


  > "If you want to be realistic, be realistic about your fears. After all, most
  of the things you worry about will never happen."- Penguins Can’t Fly, page
  135


  This quote comes from the section about being “realistic”, but it actually
  speaks to me from several places in the book. One of them is on being careful.
  I’ve found that when I’m most cautious, both in work and in my personal life,
  it’s because I fear something. Sometimes it’s a consequence. Sometimes it’s
  judgment from others. Sometimes it’s what the action, or inaction, could mean
  in my future. Kotecki talks about his daughter learning to walk. She falls,
  she bumps, she cries, she gets over it, she explores, she falls, she bumps,
  she cries. It is a seemingly endless cycle but she doesn’t give up and she
  doesn’t fear the next fall or bump. He points out that so many adults give up
  after just one bump or one failure. We lose our resiliency to keep trying
  until we see success.


  I’m a very strategic person. I like to have information, weigh my options, and
  make my decision. I strive to make the “right” decision. In the times where I
  balk at something because I fear making the wrong decision, I hope I will look
  at the problem with childlike creativity and resilience. Realistically, what
  is the worst that can happen? And how would that actually affect me? Is there
  another angle to take to avoid the worst case scenario? If I fail, can I try
  again?

  ### Keep knee jerk reactions at bay


  > "It’s easy to jump into automatic mode in our roles as…leaders and respond
  to situations in the same way we’ve seen other…leaders do it, without ever
  stopping for just a second to question if there might be another way. Stopping
  that knee-jerk reaction is the hard part."- Penguins Can’t Fly, page 78


  If you’ve read many of my summaries, you know that part of my job is to
  oversee social media for a marketing company. Recently, we put out a press
  release about the philanthropic efforts of one of our managers. My social
  media specialist wanted to post it on Facebook. My knee jerk reaction was
  “NOOOOO!” because the philanthropy was affiliated with a religious
  organization. I’ve become sensitive to political correctness. I’ve seen so
  many leaders balk at posting anything that could be considered controversial.
  I wanted to veto that idea right out of the box. But I bit my tongue. We
  posted. At this writing, the post reached over 10,000 people. It has had many
  shares, likes, and extremely positive comments. No one called us out for
  anything negative. Only a handful of recent posts have performed better.


  Kotecki’s section on knee jerk reactions talks about the first time his
  daughter blew milk bubbles with her straw. To fight the urge to tell her to
  stop, Kotecki says he “quickly analyzed the situation: What’s the big deal?
  What are my main concerns?” When those were answered (eat her dinner in a
  reasonable amount of time and don’t clean up milk bubble messes), the milk
  bubbles inadvertently turned into an amazing incentive to for Lucy to eat her
  dinner.


  Stop the knee jerk. Analyze. Evaluate. Take new action. This is what I will
  strive to do. This will also allow me to have a genuine reaction to the
  situation. I think philanthropy is great! Why did I balk so much from the
  post? Because of what other people might think, but from a negative
  perspective. I hadn’t stopped to consider the POSTIIVE reactions we might get.
f_conclusion: >-
  There were so many more things I wanted to write about and other “rules” that
  hit home for me in this book. Each section is short and Kotecki whimsically
  illustrated it himself. It has already been a great “go-to” for stories during
  staff meetings to get my team to think a little differently. Pick up a copy
  and tell me what rules you follow that don’t exist in the comments, even if
  they don’t appear in the book!

Lately, I’ve had a need for FUN books. As you would imagine, _Penguins Can’t Fly: +39 Other Rules that Don’t Exist_ was a fun read. It also encouraged me to pause to think about life and business. Author, speaker, and artist Jason Kotecki is on a mission to rid the world of “adultitis”. Kotecki defines adultitis as the condition that makes us choose to color inside the lines, act based on what others will think, and do things the way they have always been done. He encourages us, in no uncertain terms, to break those rules to live life, and do business, to the fullest.
