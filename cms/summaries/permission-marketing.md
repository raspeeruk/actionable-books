  ### Customer’s Attention Requires Trust


  > "Before a marketer can build trust, it must breed familiarity. But there’s
  no familiarity without awareness."- Permission Marketing, location 792


  _Permission Marketing_ takes the ‘relationships first’ principle from one of
  my other favorite business books, _How to Win Friends and Influence People,_
  and applies it directly to email and digital marketing. And while the book was
  first written in 1999, during the emergence of email marketing, the concepts
  still serve as a strong foundation of all digital engagement and customer
  experience.


  Email is inexpensive, novel and trackable. At the time, this was a greenfield
  for marketers who were struggle to rise above the noise. As the internet
  emerged as a standard tool for business and marketers, Godin tried to break
  the stagnant thinking of an ever present problem with marketers who are
  attempting to adapt traditional tactics to the digital marketplace.


  Godin sets us up by describing a situation where mass media is dying due to
  simply too much noise. Instead, niche media will emerge to match the diverse
  interests and needs of the dynamic marketplace. He also aligns this notion
  with how the marketers mindset needs to evolve to adapt to the more digital
  buyer-centric marketplace. Traditional marketers practice an “interruption
  marketing” mindset, whereas modern marketers practice the “permission
  marketing” mindset.


  One way that marketers can build trust is to choose frequency over reach. In
  doing so, marketers should consider the following tactics:


  *   **Select a focused target audience** — By focusing your budget to a
  specific audience, you can deliver more frequency within a concentrated
  period. An example Godin gives is Muhammad Ali, who became a great fighter by
  punching one opponent twenty times, not by punching twenty opponents one time.

  *   **Varied messaging, similar theme** — Many marketers will try to find a
  gimmicky, clever way to grab the audience’s attention. Like many SuperBowl
  ads, the brand is lost in the advertisement. Instead, Godin believes that
  marketers, having a select target audience, should focus on deeper, more
  relevant messaging for that audience. Coupled with the concentrated frequency,
  the promotions inspire trust.


  *   **Achieving permission** — Permission, the most solidifying factor in
  building a relationship and trust, requires that a marketer consider how their
  customer offers signals to them to leap to the next level. Buying an item,
  signing up for a newsletter, or some level of positive digital engagement are
  all valid reasons to build brand trust.


  Authenticity, relevance, and frequency will allow a brand to open the doors
  for long-term dialogue and profitability through customer retention and
  advocacy.

  ### Farming Over Hunting


  > "Most marketers practice Interruption Marketing. The difference is simple.
  An Interruption Marketer is a hunter. A Permission Marketer is a farmer."-
  Permission Marketing, location 2140


  As much of the book builds on trust and regular engagement, the analogy of
  Godin’s ideal marketer being a farmer makes sense. Hunting prospects as a
  marketer, at the time, had very little cadence and the success less
  predictable. It was inexpensive and required little research. It certainly
  rarely built on trust. The conversation was typically one-sided and very
  little was invested in the relationship after the transaction. Farmers,
  instead, required upfront investment of research, cultivation and planning. It
  would require constant diligence. However, once the prepared farmers became
  accustomed to the tools and environment, the crops (prospects) were a
  perpetual and predictable benefit. This allowed permission marketers to expand
  their farm and grow the company.


  Nurturing relationships through greater segmentation of your audience and
  delivering deeper dialogue with prospects does initially feel like it takes
  time and investment. However, the attention and trust yield higher
  profitability and brand premium.

  ### Dating Your Future Customers


  > "Permission Marketing is just like dating. It turns strangers into friends
  and friends into lifetime customers. Many of the rules of dating apply, and so
  do many of the benefits."- Permission Marketing, location 419


  The book is is all about building relevant relationships. Godin’s dating
  concept applies well to the arena of marketing. Marketers have traditionally
  been delivering one-sided conversations from the company’s own perspective
  without any regard to the interest or reactions of a brand’s audience. Through
  five steps, Godin describes the best way to work toward ‘marriage’.


  1.  **Make an offer** — Every marketer must offer the prospective customer an
  incentive for volunteering their information and your permission to engage
  with them.

  2.  **Provide help** — Using the attention offered by the consumer, the
  marketer offers a curriculum over time, teaching the consumer about the
  product or service he has to offer.

  3.  **Relationship reinforcement** — An incentive has only a certain lasting
  effect. Work to build on that incentive or offer another relevant one.

  4.  **Get serious** — Increase the level of permission the marketer receives
  from the potential customer by asking for more information about them or their
  situation.

  5.  **Get married** — Turn permission into profits and continue to invest in
  the relationship.
f_conclusion: >-
  Seth Godin’s _Permission Marketing_ will remain a classic for decades. As the
  competition for our attention exponentially rises as our attention span
  decreases, permission becomes a powerful asset. In every market segment, only
  a limited number of companies will be able to secure and leverage that
  permission. Another message for consumers is that you are in control and
  dictate who, what, and how you buy. Such a powerful message should bring more
  encouragement to marketers to improve the experience and preserve the trust.
