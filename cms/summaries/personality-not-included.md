  ### Utilize the UAT


  > "Whether you look at Virgin America or any of the Virgin brands, they all
  challenge conventions and stand apart in some way. It really is the perfect
  brand to start helping you understand what your organization’s personality is
  because it is unique, authentic, and talkable."- Personality Not Included,
  page 80


  According to Bhargava, there are three key elements of personality for an
  organization: uniqueness, authenticity, and talkability.


  Bhargava argues that there are four means of creating something unique:


  1.  Find the uncontested space

  2.  Position yourself differently from your competition

  3.  Do something a bit differently

  4.  Think outside your region


  Regarding authenticity, Bhargava believes that the term has achieved
  near-buzzword status, but it is still important. He offers the following
  suggestions for being authentic:


  1.  Have a great backstory

  2.  Be passionate

  3.  Foster individuals

  4.  Care about more than profits


  Of these, I believe that the fourth is the most important in being authentic.
  Profit should not be the goal above all others; instead profit should be one
  of many goals.


  Finally, an idea must be talkable. “If you are only focused on being unique
  and authentic—you will have a great story but with hardly anyone telling it.
  To make your organization more talkable, Bhargava suggests:


  1.  Offering something of value

  2.  Have something that hooks your audience and gets them to share

  3.  Get out of the way


  In other words, embrace people who are talking about your brand by giving them
  something to talk about. And stay out of their way when they start talking.

  ### Tell Your Story


  > "Forget the old ideas of publishing a company history or even an ‘about us’
  page on a Web site."- Personality Not Included, page 105


  A compelling backstory gets people interested. Citing the smash hit television
  show _Lost_, Bhargava argues that one of the primary tools used by the show’s
  writers was the backstory of each character. A backstory is the history behind
  something or someone that explains why they are the way they are. Stories help
  us identify and better understand what someone or something has gone through
  to get to where they are, and a compelling backstory will generate interest
  and empathy.


  Bhargava believes a compelling backstory needs to answer the following
  questions:


  1.  Who are the people in the story?

  2.  What is the key question, need, or challenge they are facing?

  3.  What was their original vision? What caused them to embark upon their
  journey?

  4.  What stands in their way?

  5.  How will (or have) they succeed?


  After answering these questions, you’ll have the foundation for a compelling
  backstory and you can begin to demonstrate your personality.


  Following the steps outlined in personality will help make your marketing more
  compelling and honest, as it relies on spokespeople both in and outside your
  organization to spread your message. It is important to remember that
  personality won’t make up for a faulty idea or product. “Bad ideas don’t get
  better with personality”.

  ### Embrace Your Accidental Spokespeople


  > "The smarter marketers know that the future is about participation and the
  conversation cannot be one-sided. This means that you are not giving up
  control, but sharing it."- Personality Not Included, page 35


  One outcome of Web 2.0 has been the increased power provided to consumers.
  Consumers now control nearly every step of the purchasing process, and an
  unforeseen consequence of this is the rise of the “Accidental Spokesperson.”


  While traditional marketing works with “authorized” spokespeople, Bhargava
  argues that “accidental” spokespeople are just as important to embrace.
  Accidental spokespeople are people who are talking about your brand. Some are
  brand enthusiasts, others are brand detractors. Both are speaking about your
  brand, and both are not authorized to do so.


  Bhargava argues that these accidental spokespeople are key to the successful
  implementation of any marketing plan. However, “accidental spokespeople are
  not relaying official marketing messages”. Instead, they are sharing their
  actual experiences with your brand.


  Marketers frequently interpret this lack of control as a reason to ignore (or
  even silence) their accidental spokespeople. But Bhargava argues that if you
  want to create a personality for your organization or brand, you must embrace
  them by giving them the content and attention they need to tell a compelling
  story. If you embrace your accidental spokespeople, and pay attention to what
  they say, you will receive good advice on what your organization’s personality
  actually is (at least in the eyes of the consumer).

> "Thinking differently requires focusing less on marketing your products and benefits, and more on understanding how to use the personality behind your brand to build a relationship with your customers." _\- Personality Not Included, page 8_

One of the main problems with marketing today it is focused on what Rohit Bhargava and Fred Reicheld refer to as “bad profits.” Bad profits are profits that you earn without regard for customer satisfaction or happiness. _Personality Not Included_ isn’t written for companies only concerned with bad profits. Instead, it is written for companies that “want to be loved instead of liked…iconic instead of ordinary”.

Following up on the notion of the empowered customer, Bhargava argues that it is no longer enough to focus on the benefits your product provides your customers, instead, you must build a relationship of trust with your customers, which, in turn, allows you to stand out from your competitors.

Beyond having an outstanding product, Bhargava argues that the key component of this relationship is the “personality” of your firm.
