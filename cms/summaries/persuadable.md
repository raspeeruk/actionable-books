  ### Respect Flip-Flopping


  > "Sometimes the greatest acts of integrity involve being inconsistent —
  especially when circumstances change, new information comes to light, or
  mistakes have been made. And because the world is changing fast, now more than
  ever, leaders need to be big enough to embrace inconsistency when required."-
  Persuadable, page 69


  Pittampalli references Phillip E. Tetlock’s work which is discussed in more
  detail in
  [_Superforecasting_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/superforecasting/)_._
  Those forecasters who were able to make the best predictions were those who
  changed their mind often. They did not do it haphazardly: they examined the
  evidence on a regular basis and developed a more accurate opinion over time.
  We rarely have all the facts and the ability to evaluate them accurately from
  the start. As a leader ignoring facts as they present themselves may produce
  an image of decisive leadership but give disastrous results because the
  decision followed an inaccuracy.


  Integrity and honesty may be rare in leadership. Perhaps that is because we
  distrust leaders who are honest and change their mind when presented with new
  evidence. We call it flip-flopping. If we change our belief because the
  pursuit of accuracy is more important than any other ideal, it is a display of
  integrity, and we should regard it as a strength rather than a weakness.

  ### Remember to Consider Other Perspectives


  > "All leaders, and people in power, have the ability to excel at
  understanding what the people around them are thinking, accurately identifying
  their positions and interests, if they’re willing to make it a priority. In
  essence, it’s a choice that leaders can make."- Persuadable, page 148-9


  It is natural for us to surround ourselves with information that supports our
  perspective. We must choose to seek others views. To obtain objective
  information that we were not aware of initially and that challenges our point
  of view we must actively solicit the opinion of others, particularly those who
  oppose our favored point of view. Even if we objectively know we should seek
  out opposing views, it is easy to dismiss the contradictory information. To
  avoid this pitfall use a simple, well-proven method for forming an instant
  habit, ask, “When and where will I do X.”


  Decide when and where you will actively seek an understanding of a variety of
  viewpoints. For instance, you choose to listen to a radio show on your way to
  work that opposes your views and decide to consider the alternate view. You
  ask for the viewpoint of colleagues at lunch. You plan to read a newspaper
  column written by a journalist that opposes your opinion. Making a commitment
  in advance to seek others perspectives means we will not forget or miss the
  opportunity.

  ### Use Bayes Logic to Incrementally Update Beliefs


  > "However, what’s most important for Persuadables is the realization that we
  should be incrementally updating our beliefs with evidence. If we do, we have
  a powerful mechanism to develop better and more accurate beliefs about the
  world."- Persuadable, page 111


  Thomas Bayes was a theologian who had an interest in theories of probability.
  He performed a thought experiment where one would imagine a level surface onto
  which a ball was rolled. Without looking at the ball, one would guess its
  location. Its position could be determined by rolling new balls and receiving
  a simple description of where the ball was compared to the new ball. With
  every new ball, one could better predict the position of the ball. Over time
  Bayesian Analysis was formalized, and Pierre-Simon Laplace turned Bayes
  Theorem into a mathematical formula. Using Bayes logic does not require us to
  memorize Laplace’s formula. It’s more practical to simplify and use the Three
  Strikes Rule.


  Bayes Analysis consists of three parts: the prior, evidence, and posterior.
  The prior is the original belief. The evidence is the objective information.
  When the two are combined it produces an updated belief, or posterior, which
  becomes the new prior. The process then repeats. The Three Strikes Rule
  simplifies the logic. If you come across evidence that challenges a view you
  have confidence in think of it as strike one, more evidence is strike two, and
  at strike three you change your opinion. Incrementally updating our beliefs
  gives us a more accurate perspective and increases the effectiveness of our
  decisions.
f_conclusion: >-
  We spend lots of time and money investing in our future success. Success is
  often elusive because our world is full of complexity and uncertainty. We
  invest in our ideas but rarely invest in changing our mind. Often the way we
  think determines our success. Learning to understand what others believe and
  thoughtfully updating our opinion does not cost extra time and money, but it
  may prevent failure. Although we may initially mistrust flip-floppers,
  inconsistency is sometimes the highest form of integrity. Updating our beliefs
  incrementally gives us a more accurate perspective than forming an initial
  opinion and sticking to it. We may initially dismiss information that opposes
  our favored view and need to make an active habit of seeking new perspectives.
  When we decide to become more flexible and open to criticism, we become more
  powerful as leaders.

> “In environments characterized by complexity, uncertainty, and dynamism, it’s impossible to have all the answers. If you want to succeed, you must be prepared to change your mind.” _\- Persuadable, page 9_

Leaders are often expected to conform to the strong leadership archetype displaying confidence, conviction, consistency, and persuasiveness. In _Persuadable: How Great Leaders Change Their Minds to Change the World_, Al Pittampalli shows how influential leaders achieve remarkable results by rejecting the traditional archetype. Through example, he illustrates how persuadability, ability to change their mind when provided with new evidence, is the hallmark of effective leaders.

As followers, we may reject leaders who freely admit they do not have all the answers. How do we know where they stand? We may question a leader that displays humility, who is modest and open to suggestion and willing to change their mind. However, a leader that second-guesses plans and is prepared to accept challenges to ideas exposes weaknesses, resulting in better decisions and better serving those they lead.

Pittampalli was inspired to write _Persuadable_ as a result of his experience. He wrote [_Read This Before Our Next Meeting_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/read-this-before-our-next-meeting/) and received lots of praise and some valuable criticism. He honestly evaluated his book in consideration of the criticism and made substantial changes as a result. He updated his ideas and produced a far more compelling plan that helped leaders do their jobs more efficiently. The changes then became a part of his updated book. He shares his hard-won knowledge and strategy in _Persuadable_.
