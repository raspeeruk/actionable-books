  ### Care and Listen


  > "It’s astonishing how often people go into critically important meetings
  armed with spreadsheets, an impressive track record, and lofty-sounding
  mission statements and promises, yet with no clue what the other party
  actually wants."- Persuasion, page 124


  And how do you figure out what they want? Simply put: caring and listening. If
  you put them first, are interested in them and ask questions such that you
  listen more than you talk, you are sure to discover it!


  Persuasion, Dickinson says, is about connecting; not only wanting what is best
  for the other party but caring enough to find out what it is. This way, you
  achieve an outcome that benefits others while simultaneously attaining your
  goal. The key to this path is caring and listening.


  _“…at least half of what makes you persuasive occurs before you ever even open
  your mouth.”_


  When was the last time you started your effort to persuade with a question?
  Perhaps it’s time to stop telling and start engaging. Find out what is
  important to them and what they want. Make persuasion an interaction, a
  dialogue not a monologue.

  ### Failure


  > "Mistakes are an inevitable part of the equation of achievement."-
  Persuasion, page 229


  An overarching theme throughout _Persuasion_ is the benefit of failure.
  Dickinson writes about her mistakes because they are the most memorable, with
  the greatest learning opportunities, she ruminates.


  How you think about mistakes impacts your success. Dickinson helps us think of
  mistakes as learning opportunities to gain the powerful “growth mindset”. When
  we have this mindset, we believe that intelligence can be transformed through
  effort. We are more likely to keep trying until we succeed.


  For example, while she is arming us with the right attitude and focus to
  persuade, she warns us there will still be failure. The changing dynamics and
  infinite variables when dealing with people make it impossible to create a
  guaranteed successful influential plan.


  The story you tell yourself about mistakes is key. Try to think like:


  *   Henry Ford: _“Failure provides the opportunity to begin again, more
  intelligently.”_

  *   Thomas Edison: “_I didn’t fail one thousand times. The light bulb was an
  invention with one thousand steps.”_

  *   Oprah Winfrey: _“I only got the opportunity to co-host a talk show because
  I had failed at news.”_


  Simply ask yourself “What can I learn from this?” and “How can I improve?” and
  pull up your socks and try again.


  _“If you can stop thinking about your own need for self-gratification, it’s
  much easier to understand what’s driving other people and to figure out how to
  make their goals compatible with yours. At the end of the day, that’s
  persuasion.”  

  _


  And anyone can try it…. In just about any situation in business and life.

  ### Trustworthiness


  > "Trust is the bedrock of ethical persuasion; the other party has to believe
  completely that you have told and always will tell the truth, even when it’s
  difficult."- Persuasion, page 62


  Do you ever feel tempted to shade the truth or lie by omission? (Think “first
  date”!) Arlene urges us to resist at all cost. She describes how your
  reputation is your most valuable asset to persuading others. Think about it.
  You often are asking the other party to deviate from a preconceived notion and
  take a different path, maybe even take a leap of faith. That leap is possible
  only when they feel they can rely on you completely. Even one small
  indiscretion could irreparably damage that trust.


  Arlene shows us that successful persuasion comes from a place of honesty,
  authenticity and reciprocity. Long term, honesty is not only the best policy
  it is also the most persuasive one.

Is ‘Persuasion’ a bad word? Arlene Dickinson (of [_Dragon’s Den_](http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/) fame) doesn’t think so. In fact she equates persuasion with _connecting_ and _caring_. In her book _Persuasion: A New Approach to Changing Minds_ she shares her stories, trials and tribulations that led to her understanding of persuasion as a **partnership**.

Arlene had a less than ideal beginning to her business success. At thirty-one she found herself fighting the battle of her life – for custody of her 4 young children, with only a high school diploma, no savings and no clue of what to do.

She climbed from despair to incredible influence and success. When asked _“How did you do it?”_, her short answer is _“I figured out how and why principled persuasion works._” And she admits it is easy! By the end of her book, you not only feel you too can be persuasive but you can’t wait to apply her lessons!
