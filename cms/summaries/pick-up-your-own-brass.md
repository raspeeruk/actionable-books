  ### The Humble Leader


  > "A good leader always picks up his or her own brass."- Pick Up Your Own
  Brass, Preface, page xii


  Since 1934, FBI agents have carried guns. With this responsibility comes
  regular training and testing sessions where agents, to ensure they are
  qualified to carry a firearm, fire hundreds of rounds of bullets. With
  hundreds of rounds of bullets comes hundreds of casings that are manually or
  automatically ejected from the firearm.


  In FBI terms, a good leader does not expect someone else to pick up these
  casings, they are willing to bend down and pick them up themselves. The
  authors share this lesson in a unique story about a senior executive who
  showed his leadership qualities one day at a firearms training session.


  The visiting FBI executive surprised several of the students when he humbly
  took his place in line, and when he was finished shooting, promptly bent down
  and picked up his own ejected brass casings. Now he did not have to do this,
  he had people around him who would have stepped in and picked them up. But by
  doing so and showing his true character, this FBI executive earned the respect
  and admiration of those in attendance that day.


  As the authors illustrate with this story, the need, as a leader, to
  demonstrate authentic behaviour is a universal one. It does not matter whether
  you are CEO of a corporation or President of a NGO, if you act in your truest
  nature and show authenticity and humility, your ability to lead will resonate
  with those you serve.

  ### Find the Best Talent


  > "Select individuals of courage, integrity, and commitment to lead your
  organization."- Pick Up Your Own Brass, page 7


  In the FBI, most of its leaders are selected from within, groomed and promoted
  through the ranks in a rigorous process that selects agents and other
  professional employees who are perfectly suited to the job at hand.


  This is highly evident in the first pages of _Pick Up Your Own Brass_, as
  McChesney and Gavin recount the story of Sheila Horan – a twenty-two year FBI
  veteran and leader of the FBI’s National Security Division in the Washington,
  D.C. field office – and her actions in the hours and days following news
  reports of two deadly bombings in East Africa.


  As the special agent in charge (or SAC), Sheila Horan, had spent many years
  overseeing foreign counterintelligence cases. To the point she was involved in
  nearly all the FBI’s most sensitive counterintelligence and counterterrorism
  cases. So it was no surprise that when looking for the right person to send to
  East Africa to begin the investigation into the bombings, Sheila was at the
  top of the list. And quick to take on this assignment, seven hours and four
  inoculations later Sheila was on a plane to Nairobi.


  With this story the authors illustrate that unlike those better suited to
  boardrooms and conference calls, leaders of the Bureau must demonstrate a
  serious commitment to flexibility and a readiness to jump in, or fly off, at a
  moment’s notice into situations that may be life threatening. I am not sure I
  would be able to hold up under such intense pressure, would you?


  Now these circumstances are not common among most organizations, but it is
  something interesting to consider. What character traits must you cultivate to
  push you forward in your career, to become the leader you aspire to be?


  Because of what the FBI is required to do as a law enforcement agency, it
  selects individuals with courage, integrity, and commitment to lead their
  organization. If you are unsure what traits you need to be a leader, then pay
  close attention to the 50 lessons offered up by McChesney and Gavin; I’ll bet
  the answers are there.


  So no matter where you are on your career path, an aspiring leader or an
  established one, do yourself a favour and pick up _Pick Up Your Own Brass_ by
  Kathleen McChesney and William Gavin. You won’t be disappointed.

  ### The Root of (Nearly) Every Problem


  > "Ineffective communication is the root of many interpersonal and
  organizational problems."- Pick Up Your Own Brass, page 96


  As a professional in the field, near and dear to my heart is the art of
  effective communication. So I was thrilled to come upon the section so aptly
  named, “The Root of (Nearly) Every Problem” that tackles the idea that
  ineffective communication is the root of many interpersonal and organizational
  problems.


  The ability to clearly convey a message to a specific audience is more
  challenging than most people appreciate. We have all seen an example of this,
  whether it’s a Tweet gone bad or a press conference that quickly disintegrates
  into an ambush. Whatever the circumstance it is always prudent to pay
  attention to everything you say, especially when you are in a position of
  leadership.


  With this in mind, McChesney and Gavin share real stories of how quickly a
  misplaced comment or uninformed remark can affect not just an FBI agent but
  the entire organization.


  One of their colleagues, ‘Geoff’, (recently promoted to a new leadership
  position) stood in his first meeting with a group of senior and junior agents
  and gave (what he felt was) an inspiring speech. Unbeknownst to him, his
  message of loyalty and commitment was received very differently by the senior
  agents than by the junior ones. While the senior agents saw his words as a
  message of commitment, the junior agents felt he demonstrated a lack of
  ambition and was already marking his days to retirement.


  This discrepancy was not mentioned until several months later, when a kind and
  thoughtful former mentor brought up some of the comments that had come back to
  FBI Headquarters. Of course when he heard, ‘Geoff’ was stunned, he had no idea
  his words had left such entirely different impressions among his employees.


  My favourite line was, when ‘Geoff’ asked what he could do to correct the
  situation. His former mentor replied, “that’s easy, go back and tell ‘em what
  you thought you told ‘em.”


  A cool and humbling lesson for us all, that what we say is only half the
  message, it is also what is heard. So the next time you go to make a speech at
  a meeting or just send a text, consider thoughtfully who will be listening, it
  just might change your message.

For years I, like many people, have been fascinated with the FBI. So I was excited to sit down and read Pick Up Your Own Brass and learn more about the leadership qualities of the people at the head of one of the world’s most respected law enforcement agencies, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

With real-life FBI stories as the backdrop, McChesney and Gavin offer 50 leadership lessons throughout the book, listed for easy reference at the end of each section. Easily transferable to anyone’s career aspirations, these lessons from the FBI reveal the qualities and character traits necessary to be a leader in any given situation.

So if you are in search of ways to improve your leadership skills or are in the middle of figuring out what traits you need to cultivate in your own career, then give this a read. If not for the fascinating telling of stories from the mysterious world of the FBI, which I thoroughly enjoyed, than for the enormous wealth of knowledge and insight from these two distinguished special agents.
