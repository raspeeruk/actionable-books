  ### “Wow” Your Customers and Love Your Product


  > "The truth is, mediocrity is natural. You don’t have to do anything to drift
  there. It just happens. But if you want to create truly wow experiences—and if
  you want to create your platform—then it is going to require courage. Are you
  willing to be brave?"- Platform, page 21


  Before you can build a platform, you need to have a product that exceeds
  expectations—“wows” customers—and that you are passionate about.


  Michael therefore spends the first section of his book actually talking about
  the “what” you are trying to sell—the product or service—rather than the
  “how,” since as he explains, unless you have a great product, your platform
  and marketing efforts are doomed anyhow. Wowing customers is necessary to have
  something worth promoting and that others will want to share with their
  friends; being passionate about your own product is necessary so that you can
  become its best spokesperson.


  When you speak about your product, it’s hard to hide your true feelings, so
  wouldn’t you rather it be your passion that comes out? Michael explains how
  Apple’s success is in part thanks to these two factors: they have great
  products that exceeded everyone’s expectations and every time Steve Jobs
  spoke, his passion for their products was evident and therefore more “viral.”

  ### Assemble a “Pit Crew”


  > "In his book Get Off Your ‘But,’ author Sean Stephenson shares the concept
  of assembling a pit crew, as is done in auto racing. This is a helpful
  metaphor for thinking of your professional career. In essence, you are the
  race car driver. Your message or product is the car. You must take
  responsibility for the outcome. But you won’t get far without a pit crew."-
  Platform, page 48


  So you have an awesome product you love and are ready to build your
  platform…but you also need to keep producing the product, running the
  business, writing the content, etc. Where do you start and how do you get it
  all done?


  No one can do everything nor should you attempt to. If you assemble your “pit
  crew,” as Michael recommends, it will allow you to focus on what you alone can
  do while they help you take care of the rest.


  Michael lists the types of help you could potentially invest in:


  1.  Administrative help such as an assistant, bookkeeper, and attorney

  2.  Management help to manage your career (for your speaking engagements)

  3.  Representation help via various types of agents (i.e., literary, booking,
  or publicity)

  4.  Content creation help via coaches or mentors

  5.  And publishers


  Not trying to do it alone is a theme I’ve seen discussed in various books
  recently and one I’ve had to learn myself. Since I still have a “day job” and
  am building a business on the side, after reading similar advice in another
  book, I finally gave in and decided to hire a part-time virtual assistant. It
  was well worth the investment and I recommend it highly if you’re in a similar
  situation.

  ### Think Big


  > "While you are preparing to launch, consider your mental attitude. If you’re
  going to be the chief marketing officer for your wow product, you must think
  bigger than you have ever before."- Platform, page 36


  We all know that our thoughts and beliefs have power, but Michael discovered
  that thinking big is the number one characteristic shared by all successful
  creatives. After reading _The Magic of Thinking Big_ by David Schwartz, he
  taught himself how to develop this skill through the below steps:


  1.  Imagine the impossible

  2.  Write down your dreams

  3.  Connect with what is at stake

  4.  Outline what would have to be true

  5.  Decide what you can do to affect the outcome

  6.  Determine when this will happen

  7.  Review your goals daily


  Number 2 has its own power. Writing things down, as Michael explains, is what
  “transforms a dream into a goal.” He has first-hand experience with the magic
  behind putting your wishes to paper and describes another example from the
  book _Write it Down, Make it Happen_ by Henriette Anne Klasuer: Lou Holz wrote
  all his goals in 1966, when he was broke and unemployed and his wife was about
  to have their third child. These goals included impossible things like having
  dinner at the White House and meeting the pope. Apparently he’s completed 102
  of his original 107 goals—including those two “impossible” ones.


  Although all this may sound implausible and be hard to believe, Michael’s
  seven-step approach is really just a way to plan and execute on the goals you
  commit to. The writing and the steps outlined are a means to this end and a
  way to get you focused and actually progressing. Either way, you lose nothing
  by giving this approach a try and have the world to gain if it succeeds.
f_conclusion: >-
  Regardless of what your professional goals are, chances are that having a
  platform will help you achieve it. Given all the social media options out
  there, it may seem overwhelming but Michael Hyatt has experience with it all
  and teaches us what to do every step of the way. There are chapters on how to
  set-up your home base (via blogging or website); how to extend your reach (via
  social media); and then how to build your tribe (to get more comments and
  engagement). All this is done in easy-to-read short chapters with lots of
  lists, so you can quickly refer back to anything you’ve forgotten. I highly
  recommend the book and have several to-do’s I’ve marked to try.
f_quote-2: >-
  "More than four centuries ago, William Shakespeare wrote, ‘All the world’s a
  stage,’ and his words are truer today than ever before. If you have something
  to say—through a blog, a seminar, a book, a song, a screenplay, a sermon, or a
  stage play—you are on stage. If you have something to sell—whether one-on-one,
  before a huge crowd, or on the Internet—you are also on a stage. "

I have been following Michael Hyatt’s blog for years now. Not only was he one of the first CEOs to start blogging, but he was also in the same industry as I was (publishing), so I wanted to read what he had to say. He has since stepped down from his role at Thomas Nelson Publishers and spends his time sharing his insights via his blog, books, and public speaking. His latest book, _Platform: Get Noticed in a Noisy World_ is him generously giving us the step-by-step plan to build our own platform, with all his years of experience and hard-won lessons included.

Do you have an existing platform? What’s its purpose and where do you think you could use more help?
