  ### Overcome the Internal Barriers


  > "Centuries of women’s exclusion from political, public, and professional
  life have had many effects. Some of these effects were external. But
  inequality of men and women has also left internal effects in us."- Playing
  Big, page xxv


  The conversation about workplace inequality is typically about external
  barriers to women. This includes legislation, formal policies, pay
  disparities, lack of legal protections, and the denial of women’s basic
  rights. But what Mohr is suggesting is that even though the playing field is
  not completely even, women can advance more by focusing on the internal
  barriers. The internalized oppression that women experience is a result of
  years of external oppression. Mohr suggests that it has also shaped how we
  think of ourselves and what we see as possible for our lives and work. The
  core practices and ideas in _Playing Big_ all come from this basic idea.


  Mohr’s goal is to help women work through their internalized oppression and
  barriers. _Playing Big_ is the result of years of this type of coaching that
  Mohr has provided to women, and what she outlines in the book are many
  practical ideas and tips for women to independently work through their
  barriers. Read on for two.

  ### At Some Point, We Have to Leap


  > "Leaps get us playing bigger right now."- Playing Big, page 165


  For all of the inner work that we might do to help ourselves prepare to play
  big, at some point we have to actually start playing big. Mohr suggests this
  requires us to leap from where we are to playing big.


  A leap, according to Mohr, meets six criteria:


  1.  It gets you playing bigger now, according to what that means for you.

  2.  It can be finished within one to two weeks.

  3.  It’s a simple, action phrase (i.e. to apply to three jobs in your desired
  field).

  4.  It gets your adrenaline flowing because a leap stretches you outside your
  comfort zone.

  5.  A leap puts you in contact with the audience you want to reach or
  influence.

  6.  You leap with intent to learn.

  ### Befriend Your Inner Critic


  > "You simply need to learn how to live with the inner voice of self-doubt but
  not be held back by it, to hear the voice and not take direction from it."-
  Playing Big, page 3


  Although we may not talk about it often, we all have a voice in our minds that
  is often our biggest critic. “We are so used to living with this voice, most
  of us don’t imagine it could be otherwise,” she writes. Mohr suggests the key
  problem with the voice of our inner critic is that we do not separate
  ourselves from this voice. In other words, we see this voice and its narrative
  as a direct reflection of who we really are. But that’s simply not the case.
  The problem with our inner critic is that often we let that voice take the
  wheel and make our decisions. Mohr suggests a few practices for managing our
  inner critic:


  *   **Label and notice** – When you start hearing your inner critic, pause and
  notice it. Specifically, recognize that it is your inner critic.

  *   **Separate the “I” from the inner critic** – Recognize that your inner
  critic is struggling, not you.

  *   **Compassionately see your inner critic’s motives** – When you hear the
  voice of self-doubt, try to understand what your critic is trying protect you
  from. What are the real intentions behind their words?

  *   **Have a sense of humor** – Sometimes the best way to manage our inner
  critic is with a sense of humor. Is there something absurd or funny about what
  the critic is telling you?
f_conclusion: >-
  Mohr offers immense advice for women who want to play big in their lives and
  careers. I think it’s one of the most practical and useful personal
  development books that I’ve read in recent years. For women who are ready to
  make a change in their lives, this is a must read.

It is no mystery that there is gender inequality in our society. This inequality is especially evident in the workplace. But for all of the ways that women have advanced in society, why does workplace inequality persist? This question and more about women’s leadership has been a core concern for Tara Mohr. In her book _Playing Big_, Mohr explores this issue in depth and also offers women concrete advice for stepping into leadership roles.

To Mohr, playing big means living with great freedom to express your voice and pursue your aspirations. Even though we are all aware of this potential, Mohr couldn’t help but notice that many women were denying it in themselves. “You are that talented woman who doesn’t see how talented she is.” _Playing Big_ is Mohr’s solution to recognizing and owning our talent, and living a more fulfilling life. Mohr walks readers through a process of understanding our barriers to playing big (i.e. our Inner Critic), tuning into our inner wisdom, working through fear, communicating with power, finding our calling and embracing ease. _Playing Big_ is a comprehensive guide for women who want to make big changes in their life and career.
