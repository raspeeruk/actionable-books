  ### Take Action


  > "The job isn’t to catch up to the status quo. The job is to invent the
  status quo."- Poke the Box, Seth Godin, Preface (Kindle version)


  And there it is – two lines beating with the unison of one heart.


  All of Seth’s ideas, passions, even his personal successes, irrevocably point
  to this one statement. Regardless of how you reach a position which allows you
  to reinvent the status quo – whether it be through permission marketing, an
  [ideavirus](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/unleashing-the-ideavirus/),
  [tribes](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/tribes/), selling the [purple
  cow](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/purple-cow/) or by being a
  [linchpin](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/linchpin/) – it pays to take
  the plunge and start something you think is new and exciting.


  Forget what the others have to say about it. Go, do it, now. If you fail,
  fine, do it again and be prepared to succeed. If you fail again, iterate –
  until you succeed.

  ### No Shortcuts


  > "The easiest way may be the best plan in the short run, but it certainly
  doesn’t work for the long haul. In the short run, playing your strongest
  player, following the play-book, rewarding someone who has done it before –
  these are all great ways to win. In the long run, though, all you’ve done is
  taught conformity and punished initiation."- Poke the Box, page 48 (Kindle
  version)


  A word to all managers, this quote should be framed and hung on the wall of
  your office. Stifling creativity isn’t exactly new (Emperor Shah Jahan of
  medieval India buried alive the artisans who built the Taj Mahal), but in
  today’s day and age it’s foolish and fatal.


  As Seth points out repeatedly in all his output, the age of the factory is
  over – rote, routine, mindless tasks are not only unwelcome, but ultimately
  self-defeating. The new economy will be driven by ideas, and if stifling
  creativity aborts ideas then it will end up aborting businesses too,
  regardless of how old or new they are.


  In short, there really is no way to summarize this book without doing it some
  form of injustice. I wish I could quote half (or all of) this book in this
  summary, but I won’t.


  All I can advise is to read the book. It’s well worth it. And if that’s not
  enough for you, try the free _Poke the Box_
  [workbook](http://thedominoproject.com/_/PoketheBox_Workbook.pdf) as well –
  it’s packed with tips, exercises and workarounds to get your juices and
  humours flowing the right way.


  Go. Start poking.

  ### Curiosity Wins


  > "Every once in a while I’ll perform an illusion or some technical shortcut
  and someone won’t ask how. People have been indoctrinated so completely by
  their jobs that they don’t want to know how something works, they’re willing
  to accept that perhaps the laws of nature don’t work as they expect, and by
  the way, can I have the remote? Initiative is a little like creativity in that
  both require curiosity. Not the search for the “right answer”, as much as an
  insatiable desire to understand how something works and how it might work
  better. The difference is that the creative person is satisfied once he sees
  how it’s done. The initiator won’t rest until he does it."- Poke the Box, page
  23 of 83 (Kindle version)


  Did you want me to elaborate? Ah what the hell, here’s another one:


  “Imagine that the world had no middlemen, no publishers, no bosses, no HR
  folks, no one telling you what you couldn’t do.


  If you lived in that world, what would you do?


  Go. Do that.”


  I hope you’re seeing the point. No matter how many times you read this quote,
  it starts with igniting that fire in your belly and going on a journey to find
  out “why?”. Until you find something that gets you sitting on the edge of your
  seat, burning with curiosity and filling you with eagerness to give it your
  best shot, you haven’t really gone anywhere yet.

Like dynamite, Red Bull and Muhammad Ali, Seth Godin’s books pack a powerful punch and need to be treated with respect. This book in particular should be consumed in one of the two following ways:

1.  Either you swallow it whole, shovelling all the irregular verbs down your oesophagus and washing it down with a nice glass of Seth’s fluid prose, OR
2.  You nibble at the book slowly, taking little bites, chewing carefully and methodically in order to make sure that each and every iota of an idea is digested to the fullest.

Regardless of your method of consumption, take care to remember that Seth’s books are best appreciated for what they do to you as you progress through them.

As I read _Poke The Box_ at 3am on a Friday night, I got the sense that I was riding a new wave crest in the sea of Seth’s ideas; if [_Linchpin_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/linchpin/) was the manifesto that tied together all of his ideas from over the last ten years, _Poke The Box_ is the manifesto of manifestos, or more precisely, the manifesto to push (not teach) people to act on all the information they’ve been given over the last ten years.

Released as part of _The Domino Project_, a bold new collaboration with [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Poke-Box-Seth-Godin/dp/1936719002) that seeks to reinvent the nature of publishing and turn the conventional wisdom on its head, _Poke the Box_ is the next instalment in the Seth Godin adventure that began with _Permission Marketing_ more than a decade ago.

To “poke to the box” is to take initiative and try – regardless of looming possibility of fear, ridicule or ostracism. Too many hard-working, good people seem to either run away from taking initiative, or worse, sit on their ideas for so long that they fail to act on them in time (“Fail to ship” as Seth frequently quips). By **naming our problem**, we can identify it and work around it, eventually eliminating it.

Although written as a long list of seemingly disconnected ideas loosely-linked with anecdotes, examples, quotes and aphorisms that illustrate the “ayes” of taking action and the “nays” of inaction, _Poke The Box_ is, in reality, a great motivational tool. It may not be the best of Seth’s books to-date, but nonetheless, like sugar-coated honey-roasted almond & chocolate marshmallow bites, it causes a rush of blood to head and positive feel-good vibes that last throughout the day. More importantly, it’s a book that takes less than an hour to consume but several times longer to digest – leading to the slow-release of the idea that anything and everything that is potentially productive and efficacious should be tried, if only for the its own sake.
