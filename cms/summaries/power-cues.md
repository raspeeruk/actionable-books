  ### Your Body Speaks to Me


  > "We learn at a very early age that conversation is a pas de deux, a game
  that two (or more) people play that involves breathing, winking, nodding, eye
  contact, head tilts, hand gestures, and a whole series of subtle nonverbal
  signals that help both parties communicate the with one another."- Power Cues,
  page 153


  One reason that our unconscious constantly reads the nonverbal cues of others
  goes back to the idea of fight or flight. While survival is no longer at
  stake, our brains still look for cues to identify friend or foe, who is in
  power, who is aligned with us, and who might be telling the truth versus
  lying. Unconsciously, we are always reading the people around us. Morgan
  identifies this reading as our gut feeling or intuition.


  From the friend or foe perspective, friendly people will communicate with
  openness. They’ll have wide, open eyes, turn their torso toward you, and use
  smiles and nods. Conversely, someone that is disengaged communicates with
  crossed arms that block the torso or bodies turned slightly away. Moving
  nearer someone indicates friendliness or connection while moving away can
  indicate hostility or simply that it’s time to end the conversation. People
  that are lying tend to turn slightly away to create distance. More subtly,
  liars may have their torso turned toward you but because they are trying to
  deceive you their legs and feet may show what is really happening and be
  turned away.

  ### Let Me Hear You Say It


  > "People sort themselves out in terms of power very quickly after they meet,
  within minutes and unconsciously, and they signal that power relationship to
  each other with their low-frequency vocal patterns. It further shows that you
  can shift the pattern if you can come on strong at the end or even work on
  your vocal production to be powerful from the start."- Power Cues, page 126


  One of the most interesting and unexpected parts of the book was how sound,
  frequency, and resonance could make a difference in leadership and
  communication. What Morgan called a thin, nasally voice sounds weak. A
  thicker, deeper voice is more acoustically pleasing; we want to listen to what
  that person has to say because we align the sound with power. Breathing is a
  big part of voice. Morgan says that most of us sit at a desk, which impedes
  proper breathing. If your shoulders rise and fall, you aren’t filling your
  lungs properly. Rather, stand up and take in a breath by expanding your belly
  outward and keeping your shoulders still. Contract your abdominals as you
  exhale, pushing the breath out. Practicing this type of breathing has health
  benefits and is the beginning of finding your leadership voice.


  Morgan also reminds readers that eliminating speaking tics like over use of
  the catch phrase “you know” or lots of “ums” helps develop a strong leadership
  voice. Creating awareness of the tics is really the key. Videotaping yourself
  to count your own tics or having someone watch you speak and count or point
  out the tics are a couple of examples. If awareness isn’t enough, some people
  need the incentive of donating to charity each time they let an “um” slip
  through.

  ### Show Me to the Stage


  > "Few of the places we speak have great sight lines, perfect acoustics, and
  comfortable seating for the audience. We’re usually working with
  less-than-prime conditions. So it helps to be ready for most of the
  possibilities. In other words, be ready to answer the question, 'how will I
  use this room to my advantage and work the crowd?' with minimal stress and
  uncertainty."- Power Cues, page 168


  While only a fraction of communication happens from a stage, public speaking
  could be the most important arena for some of the greatest influence that you
  have in business. Morgan gives tips on how to prepare your message to connect
  with your audience. He identifies four areas to keep in mind: **influence**,
  **mimicry**, **activity**, and **consistency**. When you are asked to give a
  message, you have some automatic influence because you have been identified as
  an expert on your topic but it’s important to use your time to say what
  matters. There is power in pauses, silence, and well thought out talking
  points. Mimicry is the act of mirroring and getting your audience to mirror
  you. Giving the audience a word or phrase to repeat is a way to build mimicry
  into your message. Activity relates to the level of energy that you bring to
  the message and is often linked to how easy it will be to get your audience to
  mimic you and show their alignment. Consistency is controlling your emotions
  and energy throughout the message or conversation. If something unexpected
  happens, it’s important not to get flustered and let it throw off your words
  or body language. At the same time, you should consider when to let your
  passion and energy flare up. A bit of controlled inconsistency in that regard
  can have a huge impact.

  While I didn’t love the writing style of the author, I got a lot out of this
  book. Regardless of how much your daily life or occupation requires you to
  deliver messages to groups of people, we all constantly communicate with the
  people around us. There’s no doubt that you can benefit from learning what
  power cues will make your life as a leader easier and more natural. Since I
  couldn’t fit all the gems in here, which of Nick Morgan’s _Power Cues_ will
  help you to lead more naturally and influence those around you?

  "Modern brain research puts us in touch with a far more powerful understanding
  of the way that humans communicate than we’ve had before. We are hard-wired to
  join up and communicate together through our unconscious minds. Our
  evolutionary past necessitated this confluence of communication, and we need
  to get in touch with it again in order to realize the full power of influence
  an individual can have over a group."

For the past decade, my job has involved public speaking in a variety of forms. Over the years, I have picked up tips on nonverbal cues to improve my ability to deliver content but never so many aspects of communication and interaction all in one place. Speaking coach Nick Morgan talks about using what he calls power cues to make leadership more natural based on the way our brains read the subtleties of communication. Gesture, voice resonance and tonality, the amount of space you take up in a room, and storytelling can impact the influence you have over your audience. It comes down to learning to control the nuances of the communication dance to make it a little more elegant. The best speakers make it look easy to engage on stage, show charisma and concern, and ignite their followers with passion. In _Power Cues_, Morgan gives you tools to dance the dance.

Each chapter covers one of Morgan’s power cues, brain research behind it, how you might apply it in your interactions with others, and field notes that sometimes serve as a more in depth look at implementation.
