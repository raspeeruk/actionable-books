  ### Made for Collaboration


  > "The more good partnerships you have in your life, the more likely you are
  to say that you experienced the feeling of enjoyment much of the day
  yesterday, that you recently learned something interesting, and that you’ve
  been doing a lot of smiling and laughing – all key measures of your
  happiness."- Power of 2, page 4


  Human beings are made for relationships. From the dawn of time, we’ve used
  each other as hunting and gathering buddies, as companionship and extra muscle
  on long voyages and confidants in the face of trouble from wolves or bosses.
  With few exceptions, we can’t do it alone and need to depend on the strengths
  of someone else to complement our own skills. According to the research
  conducted by Wagner and Muller, successful partnerships can be broken down
  into eight elements:


  1.  Complementary strengths

  2.  A common mission

  3.  Fairness

  4.  Trust

  5.  Acceptance

  6.  Forgiveness

  7.  Communicating

  8.  Unselfishness


  Successful partnerships don’t just happen – they contain a common set of
  characteristics that define them. Whether they had a joint mission to cure
  cancer, scale Everest or send tourists into space, across all disciplines and
  genres, the insights gained from the research into these successful
  partnerships allow us to make the most out of our collaborative relationships.

  ### Forgiveness


  > "The same emotional wiring that makes great partnerships so effective and
  rewarding creates corresponding and equally powerful negative forces if things
  go wrong."- Power of 2, page 118


  When partnerships are going well, all sorts of amazing things happen – each
  partner makes unselfish choices for the good of the whole, sacrifices are made
  to advance the success of the other, and things are accomplished that would
  have been virtually impossible without the complementary strength of the
  partnership. But what happens when that relationship turns ugly?


  Trust is the cornerstone of every successful partnership and when one partner
  violates that trust, it can turn into a game of negative comeuppance,
  “irrationally” fuelling the desire for revenge. Scientists have discovered
  that the part of the brain that recognizes pleasure is the same part that also
  recognizes revenge. So we can’t help it, right? Wrong. We’re rational
  creatures with the capacity for reason, understanding and yes, forgiveness.
  But, as Wagner and Muller tell us, there is no perfect answer. One of the most
  difficult things a partner may have to decide is whether or not to repair a
  partnership when trust has been violated. The most constructive strategies
  suggest finding a middle ground between resentment and forgiveness, voicing
  the concerns and feelings regarding the situation, and either agreeing on a
  solution or agreeing to disagree. “_How you manage your own thinking is as
  important as the offense itself_.”


  Being a good partner requires you to check your ego at the door, make
  accommodations you likely wouldn’t make otherwise and possess a degree of
  diplomacy and humility not seen (or required) in other situations. You must be
  aware of those around you and look for those with strengths complementary to
  your own, for, when combined with your developmental opportunities, you will
  be happier, achieve greater heights than you thought possible and most
  importantly, “_you will not stand alone on those summits_.”

  ### Partner Up


  > "Behind this phenomenon is a principle: Build on your strengths. To mitigate
  your weaknesses – and we all have them – partner up! Find your complement."-
  Power of 2, page 10


  Where would Sherlock Holmes have been without Dr. Watson? One man was great at
  sleuthing and solving the mysteries and the other man was great at reason,
  responsibility and bailing the other out of trouble. Each man had his own
  strengths and his weaknesses (or “developmental opportunities” as my Dad calls
  them) and was complemented by the strengths of the other. This is the key to a
  successful partnership – finding that person who can pick-up where you left
  off, can take those tasks and activities you’re not as awesome at and complete
  them in a way you couldn’t. Not to say the Holmes couldn’t get himself out of
  trouble every once in a while, but he definitely wouldn’t do it as easily or
  as often if he didn’t have Watson to support him.


  Consider a moment when you’ve felt particular satisfaction for a job well done
  or accomplishing a task you’d been working on for a while. Was there someone
  else involved in that success? Chances are that in many of our jobs, our
  personal relationships, our volunteer endeavours and even our church or
  spiritual families, success comes easiest, and often best, when those efforts
  are complemented by another.

Mickey and Minnie. Ben and Jerry. Bill and Melinda. Neither is as strong without the other and – very likely – neither would be as successful individually as they were as part of the pair. Intuitively, we know this and have witnessed these successes, but in their book, _Power of 2_, authors Rodd Wagner and Gale Muller use extensive research to prove that intuition. Over the span of five years, Wagner and Muller set out to _“crack the code on collaboration_” (page 7); to discover why some partnerships are better than others and what characteristics define successful collaborative relationships.
