  ### Shift Your Practice Paradigm


  > "Practice, in this framework, is perhaps defined not as a series of drills
  and activities and scrimmages but as the opportunity to invent or reinvent
  ourselves in whatever way we wish, by repeatedly doing these activities with
  strategy and intentionality."- Practice Perfect, page 204


  Practice often carries a negative connotation. Many people view practice as an
  unnecessary hurdle to clear before a performance. Rather than view practice as
  a tedious task, the authors suggest readers shift their paradigms to allow for
  a more expansive definition. This kind of practice is different than mere
  repetition. **The goal is not to repeat an activity for a period of time, but
  to deliberately focus on a few isolated elements that will improve the
  finished product.**


  To generate effective practice sessions, specificity and detail are king. By
  avoiding generic descriptions and replacing them with specific activities, you
  can use practice to improve. For example, rather than work on a board
  presentation, instead plan to practice your board presentation with a coworker
  who asks a list of anticipated questions you want to be able to answer. The
  latter produces specific results. While this level of focus requires a greater
  commitment from you, the long-term gains will outshine the extra work.


  **Who should practice?** Everyone. The salesperson who wants to close more
  sales, the manager preparing to give performance reviews, the rookie who has
  to present to the committee. Practice is not just for junior varsity players
  and aspiring musicians, but anyone who is interested in improving a skill or
  ability. You can practice preparing your company’s quarterly budget, how to
  plan your day, or even cleaning the garage.


  Perhaps the greatest benefit of practice is it allows you to “encode success.”
  What does winning look like for this endeavor? You want to have better staff
  meetings? Think about what those would look like and then work to practice the
  necessary components. **Practice doesn’t have to involve a stopwatch and a
  whistle.** That is the appeal of a broader definition of practice: it can be
  molded to help you improve in a specific area.

  ### Make practice fun


  > "Who plays golf by raking one ball after another into the same place while
  hitting with the same club? Nobody, right? So why do people practice like
  that?"- Practice Perfect, page 155


  Perhaps the ill will most people feel toward practice is its association with
  a sense of obligation and monotony as opposed to an opportunity to improve? By
  improving the way you practice through engineering it to replicate how you
  actually use the skills, it will become more effective and helpful, and
  chances are good it will be a lot less boring too.


  UCLA basketball coach and advocate of harnessing practice to improve, John
  Wooden observed, “Work without joy is drudgery. Drudgery does not produce
  champions, nor does it produce great organizations.” So why is practice set up
  that way? As the authors point out, **“Practice should not be a punishment.”**


  Do something to liven up practice, and people will be more willing to buy into
  your new paradigm of practice.

  ### Practice giving specific and actionable feedback


  > "Saying, You did that well. Great job! is nice. It motivates and inspires
  people. But we tend to think that's it, that positive feedback motivates
  people by making them feel good. Ironically, that may be the weakest part of
  positive feedback."- Practice Perfect, page 121


  **Feedback is a crucial element of practice.** While the act of analyzing
  performance and determining what one can do better is good, it only solves
  part of the practice problem. Specific and actionable feedback provides the
  greatest value to the recipient. For example, your boss tells you to keep
  doing what you are doing, the project looks great, or a leader instructs her
  team that they need to give their all on this upcoming project—what is your
  all? **Instead of telling someone to keep it up, explain precisely what “it”
  is, and how he could improve.** The second example leaves the person with an
  idea of what he is doing well, how to replicate it and where else that skill
  may be beneficial.


  Feedback should play a larger role if practice is to serve as a catalyst for
  improvement in your organization.


  To assist in your feedback makeover the authors suggest building three
  statements into your feedback:


  1\. A statement of **identification**, “help them to see what they did
  right.”  

  2\. A statement of **application**, “help them to do it again.”  

  3\. A statement of **reapplication**, “help them to see new settings in which
  to apply their skill.”


  In the future rather than telling your team to keep it up, construct your
  feedback from these three statements to make the feedback “a major muscle
  group of improvement.”

Contrary to an idiomatic expression, practice doesn’t result in perfection. Think about it, you shampoo your hair daily and have been doing so for decades. Yet, when was the last time your skill improved? How much closer to a perfect shampoo technique are you today than you were a year ago?

_Practice Perfect_, by Doug Lemov, Erica Wollway, and Katie Yezzi, sets out to address how you can use practice to improve. Specifically, the book outlines forty-two rules for getting better at getting better. While the primary audience is educators, the principles are universally applicable.

Do something to liven up practice, and people will be more willing to buy into your new paradigm of practice.

“Deliberately engineered and designed, practice can revolutionize our most important endeavors.”

Start from where you are, and if you are not practicing, begin. If you are practicing, reengineer your practices to incorporate actionable feedback. But above all, make practice fun, something that will help you practice again tomorrow.

This alternative practice paradigm has helped me move from rereading my class notes Friday afternoon to simulating a mini exam; a change that forces me to break down the ideas covered throughout the week. By grading my answers I can see which concepts I’ve yet to grasp and reflect those needed topics in my study plans for the following week. While I am still working on making law school “fun”, I will say I prefer this approach to reading through notes without any sense of improvement.

How you could improve with a new paradigm of practice?
