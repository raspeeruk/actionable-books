  ### Ethics - Pre-Pre-Suasive Foundation


  > "Do not seek dishonest gains, dishonest gains are losses."- Hesiod,
  Pre-Suasion, page 214


  We all know that the most important part of building a house is creating a
  solid foundation. Trust is the strong foundation upon which successful
  influence is built. When customers and employees can trust the ethics of an
  organization, they are more likely respond to an organization’s influence.


  Cialdini offers three recommendations that he believes all organizations
  should adopt:


  1.  Employees incentive structures should include honesty ratings by clients.

  2.  The ethical reputation of the company as a whole should be measured and
  included in assessments of yearly performance.

  3.  Senior management’s (and especially the CEO’s) compensation packages
  should have a component of ratings of the firm’s ethical orientation by
  employees.


  By focusing attention on ethics, an organization can elevate the perception of
  trust, and ultimately become more influential. Sounds like an ideal win/win!

  ### When and Where—Important Considerations


  > "It is possible to learn scientifically established techniques that allow
  any of us to be more influential."- Pre-Suasion, page 12


  To illustrate the power of timing, Cialdini shares the story of how his
  publication deadline was pushed back by a year. While he was preparing to go
  to another university for a semester to work on his book, the dean of the
  school called. He described the wonderful office he had for Cialdini, the new
  computer, staff support etc. Cialdini was pleasantly surprised. It was even
  better than he expected.


  Then came the ask. One of the professors was ill. Would Cialdini mind teaching
  just one class? He immediately saw his precious writing time slip away as he
  pictured all the time needed to prepare, teach, and work with the students.
  Yet he said yes. Why? On reflection, he realized it was classic influence. The
  Dean had offered the favor of an unexpected and delightful surprise. So when
  he asked for a favor in return, he had to say yes.


  But as Cialdini reflected, he realized that had the Dean called the next day,
  he would have graciously declined. It was all in the timing. The most powerful
  reciprocation effect is immediately after the favor. As time passes, its
  potency declines.


  To illustrate the power of your environment, Cialidini describes his challenge
  writing for a general, rather than an academic audience. He had two desks from
  which he would write; one in his office at the university with shelves of
  professional books and a fabulous view of imposing scholarly buildings. The
  other desk was in his apartment with a view onto an ordinary city street,
  filled with ordinary people doing any of a thousand ordinary things.


  From which desk do you think he had greater success writing for a general
  ‘layman’ audience? Yup! His desk in the city. There the background cues in his
  physical environment guided his thoughts and helped him think from the
  perspective of his audience.


  I work with pharmaceutical professionals, helping them be patient-focused
  influencers who partner with healthcare professionals to create better patient
  outcomes. So it makes sense that I should encourage my clients to have
  pictures of patients in their offices (action shots rather than head shots
  work better), videos of patient stories to watch, or podcasts about patient
  outcomes to listen to each day.

  ### A Baker’s Dozen Ideas


  > "Unfortunately, the great majority of scientific data on persuasion goes
  unused by practitioners – even valuable findings such as this."- Pre-Suasion,
  page 81


  _Pre-Suasion_ includes countless examples for how to influence behavior. Here
  is a baker’s dozen of ideas for you to use. One of these is **not true**.
  **Which one?**


  **If we want them to:Then we should first:**Buy a box of expensive chocolates


  Arrange for them to write a much larger number than the price of the
  chocolates


  Choose a bottle of French wine


  Expose them to French background music before they decide


  Agree to try an untested product


  Ask whether they consider themselves adventurous


  Do better on a math exam (high school senior females)


  Ask them to record and reflect on their year (but not their gender), and have
  female monitors instead of male


  Feel warmly toward us


  Hand them a cold drink


  Be more helpful to us


  Have them look at photos of individuals standing close together


  Be more achievement oriented


  Provide them with an image of a runner winning a race


  Make careful assessments


  Show them a picture of August Rodin’s _The Thinker_


  Trust us


  Reference the weakness of your offer or idea up front


  Deepen their loyalty


  Ask them to recommend your brand to a friend


  Be helpful


  Ask them first if they consider themselves to be a helpful person


  Change a behavior (e.g. lose weight)


  Create _If/when… then_ plans (e.g. _When_ I’m hungry at 2pm, _then_ I will
  reach for an apple)


  Gain interest in your presentation or article


  Begin it with a mystery


  So did it work? Did posing the mystery up front (i.e. “Which one is not
  true?”) engage you?


  The answer of course, is number 5: If you want someone to feel warmly towards
  you, give them a **warm** drink, not a cold one.
f_conclusion: >-
  Surprisingly, Cialdini tells us, some of the behavioral science researchers
  have never seen implications of their amazing studies put into practice. What
  a pity. These researchers are doing great work – showing us better ways to
  influence. We just need to put that learning into action!

> “The best persuaders become the best through pre-suasion – the process of arranging for recipients to be receptive to a message before they encounter it.” _\- Pre-Suasion, page 4_

One of the most dog-eared books on my shelf is [_Influence_](https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X/ref=zg_bs_2700_3) by Dr. Robert Cialdini. Published in 1984 and translated into 30 languages with over 30 million copies sold, this book brought science to the art of persuasion.

So you can imagine how thrilled I was to discover that his sequel, [_Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade_](https://www.amazon.com/Pre-Suasion-Revolutionary-Way-Influence-Persuade/dp/1501109790/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8) carries on where [_Influence_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/influence-the-psychology-of-persuasion/) left off. It expands on his six principles of influence known widely known by influence experts as RASSCL:

R- Reciprocity  
A – Authority  
S – Scarcity  
S – Social Proof  
C – Consistency  
L – Liking

This time Cialdini provides the science-based evidence of not just _what_ to say to persuade but also _when_ best to say it. Like good gardeners who realize that even the finest of seeds will not grow in poorly prepared soil, good influencers realize they must ready the person to ensure the seeds of influence will grow.

Even though Cialdini has popularized the science of persuasion and is among the most cited social psychologist of our time, the majority of scientific data on persuasion strangely goes unused. I’ve provided just a sampling of this research below.

There are so many other tips and ideas in Pre-suasion. If influencing others is key to your success, you are missing out, not using these proven tips. Which one will you apply?

There’s a world of science behind influence just waiting for you to discover! Thank you Dr. Cialdini for opening that door!
