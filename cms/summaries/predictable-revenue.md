  ### Create an outbound sales team for predictable revenue


  > "The \[outbound sales team\] has a single mission: to generate…new qualified
  sales opportunities from cold companies (ones that have no activity or
  interest) and passing these qualified opportunities to quota-carrying
  salespeople to close."- Predictable Revenue, page 12


  Do you actually need an outbound sales team? That might be the first question
  that you ask yourself if you’re an entrepreneur or an established leader in a
  business. If you need some direction, ask yourself these two questions:


  1.  Are people involved in the process of finding new clients?

  2.  Are your customers worth more than $5,000 to you? (It can work for smaller
  amounts but it will be harder for you to make it profitable.)


  According to the authors, if you fit within the above criteria, you should be
  at least looking into creating an outbound sales team. Typical sales teams are
  structured with a team of sales people who often do a mix of prospecting,
  qualifying, closing, and relationship management. Account Executives (or
  quota-carrying salespeople) are often the most high-priced salespeople on the
  team. They’re responsible for a wide variety of tasks and must be excellent at
  building relationships and continuously closing new deals. However, where
  there is a shortfall in Account Executive’s time or ability is in prospecting.
  Account Executives don’t like to do it, they usually aren’t good at it, and
  it’s a poor use of company resources to have the most high-priced asset doing
  lower-value work.

  ### Cold Calling 2.0


  > "To begin implementing the Cold Calling 2.0 system, you should have: At
  least one person 100% dedicated to prospecting...Yes, you can start part-time
  but it will be hard to get significant results until you have someone totally
  committed to it."- Predictable Revenue, page 36


  One of the refreshing comments that the authors make in this book is about
  cold calling. When Ross initially tried cold calling companies, he had little
  success. He would either be blocked by gatekeepers or the executives he did
  get on the phone did not like being sold to. It’s a common problem with
  prospecting.


  So instead of continuing to try something that didn’t work, Ross tried getting
  referrals to the right person in the company. **With a referral, the
  conversation feels a little bit more authentic and you have a legitimate
  reason to contact the prospect.** This is part of what Cold Calling 2.0 is
  about.


  First you build out a list of ideal targets that you want to approach. Then
  you craft an email that you can send to any individual contact you might have
  within that target company. Then you work the responses that come back
  (usually about a 9% response rate) and try to connect with the right person
  within the company. From there you try to schedule a “qualification
  conversation” to better understand their needs and whether your solution would
  be a fit. Once qualified, that qualified opportunity can be introduced to your
  quota-carrying account executive for a deeper conversation into how your
  solution can make a difference.


  **This process above is repeated and refined every time.** You might find that
  some industries are more open to your product than others or certain
  departments within a company (e.g. Human Resources, Sales, etc.) could be more
  interested. Ross provides tactical questions to ask to open up conversations
  at the start: basic voicemail scripts, and much more to get an outbound sales
  rep to get started. One tip that I really liked was starting the phone call
  with “Did I catch you at a bad time?” It’s a great way to ease the initial
  tension of a cold call but also see if you can schedule a better time to
  connect if the prospect is unavailable.

  ### Specialize your teams


  > "The point is to focus your highest value people on the low-volume but
  high-value activities (building relationships at key accounts), and specialize
  other roles and sales reps to take over low-value yet high-volume activities
  (prospecting into untargeted cold accounts.)"- Predictable Revenue, page 31


  **Specializing your sales team is the first step in improving the productivity
  of your sales team.** Sales people are typically responsible for three main
  things: prospecting, qualifying, and closing. These are three distinct
  responsibilities and require different mindsets and skill sets to be
  successful. The challenge with many sales teams is that their sales people are
  doing two or often three of the tasks on their own. They switch in and out of
  these responsibilities throughout the day, which slows their productivity and
  usually leads to underachievement.


  The premise of _Predictable Revenue_ is based on specialization. By creating a
  team dedicated to prospecting, another to qualifying, and another to closing,
  you can dramatically increase the impact of your sales team’s productivity and
  revenue generation. Not only that, you’re able to create a type of “farm
  system” where employees can develop their skill sets first by learning how to
  qualify warm inbound leads then to prospect into cold accounts and then move
  into “closing” their own deals over years of skill and professional
  development.


  Developing a team focused specifically on outbound prospecting helps lift the
  load from Account Managers/Executives who often don’t have the time to
  research into accounts or experience making cold calls effectively. With a
  high performing outbound sales team, you are able to ensure that new leads
  continue to flow into your sales funnel and word about your product or service
  is being spread through your team. Let’s take a look at insight #2 for a quick
  overview of how you can setup your own outbound team.
f_conclusion: >-
  **The old methods of cold prospecting have changed.** The focus now is to
  build out a team specifically focused on the prospecting (rather than having
  their attention divided on a multitude of tasks) and having them use a
  consistent process to improve with each call they make. Specialization in the
  prospecting process allows sales reps to improve their craft and build out a
  skill essential to their future success.
