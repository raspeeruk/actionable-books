  ### Irrational Relativity


  > "That’s a lesson we can all learn: the more we have, the more we want. And
  the only cure is to break the cycle of relativity."- Predictably Irrational,
  page 21


  In 1993, American securities regulators forced publicly trading companies to
  reveal pay and salary details for all of their top executives for the first
  time in history. Ostensibly, this was in a bid to build public awareness
  around the outrageous executive compensation schemes that were in place at the
  time.


  Newspapers regularly ran stories comparing CEO pay schemes implemented in
  different companies, and financial pundits spent hours on television and reams
  of print decrying the loss of America’s moral compass in the financial world.
  Which makes what happened next all the more curious.


  CEO compensation schemes **skyrocketed.** By 2008, CEOs were earning more than
  369 times the salary of the average worker, up from 131 times in 1993, and 76
  times in 1976.


  Why? Because now, all CEOs knew what other CEOs were earning and, since no-one
  likes to be left out, each demanded pay schemes that matched the salaries of
  their counterparts. Dollar for dollar, companies started keeping up with the
  Joneses, and executive compensation schemes steadily pushed themselves towards
  even more outrageous boundaries.


  But regular people behave irrationally too.


  Have you noticed how many people purchase a bigger, faster, shinier car, or a
  bigger, better and swankier house than before – even if they can’t afford to
  keep up with the payments?


  The allure of relativity is so strong that it clouds judgment. It’s no
  surprise that every religion and philosophy out there urges people to avoid
  coveting their neighbours’ possessions; it’s not because they fear for
  peoples’ neighbours, but rather it’s because they fear for what we could do to
  ourselves when we try to head for the greener grass of the neighbours’ lawn.

  ### The True Cost of Nothing


  > "Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is
  FREE! we forget the downside. FREE! gives us such an emotional charge that we
  perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.
  Why? I think it’s because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. The real
  allure of FREE! is tied to this fear…and so, given this choice, we go for what
  is FREE!."- Predictably Irrational, Page 54-55


  If you’ve ever bought a book through Amazon.com, you might notice that you’re
  eligible for FREE! shipping for orders that go over a certain amount.


  Buy one book for $16.97 and pay $3 in shipping costs. Buy two books that total
  more than $30 and get FREE! shipping. Sounds great right? FREE! shipping, why
  would you pass up on that? Turns out that a lot of Amazon’s book shoppers
  think alike, and for a long time Amazon enjoyed hefty global online book
  sales, except for in one place: France.


  Why France? Turns out that the French division of Amazon decided to charge the
  princely sum of one euro ($1.35 USD) on orders over 30 Euros, causing sales to
  dampen. Shipping wasn’t FREE! so French customers behaved “rationally” (ie.
  buying only the book they came for, rather than 3 or 4 more). When Amazon
  France adopted the FREE! shipping option, French customers responded
  irrationally and online national book sales skyrocketed to match Amazon’s
  international levels.


  FREE! doesn’t just make us behave erratically, it makes us behave downright
  irrationally – but predictably irrationally. The human brain gets so excited
  by the idea of getting something for nothing that we often end up making poor
  decisions that can easily be avoided. How long did you wait in line for that
  free scoop of Baskin Robbins ice cream? How long did you spend waiting in line
  to enter your local museum when they decided to allow free admission for a
  limited time window?


  So the next time you go to a mall intending to buy a pair of high quality
  sweat absorbing athletic socks with 30% discount, but end up leaving with some
  cheap plain cotton socks that won’t last you a month, simply because they
  happened to be stored in a bin marked FREE!, you’ll know what happened.


  If you can’t figure it out, go pick up this book. You just might end up
  cutting down on quite a few cups of coffee.

  ### Irrationality Comes with a Price


  > "Initial prices \[for products\] are largely “arbitrary” and can be
  influenced by responses to random questions; but once those prices are
  established in our minds, they shape not only what we are willing to pay for
  an item, but also how much we are willing to pay for related products (this
  makes them coherent)."- Predictably Irrational, pages 29-30


  How much would you pay for a necklace made of black pearls?


  It’s the 1970s: Soul Train is on the air, Nixon is in China and sideburns are
  all the rage. You’ve never seen a black pearl necklace before in your life but
  all of a sudden, there it is, a lovely necklace made of Tahitian black pearls,
  sitting delicately on the slender neck of a Fifth Avenue jewellery store
  mannequin.


  How much would you pay for that necklace? $100? $200? You’ve never seen it
  before and you certainly don’t know how much it’s worth.


  Here’s where it gets interesting. Suppose I had a price tag of $250 stuck to
  the necklace. Would the simple display of this number alongside the necklace
  influence your valuation of black pearls? What if someone had made a mistake
  and stuck a price tag of $2.50 instead, do you think this would cause you to
  value black pearls differently?


  It turns out that once we make a certain product the standard for all products
  in that category, it’s much easier for us to assign value to each product in
  that category. So if Starbucks comes to define our daily coffee experience
  (with its accompanying $7 price tags), Tim Hortons, Second Cup and Seattle’s
  Best are all judged according to that one standard Venti, affecting how we
  view and value each brand in turn. The key is to get that initial “standard of
  value” correct.


  Ask yourself this question: Is what I’m consuming really worth the time,
  effort and money that I spend in procuring it? Would I better off using that
  money to do something else – like purchasing and reading a book?

Why is it that we often don’t bat an eye at spending an extra $200 on an expensive suit, or $5000 on a house purchase, but can then turn around and spend hours clipping PennySaver coupons to save 25 cents on our next soup purchase?

Why are we comfortable spending $6 on a cup of coffee now, when only 5 years ago we would be loathe to spend more than $3 on a cup of coffee (corrected for inflation)?

Why do we keep stuffing ourselves at the all-you-can buffet even after our stomachs begin groaning after the third helping?

Full of startling insights delivered with author Dan Ariely’s characteristic wit, _Predictably Irrational_ is Ariely’s first attempt at chronicling the oddity of human thought and choice, particularly when it comes to their financial and consumptions habits.

The study of economics relies on a key set of assumptions around the notion of **rational consumer choice.** Simply stated, the idea that consumers are able to use reason and logic to make the decisions that are best for them, with the aim of maximizing their personal happiness and satisfaction. In doing so, the rationale goes, society benefits as a whole.

With oodles of experimental evidence, Ariely shows that not only is human behaviour surprisingly non-rational (irrational), it is _predictably_ irrational, consistent across a variety of situations, and can therefore be predicted and corrected for – if only we knew how.
