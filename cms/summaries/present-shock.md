  ### The Pains of Digital Dissonance


  > "The extraordinary measures we take to stay abreast of each minuscule change
  to the data stream end up magnifying the relative importance of these blips to
  the real scheme of things."- Present Shock, page 75


  As Rushkoff describes, we feel a continual pull to check our social media
  channels and emails because of the 7×24 nature of the digital world we live
  in. From the moment an update is posted or the email is sent, we are behind
  and the information is stale. Digital channels can update simultaneously,
  while we remain analog and only able to do one thing at a time (despite our
  best efforts to multi-task), with a rate of change that is impossible to
  match. Rushkoff notes, “these interruptions, more than simply depleting our
  cognitive abilities, create the sense that we need to keep up with their
  impossible pace lest we lose touch with the present.” We are continually out
  of sync, and it is driving us crazy.


  This dissonance plays through in the way digital data streams can manipulate
  reality as well. We forget that what we read online might not be accurate and
  or tell the whole story, yet leaves us feeling inadequate about our own lives.


  Our desire for the only most current information means we end up unfairly
  devaluing the present moments of our real lives. Rushkoff believes we
  “sacrifice our connection to the truer present in which we are living”, rather
  than disconnecting from the digital world to stay more firmly connected to
  what’s happening in our analog world.


  So, how can we reclaim our sanity? Reset your priorities, and take back
  control.

  ### Make Technology Work For You


  > "Technology gives us more choice over how and when we do things. What we
  often forget is that our bodies are not quite as programmable as our
  schedules."- Present Shock, page 92


  It is easy to allow technology to control your behaviour, rather than defining
  how and when you access the information. Dropping the push notifications,
  choosing certain times for accessing emails, or putting your phone away when
  you’re out with others are all controls you can easily put in place that allow
  you to determine when to digitally connect, and when to stay offline. Rushkoff
  reminds us that “digital can be stacked; the human gets to live in real time.”

  ### What Happens ‘In Real Life’ Matters Most


  > "We must retrain ourselves instead to see the reward in the amount of time
  we get to spend in the reverie of solo contemplation or live engagement with
  another human being. Whatever is vibrating on the iPhone just isn't as
  valuable as the eye contact you are making right now."- Present Shock, page
  117


  We have lost our ability live in the moment, and we’re less and less willing
  to stay out of the digital world for any length of time. We are easily
  distracted by the ping of our devices, returning instead to the often mindless
  distractions found online. We have forgotten how to simply be in the moment,
  and alone with our own thoughts. We need to create space in our lives to
  think, connect with others and let our minds wander. Otherwise, we risk
  missing opportunities for deep problem solving, better decisions, and
  connecting with people face-to-face.


  The relentless pace of new information also means there is no time to create
  an enhanced version of yourself or your company online, as details about how
  you treat your customers and employees will find its way to the Internet at a
  speed that you can’t possibly manage or control. Rushkoff ‘s advice is to
  “walk the talk”, and let your true actions be your brand’s online persona.
f_conclusion: >-
  Rushkoff’s book is complex, and provides an incredible amount of depth to this
  topic, which is impossible to fully explore here. While some of the terms
  Rushkoff has coined may be intimidating at first (including chapters called
  “digiphrenia”, “fractalnoia” and “apocolypto”), the book is an important read
  for anyone who is struggling with digital overload and wants to better
  understand the causes, impacts, and how to regain control.

Have you ever felt compelled to check your phone for social media, email or text updates, even if you had someone – whether a client, family member or close friend – sitting right in front of you? Or felt overwhelmed by the volume of tweets, emails and updates calling you urgently away from the tasks, or people, at hand? If you have, you aren’t alone. In _Present Shock_, author Douglas Rushkoff dives into the challenges that the digital age presents for us, and what we can do about it.

Rushkoff argues that the constant stream of digital information puts us on a hamster wheel of continual monitoring, and distorts our ability to value the elements of “real life” that are happening around us, which ultimately should matter more.

This book was a great reminder for me that the solution to a strong digital presence and optimal access of information isn’t to spend more time online; rather, to find ways to better optimize my use of it. For every negative impact Rushkoff mentions, the flip side highlights the many benefits the digital age has brought to our lives, so this is not a decree to return to a technology-free way of life. Rather, it is the acknowledgement that technology offers us a tremendous resource, and we need to find tools and solutions to leverage it, rather than being at its mercy.
