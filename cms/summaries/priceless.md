  ### Prices Are Imaginary Numbers


  > "Yard sales reveal a truth we might not care to admit in a business deal:
  prices are made-up numbers that don't always carry much conviction."-
  Priceless, page 9


  Just as we assume teachers have the answers at the back of the book, we assume
  that prices are part of **some rational business logic.**


  They are not.


  Our first reaction to that truth is denial. We spend money every single day
  and we want to believe that it makes sense.


  Awareness that we are predictably irrational makes it easier to believe.
  Poundstone shows that once we’re aware that pricing is psychology, not logic,
  we can nudge ourselves back in line to some extent.


  Humans are very good at **comparisons**. This is heavier than that. One is
  larger than the other. Louder. Softer. Brighter.


  We are lousy at putting size, loudness, weight on any kind of **absolute
  scale.** It’s why the carnival chap who guesses our weight is so impressive:
  most of us have no clue what a gallon of milk weighs, we just know that by the
  time we get to the third flight of stairs it’s the heaviest thing in the
  world.


  Fortunately, our ability to compare can help us significantly, if we **know
  what to compare.** Let’s take two examples: anchoring, and marketing in
  thirds.

  ### Marketing In Thirds


  > "\[T\]hey could make the students want one beer or the other, just by adding
  a third choice that few or no one wanted."- Priceless, page 152


  You’re going out to dinner tonight and can think of **two restaurants.** One
  is an hour away and a bit pricey, but has a reputation for excellent food and
  service. The other is 20 minutes away, moderately priced, with some pleasant
  reviews online.


  For most of us, neither choice is obvious. But let’s introduce **a third
  restaurant.** This one is a cheap place right down the block, and you know
  it’s only so-so in all respects.


  Now **which of the three** would you pick? Write it down.


  Okay, go back and read about the **first two restaurants** again. This time,
  the **third restaurant** we’re adding will require a short flight and an
  overnight stay, is very expensive, but is known for its epicurean delights and
  world-class pampering.


  Which of the three do you choose now?


  In similar situations, researchers have discovered they can jerk people around
  like a marionette by presenting **two feasible options, plus a third unlikely
  option.** Adding a junk option or a luxury option always had the same effect:
  whichever was **the new “middle” option became the run-away favorite.**


  Make the product or service you really want to sell the middle option. I’m not
  suggesting you offer a junk option, though a luxury option isn’t a bad idea if
  you can make it real (bear in mind, some folks will choose each of the
  options, not just the middle.)


  You can nudge people toward the option you prefer by making it the middle
  option.


  This raises a topic Poundstone touches only briefly: **the ethics of
  pricing.** When we know that people accept or reject prices based on
  psychology they don’t see or understand, it is entirely possible to mislead
  them and take advantage. (Not just possible; it happens all day long every
  single day.)


  It’s a slimy way to make a living. Use your knowledge of the irrational
  psychology of pricing to **protect yourself;** use it to nudge your clientele
  toward **better choices.** But don’t be slimy.


  Use your power for good, not evil. At least with an understanding of the
  psychology, you **have** power.

  ### Meaningless Unrelated Numbers Affect Our Beliefs About Prices

  demonstrate it statistically -- but it is real nonetheless."- Priceless, page

  A slightly different pair of questions: Is the average summer temperature in
  San Francisco higher or lower than 32 degrees? What is the average summer
  temperature in San Francisco?


  Folks presented with the first pair will consistently guesstimate **higher**
  than folks presented with the second pair. Even though both 500 degrees and 32
  degrees are **ridiculous** for San Francisco’s summer, they affect our
  guesstimates. **We anchor to the number offered, and adjust away from it.**
  The way we’re wired, though, we consistently fail to adjust **far enough.**


  When Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky proved this with extensive research,
  even the scientific community refused to believe it. Economists ignored it for
  decades.


  Whoever quotes a number first in a negotiation sets an anchor which, like it
  or not, **affects the other party’s perception** of what they’ll have to pay
  or accept.


  The antidote to anchoring is to **consider the opposite.** Make a list of
  reasons that party’s number could be inaccurate.


  This seems commonsense, but anchoring is an **unconscious** feature of how our
  brains work. Its effect can only be mitigated **consciously,** and even then,
  not entirely.


  When you can, be the first to say a number in a negotiation. Get the other
  party anchored to your number, and you’ll be less susceptible to anchoring’s
  effects.


  Is the average summer temperature in San Francisco higher or lower than 500
  degrees? What is the average summer temperature in San Francisco?

This is not a book about coming up with prices, it’s about **understanding** them. More accurately, it’s about our **fundamental misunderstanding** of what prices even mean.

Poundstone frequently references [Dan Ariely](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/predictably-irrational/), [Kahneman and Tversky](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/), Richard Thaler, and others who will be familiar to those of you who like to read about how our brains work – and how they often don’t.

A series of short (2-5 page) treatises which build and focus as you move through the book, he begins with our **cluelessness** about prices, gives us some **psychological** grounding, shows us good and bad **pricing in action,** and gives us greater awareness of our limitations and **how to shore them up.**
