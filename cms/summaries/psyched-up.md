  ### Enough Already, Let’s Get Psyched!


  > "'These tools apply to any type of high performance, whether you’re in an
  emergency room, a law firm, a courtroom, a boardroom… We’re biological
  creatures, and we have that fight-or-flight response, even in a corporate
  setting. These tools can absolutely help.’"- David Hesse, IMG’s director of
  athletic and personal development, quoted in Psyched Up, page 153


  You want the best performance for yourself and for your team. So you employ
  every strategy, tactic and trick. And when one of those high-stakes moments
  are on the horizon, you prepare—the best presentation, the best visuals, the
  best delivery. And you practice, practice, practice. Whether it’s the rote
  delivery or anticipating every question, you are all about the preparation.
  You run yourself or your team through their paces. And then, you go. But are
  you leveraging the moments before the big event? Rather than torture the team
  with endless rehearsal up to the last minute, consider using the latest
  research to flip their anxiety to excitement. Or take a break and create a new
  ritual, a battle cry, or a silly handshake, to ensure success.

  ### Pump it Up to Get Psyched!


  > "To really make the most of the final moments before you perform, reducing
  anxiety isn’t enough. You also want to build positive emotions, such as
  confidence, self-efficacy, and power."- Psyched Up, page 145-146


  As a leader you can help your teams achieve better results by introducing them
  to pre-performance routines. Research shows that getting together to perform
  seemingly-silly ritual actions such as hand claps, foot stomps and
  huddle-style “Let’s go!” before embarking on a task can improve a team’s
  performance. Before an all-important last day of a month, sales managers can
  rev up their sales people by leading this behavior.


  It’s also been shown that “pre-performance” rituals such as elaborately
  opening a wine bottle in that familiar series of motions increase the diners’
  involvement in the experience, which increases their enjoyment. Is there a
  ritual you can invent to accompany your customers’ experience? Think of
  Walmart greeters, or the actions a good salesperson takes when they prepare
  your dressing room with the clothes you’ve selected. These enhance the
  experience, build loyalty, and boost sales.


  Another easily actionable tip involves what psychologists call “priming.” Try
  one of these: have your team, colleagues or worker-bees journal about their
  past successes before attempting today’s challenge. Frame reminders of past
  work on the walls. Take and share a photo of the team flush from a past
  success before they climb the next (metaphoric) mountain. In experiment after
  experiment psychologists documented enhanced performance when workers were
  exposed to reminders of positive performance like these.


  Or if you are more of the speech type, consider using the five-part format of
  General Stanley McChrystal:


  1.  Tell your “troops” what they are being asked to do.

  2.  Remind them why it’s important.

  3.  Tell them why you know they can do it.

  4.  Have them pause and think about what they have accomplished together.

  5.  Exhort them to go and do it.


  Just don’t tell them to “calm down.” That’s not realistic and that emotion is
  too different from their agitation (see insight #1 above!). And while it seems
  helpful to describe what might go wrong and why the world will keep spinning
  if it does, now is not the time to introduce negative thoughts to their
  consciousness.

  ### Get Smart to Get Psyched


  > "In helping humans perform, psychology is the software, but biology is the
  hardware."- Psyched Up, page 19


  The first thing to do is leverage biology. The rush of fear and anxiety we
  feel before a big presentation or interview is caused by adrenaline being
  dumped into our system. Originally quite helpful when confronted by a charging
  rhino, in modern days we are stuck with the racing heart, sweaty palms, and
  frozen brain of the “fight or flight” response. How we speak to ourselves in
  the moment can make the difference. Using a computer-scored singing game, the
  group of singers who used pre-performance self-talk to say “I’m so excited”
  outscored the “I’m so anxious” group with a 50% higher score. So when you feel
  that adrenaline rush, appreciate it as an “exciting” boost, talk to yourself
  to remind you of your excitement, and ride the wave!


  Another helpful insight is to consider how much and what kind of thought to
  put in during a performance. As described in Daniel Kahneman’s [_Thinking,
  Fast and
  Slow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/),
  “System 2” thinking demands attention and your brain’s processing power.
  “System 1” operates on automatic. So McGinn advocates that you decide for each
  big moment whether you want your thinking brain turned “on” or “off.” In an
  interview or while in Q&A after a presentation, you’d want “System 2”—complete
  alertness to all factors. You would be alert to the response from the room,
  your choice of answers to a question, and monitoring where you are headed. But
  for speeches, McGinn recounts the strategy of Jonathan Jenkins, a sought-after
  speaker and start-up CEO who is known for his calm demeanor. While most of
  each speech will be customized and, because he’s extremely busy, just lightly
  rehearsed, Jenkins uses a standard biographical opening to connect with the
  audience and settle in. Having flown on automatic “System 1” thinking, by the
  time he arrives at his customized remarks Jenkins has established rapport with
  the audience. He can then use “System 2” thinking to concentrate as he
  delivers the more unique parts of the remarks.

  "If you work two thousand hours a year but your overall success rests mostly
  on your performance during a couple of dozen crucial hours—at pitch meetings,
  sales calls, a key conversation with your boss, and so on—the tools in this
  book should help you do better."

> "If you work two thousand hours a year but your overall success rests mostly on your performance during a couple of dozen crucial hours—at pitch meetings, sales calls, a key conversation with your boss, and so on—the tools in this book should help you do better." _\- Psyched Up, page 11_

Ever since Malcolm Gladwell unearthed the 10,000 hour practice = mastery rule we’ve become obsessed with logging practice hours. Author and Harvard Business Review senior editor Daniel McGinn’s curiosity is about the difference a few minutes, not thousands of hours, can make. _Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You Succeed_ explores how successful athletes, musicians, and business people methodically leverage the moments before the “big moment.” He examines research on what to say, what to do, and how to lead your team to the best outcome possible.

Since we are in an ever-more competitive world, figuring out how to perform just a little better is important—it could be the edge we need to win the pitch or the job. And as I read through his suggestions and thought about utilizing them at work, I realized that leaders who adopt these things would be more supportive, more positive, and yes—more fun. That’s an edge worth having, too.
