  ### All Good Things Take Time


  > "We all live on the parabola: We discover something new. We get carried away
  with it, frightening pundits, who declare that life will never be the same.
  Then we find our balance."- Public Parts, page 119


  We’re all at different places in our relationship with privacy, particularly
  given the elusive, subjective, and ever changing definition of the concept.


  But any visions of anti-Internet society rising up to insist on widespread
  protection, universal restriction and obligatory regulation don’t align with
  the reality. As with the introduction of any new technology, the glut of media
  coverage and with quotes from very vocal “privacy advocates” — still just
  mid-way through their parabolic journey through privacy — may be skewing our
  perception of public opinion.


  In fact, as Jarvis explains, just 33% of Internet users report being concerned
  about how much information about them is available online, a number that has
  dropped by 7% in four years. _Public Parts_ was published in 2011, so it’s
  possible that number has dropped another 7% or more since.


  As with other technologies that raised questions about privacy and access to
  information as their inception — the printing press, cameras and ATMs, to name
  a few — exposure and time have enabled many of us to find balance in our
  relationship with them, seeing the value that these products and services
  provide in exchange for our information. The “cookies” we were blocking just a
  few years ago, for example, are now considered vital, given the number of
  passwords we’d otherwise have to remember and re-enter daily.


  There’s reason to be protective of your privacy, to be sure. But informed
  analysis and understanding of how your information is shared and used will
  serve you better than complete avoidance of the web, in the long run.

  ### Rules of Engagement

  child and those you teach your children about how to treat others all still
  apply. The net is still just a place filled with people."- Public Parts, page

  It’s easy to think of the web as an entirely different world, with its own
  culture and its own set of rules. And in many ways, it is. But at the end of
  the day, regardless of the web site you’re on, the information you’re seeking
  or sharing, and the avatars you’re interacting with, the Internet really is a
  means of interacting with other people. If we all agree to treat one another,
  and our information, with the same respect we would offline, we can take
  advantage of the power of the web, rather than letting it paralyze us. Here
  are some good rules to keep in mind:


  *   **The Tattoo Rule**: The Internet doesn’t forget. The things that you
  share now will be around later. Share wisely.

  *   **The Cabernet Rule**: Just as an excess of alcohol could spoil a
  professional event, so too can it wreck your online reputation. Be careful
  mixing alcohol and Internet, and look out for friends who are about to.

  *   **The Front-Page Rule**: What goes online may stay online, but that
  presents great reward, not just great risk. “Think about the front-page when
  you share, not just out of fear but also with an eye toward opportunity.”

  *   **The Golden Rule**: Treat others the way you would want to be treated,
  just as you would offline. Share what you can. Give credit where credit is
  due. Boost up good work and the people who create it.

  ### The Ethic of Knowing


  > "Regulating the use rather than the gathering of information is a wise
  strategy. If we keep chasing around trying to stop information from being
  revealed or gathered, we’ll find ourselves in a perpetual game of
  whack-a-mole."- Public Parts, page 104


  As Jarvis puts it, “Privacy is the ethic of knowing.” For individuals,
  companies and government agencies, just the regular day-to-day fulfillment of
  our duty and purpose necessitates not only learning facts about people, but
  keeping records of things, and analyzing that data. We don’t mind that our
  doctor keeps track of our medical history, or that our bank sends us
  statements showing what purchases we’ve made, or that our web browser saves
  our passwords. It’s when that information is misused that we feel our privacy
  has been violated.


  Jarvis offers some helpful tips for the care and keeping of personal
  information to ensure that you don’t violate someone’s privacy when they
  entrust you with their personal information. Some of the most widely
  applicable:


  *   Be transparent about what you will do with information: If it’s given to
  you for one reason, don’t assume you have permission for other types of usage
  or sharing.

  *   Protect information: If someone trusts you to hold their information,
  ensure that you’re protecting it from prying eyes.

  *   Don’t use information against people (unless they deserve it).

  *   Add value: If you’re collecting data, use it for good, not evil.

  After Jarvis has explored the history of privacy that has led up to the
  web-dominated world we presently operate in, he acknowledges that we are at an
  important junction in the way we share information on the web: “There are only
  two possible choices: to resist it, which is futile, or to understand it and
  find the opportunities in it.”

> "The internet has changed the infrastructure of relationships… Each time you don’t share, a relationship loses its wings." _\- Public Parts, page 46_

It’s undeniable that the rise of the Internet has completely changed not only the way we operate and do business, but the way we operate as a society. It’s impacted how we find information, how we share information, how much information we share, how we communicate with one another, when we communicate with one another, who we communicate with, how we express ourselves and more.

And while all that sharing and communicating has certainly allowed us to open up our worlds, many privacy advocates are quick to point out that it’s also opened us up to risks, from benign online abuse by anonymous sources to complete identity theft that can expose our health and financial information.

With a thorough look at historical parallels in the world of privacy, detailed examples of practical applications of information sharing, and analysis of landmark shifts in cultural perceptions of what’s “private” vs. “public,” in _Public Parts: How Sharing in the Digital Age Improves the Way We Work and Live_ Jeff Jarvis offers both a primer on privacy as a societal construction and a framework for operating in a world where the web, and your presence on it, is nearly unavoidable.
