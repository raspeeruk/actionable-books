  ### Am I making a difference?


  > "If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide
  the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and
  endless sea."- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (writer), Quick and Nimble, page 19


  You likely already have a mission and that mission may be what attracted your
  employees to your company. Today more than ever before, people are inspired to
  work for companies that have missions that are meaningful to them. But that is
  not enough. What is more important, says David Sacks, the founder, chairman
  and CEO of Yammer, is a simple plan that helps each person see the clear link
  between what they are doing and how it drives the goals to achieve the
  mission. “When you create a shared goal, you turn an out-group to an
  in-group,” said David Rock, Director of NeuroLeadership Institute.


  So ask yourself, “Have I created up to three clear goals and helped every
  person on my team see the clear link between what they do and how it
  contributes to the mission?” People want to contribute, know they have made a
  difference, feel like they have a level of control over their destiny and that
  they are valued. This will change the culture from lackadaisical to motivated
  and your people from time punchers to contributors who want to get the job
  done right!

  ### Command-and-control leadership is dead


  > "One leadership lesson I learned – and this goes in the bucket of ‘obvious’
  – is the critical importance of being a good person and treating people
  well."- Richard R. Buery Jr. (CEO of the Children’s Aid Society), Quick and
  Nimble, page 51


  People can’t be successful when there is fear. Command and control no longer
  works. When people don’t like going to work because of the way they are
  treated, outcomes will suffer. Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of DreamWorks
  Animation believes that the quality of followers is in direct correlation to
  the respect the leader holds them in. He says it is not how much the followers
  respect the leader that is important but rather how much the leader respects
  the followers. It’s everything, he says.


  I learned a new meaning to MRI in this chapter. Robin Domeniconi, the former
  chief brand officer for the Elle Group, says she uses the expression “MRI” as
  a cultural cornerstone. It means “most respectful interpretation” of what
  someone is saying to you. This allows you to say anything to anyone as long as
  you say it the right way. For example, “I’m just curious, and I want to
  understand what you’re saying better. Right now, my point of view is quite
  different. So can you help me understand why you don’t want to do this?” is
  going to be much better accepted than the “That’s the craziest idea I’ve ever
  heard.” I have applied this with my business partner and our arguments
  discussions have become much more productive and pleasant.


  Beyond respect, leaders need to take interest in their people and care about
  them. David C. Novak, the CEO of Yum Brands, said that caring about people is
  the cornerstone of his leadership approach (read the summary of his book
  [here)](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/taking-people-with-you/). I
  had a boss once who infrequently asked about my family and it seemed she did
  it more out of a sense of duty than sincerity. I had very little confidence
  that she cared about me. As a result I protected myself and felt less engaged.
  The ideas shared by Bryant reinforce my decision to allow myself the pleasure
  of taking a personal interest in the people I work with. It’s more fun for all
  of us.

  ### School should never end


  > "Every company has to adopt a philosophy of constant learning if it hopes to
  succeed in today’s economy."- William D. Green (former chairman and CEO of
  Accenture), Quick and Nimble, page 148


  Think about the last high-performing people who left your organization.
  Chances are, they left because they had not been learning; they were bored. It
  is a well-known fact that high performing people are constant learners, so
  smart leaders will nurture that trait and foster a culture of motivated
  learners. How do they do that? Here are just a few of the actionable ideas:


  *   push people into different positions

  *   pay for training – but motivate people to opt-in

  *   encourage people to figure out themselves what they need for their
  development

  *   when your people come with a problem, don’t make decisions for them, ask
  them what they recommend

  *   encourage mistakes


  Huh? Encourage mistakes? Let’s delve into that last point a bit further. Mark
  Fuller of WET Design sometimes starts meetings by saying “Let me tell you
  where I just screwed up.” Why? He wants to set the tone of being comfortable
  exposing and learning from mistakes – together. He had a teacher who once
  advised him to applaud himself whenever he made an error. “Reward yourself
  because you caught the error before I did!” she said and forever changed his
  view of mistakes. After all, the expression isn’t ‘learn by trial and
  success’; it’s ‘learn by trial and error’.
f_conclusion: >-
  In summary, innovation is the by-product of an effective culture. And an
  effective culture is a result of treating people right. If you hire people to
  think (and who doesn’t these days?) you can not control how they think, but
  you can control or at least have an effect on the environment around them and
  create a culture conducive to great thinking, innovation and growth.

> "The companies that will thrive over the long haul, will understand that culture is a key element of their strategy." _\- Quick and Nimble, page 247_

Adam Bryant started with a simple idea. Instead of asking CEOs about their strategies and competitive landscapes, he asked them about:

*   leadership lessons they had learned,
*   the culture they try to foster,
*   how they hire.

This idea burgeoned into a feature column in the _New York Times_ called _Corner Office_ and a _New York Times_ bestseller by the same name. In his latest book, _Quick and Nimble,_ he draws on interviews with over two hundred CEOs to empower business leaders with wisdom and guidance to help their own companies thrive.

What is the secret ingredient that builds companies that thrive? What helps attract and retain the best talent, encourage employees to bring their best selves to work, and foster an environment in which everyone feels motivated to innovate? The interviews all point to a short answer – culture.

Don’t you love short answers? But it led me to then ask, what is culture and how do I create it and what kind should it be? Pause for a moment and ask yourself, **how much thought have you put into what you want your company culture to be and how much energy have you put into creating that culture?**

How long would it take you to ask two hundred CEOs to reveal their insights on how to build and foster a culture that encourages innovation and drives results? Adam Bryant has done all the legwork for you so you can just enjoy his collation of their advice. And this summary culls all that advice into just three actionable ideas.
