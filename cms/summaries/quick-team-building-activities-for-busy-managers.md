  ### Rome Wasn’t Built in a Day


  > "Remember, an effective team is built primarily on trust. Trust, and thus
  team-building, can rarely be accomplished in one giant leap."- Quick
  Team-Building Activities, page 7-8


  The well-known adage “_Rome wasn’t built in a day”_ reminds us that most
  things, particularly big important things, take time to create. When we set
  goals or decide to build something, we shouldn’t expect to achieve immediate
  success. Gardens don’t bloom the day we plant seeds. We don’t learn a new
  language after listening to one language tape. And vintage wine isn’t ready to
  drink the same day the grapes are crushed.


  The same goes for team-building. You can’t put a group of people in a room,
  run a few activities and expect a supportive, high-achieving, resilient team
  to instantly emerge. Team-building is as much a process as it is an outcome.
  And like any goal worth pursuing, it is important to set aside some dedicated
  time each week to make it happen.


  Fortunately Cole Miller makes this a relatively painless commitment with this
  compendium of 50 15 minute team-building exercises. That’s one team-building
  exercise a week for one year. If you are committed to building a strong team,
  set aside 15 minutes each week to lead your team in an activity that will
  challenge their assumptions, build camaraderie, establish group norms and
  values, and promote discussions on a wide range of topics! (Hint: you can
  start each team meeting with an activity or create a weekly “team time” huddle
  to rally folks together for 15 minutes of fun, yet focused learning).

  ### Connect the Dots


  > "The debrief is the most critical part of the team-building activity. It is
  the time when effective questions will guide the participants to link what
  they experienced in the activity with their behaviour on the job."- Quick
  Team-Building Activities, page 13


  Continuing on with the bird and flower example, my well-intentioned leader
  might have led a conversation about the similarities and differences in values
  and behaviours we heard across the management team. We might have explored how
  the same value can be demonstrated in different ways and situations and how to
  respect the ideas of others who might hold different values. Finally, we could
  have been asked to keep all of these values in mind as we entered into our
  budget discussion and decision-making.


  When a debrief is done well, the participants are able to bridge the gap
  between a fun activity and the lessons to be learned. And, the lessons learned
  will linger long after the activity is over, particularly if you refer back to
  it during 1:1 coaching sessions and anytime you see the behaviour in action
  and acknowledge it publicly. Not bad for a nominal investment of time and
  energy!

  ### Set the Stage


  > "The best team-building activity can become the worst team-building
  experience when there is no clear objective."- Quick Team-Building Activities,
  page 7


  The only thing worse than not doing any team-building exercises is to run an
  activity with no clear purpose for doing so. I once attended a meeting where
  my colleagues and I were asked to share what type of bird or flower we would
  be if we were a bird or flower. After everyone had answered the chair thanked
  us for sharing and then promptly dove into a budget update. Um…so why did we
  just spend 20+ minutes talking about birds and flowers?


  Well-executed team-building activities lead to specific outcomes and results.
  They are relevant and applicable to team performance and help create a safe
  environment to explore topical issues, address situational dynamics or learn
  more about how people think and process information. A short introduction can
  make all the difference because people engage better when they know **_why_**
  they are doing something.


  The bird and flower exercise (which is NOT one of the exercises in Cole
  Miller’s book) could have been introduced as a way to discover core values.
  For example, “Today’s team-building activity is about values and how they show
  up in our workplace. Please choose a bird or flower. Then tell us the
  characteristic you value most and how you demonstrate that characteristic as a
  manager.” Now the participants know how to reconcile the outputs of the
  activity with their work context. But don’t stop there. After the activity,
  continue to deepen participants’ insights and learning by connecting the
  exercise with your agenda topics.
f_conclusion: >-
  If you are looking for an inexpensive way to forge stronger relationships
  between the people you lead and work with, this book should meet your needs
  and budget nicely. As any wise investor knows, small incremental deposits over
  time will yield astounding returns. Grow your people and your team, 15 minutes
  at a time. You will be amazed at the ROI you generate.

Team-building. If I have one pet peeve as a facilitator and corporate trainer, it’s that the majority of people I encounter view team-building as an annual event rather than a daily practice or process. And while there is merit to taking some dedicated time away from business activities to focus exclusively on strengthening the working relationships between staff members, the benefits will be short-lived if the lessons learned are not linked back to what happens in the office or on the shop floor and reinforced regularly.

In _Quick Team-Building Activities for Busy Managers_, Brian Cole Miller has taken on the challenge of simplifying team-building efforts by compiling 50 practical activities that busy managers can incorporate into their staff meetings. Each exercise takes only 15 minutes to run and doesn’t require any previous training or expensive materials. Cole Miller has organized these activities into six categories relevant to any business – communication (listening and influencing); cooperation (working together), coping (dealing with change), creativity (solving problems), teamwork (appreciation and support) and connecting (getting to know one another). He also gives readers easy to understand, start to finish instructions on how to run an effective team-building activity, gives you a heads up about what could go wrong and how to prevent it from happening, and provides tips on how to deal with the situation positively if it does happen.
