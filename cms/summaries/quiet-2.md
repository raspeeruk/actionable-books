  ### The Extrovert Ideal


  > "But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to
  focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were
  bold and entertaining."- Quiet, page 21


  Our western culture has not always been built on the Extrovert Ideal, but it
  first peeked its head in the early 1900s and furthermore into the Industrial
  Age when our outward selves, and the impression we had on others, became front
  and centre. This spotlight became obvious because during this time people were
  shifting from working amongst family and neighbors to seeking employment and
  business arrangements with people whom they had no ties with—likability and
  sociability became what we based success on. Since, our culture has placed an
  undeniable importance on how we interact with others, and in what social
  situations we thrive.


  With the myth of charismatic leadership, Cain debunks the idea that all
  leaders need to be bold and boisterous. When assessing public perception, she
  uncovers that we may assess talkers as smarter, and those who talk fast versus
  slow as more capable, however, research, grade-point averages, and SAT scores
  say otherwise. There are many examples of quiet leaders, and introverts can
  have a big and significant impact. In fact, Professor Mills, a thought leader
  quoted in the book, reminds readers that “most leading in a corporation is
  done in small meetings and it’s done at a distance, through written and video
  communications.” A leader is not necessarily someone who finds fuel in large
  social settings, but rather someone who is intuitive to the company, the
  mission and the power of quiet, productive space. “\[W\]e don’t need giant
  personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own
  egos but institutions they run.”


  Cain also explores the dangers of GroupThink and the consistent push for
  collaboration, both as adults and as children within the school system.
  Because our introverted co-workers, teammates and peers recharge their
  batteries through quiet solitude, it is important to note the high energy,
  demanding group activities are draining, not invigorating, for this group.
  Work environments that rely on the Extroverted Ideal and the principles of
  GroupThink may not be getting the best out of their employees, rather it is “a
  new phenomenon that has the potential to stifle productivity at work and to
  deprive schoolchildren of the skills they’ll need to achieve excellence in an
  increasingly competitive world.”

  ### Free Trait Theory and Core Personal Projects


  > "Introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for the sake of work they
  consider important, people they love or anything they value highly."- Quiet,
  page 209


  The Free Trait Theory is based on the understanding that “we are born and
  culturally endowed with certain personality traits, but we can and do act out
  of character in the service of ‘core personal projects’.” What this means is
  that introverts are capable of extending outside of our comfort zone, perform
  and even excel in this realm if we are doing so for the betterment of our core
  values, rooted deep in our passion pool. She shares a very powerful example of
  an exuberant professor with incredible rapport, who goes home to his quiet
  nest and lives a private life of solitude. He excels for two unique reasons:
  he is passionate about his work and he has crafted his private life in such a
  way that he can recharge his battery effectively each day. These type of folks
  are self-monitors, highly skilled at modifying their behavior to the social
  demands of the situation. Cain has discovered three key steps to finding and
  committing yourself to your core personal projects that may prove useful for
  those looking to reach outside of their comfort zone:


  1.  **Think back to what you loved doing as a child.** Reverting back to the
  time when outer expectations impacted your experience less, when you were free
  to explore and enjoy in the most authentic way.

  2.  **Pay attention to the work you gravitate to.** What pulls you in out of
  sheer interest and not out of obligation? What task or environment leaves you
  more energized and revved up than before you opted to partake?

  3.  **Pay attention to what you envy**. While jealousy can be rooted in
  negativity, it often shows us what we desire most for ourselves and may speak
  volumes about what is lacking.


  Investing your energy wisely and consciously can be your biggest leg up when
  it comes to harnessing the power of Free Trait Theory.

  ### High & Low Reactivity


  > "To ask whether it’s nature or nurture… it’s like asking whether a blizzard
  is caused by temperature or humidity. It’s the intricate interaction between
  the two that makes us who we are."- Jeremoe Kagan, quoted in Quiet, page 109


  As introverts, we come by it honestly—our temperament is an intricate mix of
  nature and nurture, a dynamic blend of temperament and environment. The work
  of Jerome Kagan, a developmental psychologist, is highlighted by Cain
  throughout a significant portion of the book—specifically the classification
  of high and low reactivity on people as indicated through studies of infants
  through adolescence. In his studies, infants at four months old were subjected
  to various stimuli and new experiences and assessed for their physical
  reactions. Those that cried or flailed about were deemed _high reactive_
  (20%), those who remained placid were deemed _low reactive_ (40%), and then
  roughly 40% were somewhere along that spectrum of reactivity. As Kagan
  predicted, those who were high reactive were quiet teens, super sensitive to
  their social environment and leaned towards solitude, and likewise those that
  were low reactive thrived in social, front line situations later in life.


  Understanding where you land on the reactivity spectrum as an adult can help
  you determine where you sweet spot is, which is defined as, “your place where
  you are optimally stimulated… You can set up your work, your hobbies, and your
  social life so that you spend as much time inside your sweet spot as
  possible.” Just as we play to our strengths when it comes to hard skills, Cain
  makes a great case for readers to set ourselves up for success by playing to
  our reactivity level and aim to thrive within our own temperament.
f_conclusion: >-
  Knowing ourselves better and seeking to better understand those around us
  helps facilitate deeper relationships, fruitful partnerships and powerful,
  passion driven legacies. As an introvert, Cain empowers us to harness the
  unique attributes to our personal and professional advantage, all the while
  leveraging our Core Personal Projects to demand more of ourselves. As an
  extrovert, Cain encourages you to put your preconceptions and limitations to
  bed, and seek to better understand and appreciate the unique vantage point
  introverts may have, which may drive progress and creativity in various realms
  of your life. Cain’s research is persuasive, her approach is admirable and her
  message is powerful: “figure out what you are meant to contribute to this
  world and make sure you contribute it.”

> "Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again." _\- Anais Nin, quoted in Quiet, page 264_

Wherever you land on the personality spectrum, Susan Cain’s _Quiet_ is a superbly researched collection of data and observations related to the two ends, introversion and extroversion, and aims to provide empathy building tools for the seemingly less desirable classification, introversion. From the roots of the Culture of Personality to the practical exploration of the Free Trait Theory, Cain cracks the temperament discussion wide open and equips readers with a firm understanding of how to thrive as an introvert or embrace and collaborate effectively with the introvert in your life.
