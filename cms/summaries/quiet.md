  ### All Things Being Equal


  > "If we assume that quiet and loud people have roughly the same number of
  good (and bad) ideas, then we should worry if the louder and more forceful
  people always carry the day. ... yet studies in group dynamics suggest that
  this is exactly what happens."- Quiet, page 51


  One of my favorite stories from _Quiet (_a book, by the way, loaded with
  studies and anecdotes) is Cain’s experience sitting in on a first year Harvard
  Business School class. The exercise she was auditing was called the _Subarctic
  Survival Situation_, a role-play situation in which the class members are put
  into groups and, as a team, challenged with ranking the importance of 15 items
  that they “salvaged from their crash-landed plane”. The goal is to work
  synergistically – assumedly pooling the collective knowledge of the group – to
  rank the importance of their supplies as closely to a professional’s as
  possible.


  In this particular class, one of the students had “extensive experience in the
  Northern backwoods.” But he was also a quiet person. An introvert. The group
  didn’t listen to his suggestions (instead following the guidance of the
  loudest members of the group), to disastrous results.

  ### Time Outs


  > "'Restorative niche' is Professor Little's term for the place you go when
  you want to return to your true self."- Quiet, page 219


  Introverts recharge by spending time on their own. Extroverts recharge by
  connecting with other people. Regardless of which camp you fall into, very few
  of us (if any) are fortunate enough to automatically fill our days with the
  mix of solitude and connectedness that leaves us perfectly balanced. It’s
  important, as Cain explains in _Quiet_, to find those times to “balance” by
  engaging in those activities that match our temperament.


  If you’re an introvert who spends your work day with people, do your best to
  find some quiet time at lunch, or on short walks between activities. If you’re
  an extrovert working on something that requires long periods of isolation, try
  to build some interaction into your day – again, it could be as little as a
  lunch with a co-worker or friend.


  More important still, work at being aware of what recharges those who are
  important in your life – be it a spouse, child, co-worker or subordinate. Do
  your best to support their need for “balance” and – in the case of introverts
  – don’t take it personally when they need time alone every once in a while.

  ### Rethink Group Think


  > "We're so impressed by the power of online collaboration that we've come to
  overvalue all group work at the expense of solo thought. We fail to realize
  that participating in an online working group is a form of solitude all its
  own."- Quiet, page 89


  In addition to the volume and conviction with which they may share their
  ideas, one of the fundamental differences between introverts and extroverts is
  they way in which they go about solving problems. Where extroverts are quite
  happy to sit around a boardroom table, engaging in dialogue and building off
  each other’s ideas, introverts need space (and time) to reflect on a question
  or issue before sharing their fully formed, well thought out ideas with the
  rest of the team. All the benefits that the “thinking out loud” extroverts
  gain from group exercises, introverts experience through isolated reflection
  or one-to-one conversation. When you consider that up to half of your team
  mates are actually introverts (and this may include you!) this means that
  traditional “brainstorming” exercises, as we know them, can miss out on
  tapping some of the top ideas from smart individuals.


  When your situation calls for the best ideas – not just the loudest or most
  impassioned – try allowing room for people to generate their own ideas,
  **_before_** attempting to “collaborate” as a group. Having team members
  submit their ideas in writing, before discussion, can be an excellent (and
  easy) way to open the floodgates to diverse input.
f_conclusion: >-
  While _Quiet_ is most definitely a book of value for introverts, it’s also a
  great reminder for the rest of us that we’re all **human**. We all have
  wonderful features that make us unique, and that those characteristics truly
  shine when we’re given the opportunity to be our natural selves.

  "Probably the most common - and damaging - misunderstanding about personality
  type is that introverts are antisocial and that extroverts are pro-social. ...
  neither formulation is correct; introverts and extroverts are differently
  social."

There are people on your team who think deeply. They will wrestle with a problem longer than most and they excel in strategizing and solving complex problems. They engage in activities that align with their convictions and typically present opinion or insights from a well researched, well thought out place. Would you like to know who these people are in your organization?

They’re the ones not speaking up at your team meetings. They’re the ones who were against your “open concept” office layout (though you may not have heard them say so). They are your introverts.

When I say the word “introvert”, what comes to mind?

After having now read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Susan Cain’s _Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking_, my appreciation of the term has been radically altered. No longer does the word conjure images of social awkwardness and shyness, but rather the quiet fortitude that comes from someone in touch with a deeper level of thought and reflection – people who take stock of what they say before they say it and engage in activities and conversations that align with their convictions.

Despite the fact that Introverts make up 30% – 50% of the population, we’re living in a decidedly Extrovert-celebrating time and, as a result, some of your top people are being radically underutilized in your business team.

“If you’re a manager, remember that one third to one half of your workforce is probably introverted, whether they appear that way or not. … Make the most of introverts’ strengths – these are people who can help you think deeply, strategize, solve complex problems, and spot canaries in your coal mine.”
