  ### Take Chances, Regardless of the Outcome


  > "I know sometimes it's scary to think that you might do the wrong thing.
  It's terrifying to imagine wasting your ‘one shot’. But let me assure you,
  nothing you do will be wasted. Every decision you make, every path you take,
  has the ability to contribute something you need to succeed at your dream."-
  Quitter, page 8


  Without the use of smoke and mirrors or gimmicky ideas, Jon Acuff uses a
  combination of brutal honesty and wit to tell his story. **A story of how he
  went from working a job he could barely tolerate to finding and starting his
  dream job.** He bares his soul by admitting it was not the “last job” that
  made him realize how unhappy he was – it was a series of eight miserable jobs
  in eight years. He says that **following a dream is not a project to plan
  overnight and execute in the morning.** He encourages the entrepreneurial
  spirit that lives in each of us while steadily reinforcing the fact that that
  you cannot truly quit your day job without a precise outline and the inclusion
  of a decisive plan to fall back on.

  ### Create Our Own Definition of Success


  > "Pitting your dream against someone else's is a fantastic way to get
  discouraged and depressed."- Quitter, page 163


  Acuff reinforces that no two individuals have the same hopes, dreams, drive
  and potential. If human beings were all created similarly by design, there
  would be little incongruity or variation in our passions. If we shared the
  same desires, what would drive or motivate ingenuity? Acuff reaffirms that
  each of us has a dream. Dreams are not just something you can pick up and put
  down from time to time. **Dreams need to be nurtured and properly built to
  become realities.** It is an extremely simple and elementary concept that
  often gets lost on the unhappy masses who forget that the purpose of living is
  to experience things, to explore and to find what makes each of us happy.

  ### There is a Reason We Never Forget Our First Love(s)


  > "More often than not, finding out what you love doing most is about
  recovering an old love or an inescapable truth that has been silenced for
  years, even decades. When you come to your dream job, your thing, it is rarely
  a first encounter. It's usually a reunion."- Quitter, page 28


  Acuff makes regular references to “reunions” throughout the pages of
  _Quitter_. He suggests a brilliant yet simple idea to determine what your true
  passion is. He suggests taking a mental inventory designed to investigate what
  it is you used to love to do as a child or earlier in your life. He
  acknowledges that there are often times in our lives when we need a break from
  things, and he encourages us not to leave them completely. Instead, allow
  enough time to look at your life with a fresh perspective. Often we stumble
  upon ideas or occupations that deeply impassion us, yet for one reason or
  another, we have not matured enough financially or emotionally to commit
  ourselves fully. These are the very same things we often find ourselves
  reuniting with later in life, once we have better positioned ourselves to
  follow our dreams, to start loving what we do and to “quit” doing the things
  which drive our unhappiness.

  I often give books as gifts. Typically, as I read a book, I know before I am
  finished who would appreciate or benefit most from receiving it. As I read
  through _Quitter_ and then listened to the audiobook weeks later, I wondered
  many times over, who would be the most appropriate recipient? The answer, was
  obvious.

> "I don't want you to wake up at sixty-five and realize, 'I spend forty of my best years doing something that just funded my life.'" _\- Quitter, page 240_

Perhaps the worst fear of adulthood today, is what Jon Acuff finds the heart, soul and strength to define, address and solve in _Quitter_. He writes in a persuasive and genuine manner about a common fear which many of us feel, yet have difficulty identifying, discussing or putting into writing.

As I read through _Quitter_ and then listened to the audiobook weeks later, I wondered many times over, who would be the most appropriate recipient? The answer, was obvious.

**EVERYONE.** Without further reservation, I bought a dozen copies. They are already wrapped and ready for Christmas (in August.) The most valuable lesson I learned from Acuff is that inspiration and encouragement are the most satisfying gifts you can give another person. I am ecstatic knowing that through the work of Acuff, I will be giving both.
