  ### Ditch Traditional Meetings


  > "I wonder when we’ll realize what a trap we’ve set for ourselves. Regularly
  interrupting the day to bring our best minds together to focus on the urgent
  makes it impossible for these people to spend their focused energy on what’s
  actually important."- Read This Before Our Next Meeting, page 11


  “Traditional meetings”, as Al writes, tend to “create a culture of compromise”
  and “kill our sense of urgency” because more often than not, we have a habit
  of calling meetings that fall in one of three categories:


  **Convenience Meetings:** “Meetings called because it’s difficult to capture
  everything we want to say effectively in writing, quickly. These meetings
  rarely add any more value than a memo would have.”


  **Formality Meetings:** “Meetings called by managers who think it’s their job
  to hold them. It doesn’t matter whether these meetings are designed to give
  off the appearance of control and productivity, or whether they’re a way for
  managers to subtly exert their status; in either case, these meetings are
  wasteful.”


  **Social Meetings:** “Meetings for the purpose of connection. We sometimes
  call social meetings without realizing it… Unfortunately, social meetings
  quickly turn circular and expand to fit the time. You might want to slow down
  and chat, but perhaps not everyone in the room has the same goals (or time)
  that you do.”


  These types of meetings, quite frankly, can be big time wasters.  

  And we can’t afford to waste any more time (because time, of course, waits for
  no one).


  **So how can we be more effective with our meetings?  

  **By following the Seven Principles of Modern Meetings…

  ### Make A Decision


  > "In the Modern Meeting, the decision is King. All hail the King."- Read This
  Before Our Next Meeting, page 33


  Central to the Modern Meeting is a focus, and bias, towards decisive action.
  But before the Modern Meeting can take place, there are two important
  decisions you need to make:


  **1) Do I need to schedule a meeting?  

  **We often hold meetings to make decisions because we’re afraid of making, and
  owning, the decision ourselves. This isn’t acceptable with the Modern Meeting.


  Before you schedule a meeting, make a decision on the topic at hand. If you
  need input from others, speak to them on a one-on-one basis. Once you’ve made
  a decision, call a meeting to support that decision through conflict (to allow
  for a debate in conflicting opinions if you’re open to altering your decision)
  and/or coordination (coordinate with the necessary people to carry out the
  decision).


  **2) Do I need to attend this meeting?  

  **Each time you’re invited to a meeting, ask yourself these four questions:


  a) Will you be able to function if you read about the meeting after it’s
  over?  

  b) If you are given the decision we’re discussing in advance, can you give me
  your opinion in advance?  

  c) Do you add any value by sitting in the meeting without participating?  

  d) Are you attending symbolically or simply as a way to demonstrate your
  power?


  “If you have no strong opinion, have no interest in the outcome, and are not
  instrumental for any coordination that needs to take place, we don’t need
  you,” writes Pittampalli. “From now on, if you’re invited to a meeting where
  you don’t belong, please don’t attend.”

  ### Follow The Seven Principles of Modern Meetings


  > "Meetings need to be less like the endless commercial breaks during a
  football game, and more like pit stops at the Daytona 500."- Read This Before
  Our Next Meeting, page 14


  **1) The Modern Meeting supports a decision that has already been made.  

  **_“The Modern Meeting focuses on the only two activities worth convening for:
  conflict and coordination”._


  **2) The Modern Meeting moves fast and ends on schedule.  

  **_“Strong deadlines force parties to resolve the hard decisions necessary for
  progress… With too much time, even the most unshakable decision will be
  reconsidered.”_


  **3) The Modern Meeting limits the number of attendees.  

  **_“In the Modern Meeting, we invite only the people who are absolutely
  necessary for resolving the decision that has been prepared.”_


  **4) The Modern Meeting rejects the unprepared.  

  **_“Preparing an agenda involves thinking through what’s going to happen at
  the meeting – what the objectives are, who should be invited, what they should
  bring, and how long the meeting will last. Second, agendas establish the
  decision that is being discussed and elicits feedback and suggestions.”_


  **5) The Modern Meeting produces committed action plans.  

  **_“In the Modern Meeting, minutes are not required. We don’t need to know the
  details of what happened at the meeting, because it’s the same thing that
  happens at every Modern Meeting: conflict and coordination. All we need to
  know is the decision and the resulting action plan.”_


  **6) The Modern Meeting refuses to be informational. Reading memos is
  mandatory.  

  **_“All too often, I send out an important e-mail message, only to have them
  be read by just a few people. The Modern Meeting cannot survive in an
  organization that fails to read. We must keep meetings about decisions. They
  must stay sacred. The only way to do so is to cancel informational meetings.”_


  **7) The Modern Meeting works only alongside a culture of brainstorming.  

  **_“The brainstorm is so crucial to the success of the Modern Meeting… We also
  need sessions dedicated to the creation of possibilities. A place where the
  imagination is allowed to roam free and generate a plethora of ideas, from
  which innovation can be born.”_
f_conclusion: >-
  Anybody working on a project that they care deeply about, and as Seth Godin
  says, want to ship, should follow The Modern Meeting Standard. Unnecessary and
  poorly organized, and run, meetings are a big roadblock to getting any real
  work done – and it’s time we put a stop to it.

  "Over time, we’ve become nonchalant about bad meetings. If an operating room
  were as sloppily run as our meetings, patients would die. If a restaurant
  kitchen put as little planning into a meal as we put into our meetings, dinner
  would never be served."

You know you’ve been there. We all have.

Sitting in yet another time stealing meeting you’re “required” to attend.  
And of course, the meeting starts later than scheduled. And ends later than scheduled.  
And while you may be physically present, your mind isn’t.

As you sit there, “stuck” with perhaps the most unproductive sixty minutes you’ll spend all day, you’re trying to figure out how you’re going to make up for this lost time.

But that isn’t to say that meetings aren’t important.

“In our organization, though, and in modern organizations everywhere, meetings are the lever that allow coherent motion,” writes Al Pittampalli in _Read This Before Our Next Meeting_. “Meetings are the way we make change, and change is how we grow.”

The problem is in the way we approach and run our meetings. And the solution, as Al explains, is ditching Traditional Meetings and follow The Modern Meeting Standard.

“We must demand a culture where bad meetings aren’t tolerated,” believes Pittampalli. “If you hold a meeting that wastes the time of your colleagues, you’re blacklisted. We need a culture where people don’t dare show up to a meeting late or, even worse, unprepared, for fear of being shunned. We deserve a culture where the strong spirit of teamwork brings out the best of the group, not the worst of the individual.”
