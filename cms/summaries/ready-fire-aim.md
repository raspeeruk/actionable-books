  ### The Four Stages of Growth


  > "If you look at how businesses develop over time, either from your own
  experience or by looking at industry statistics for entrepreneurial ventures,
  you will see that there are basically four stages of growth."- Ready, Fire,
  Aim, page 15


  Through his own experience as a business owner, and as a business consultant,
  Michael found that every entrepreneurial business goes through four stages of
  growth:


  **Stage One:** Infancy – zero to $1 million in revenue  

  **Stage Two:** Childhood – $1 million to $10 million in revenue  

  **Stage Three:** Adolescence – $10 million to $50 million in revenue  

  **Stage Four:** Adulthood – $50 million to $100 million in revenue


  What he also noticed is that “each stage has its own unique characteristics in
  the form of problems, challenges, and opportunities” and it’s important to pay
  attention to these specific characteristics as you continue to take your
  business to the next level.


  So what are they?

  ### Ready, Fire, Aim


  > "The Ready, Fire, Aim concept is about velocity, about the profound benefits
  of moving from an idea into action at the fastest possible speed. But Ready,
  Fire, Aim doesn’t mean reckless abandon. It doesn’t mean bolting into action
  before you are ready. It’s Ready, Fire, Aim, not Fire at Will."- Ready, Fire,
  Aim, page 181


  Along with focusing on the specific opportunity for your particular stage of
  growth, Michael also has one central method for success, which can be, and
  should be, applied in all stages of growth. It’s called _Ready, Fire, Aim_.
  And it’s something that Michael advises us to apply to the product development
  side of the business.


  **Get Ready** I’m sure you’re well aware of the “practice beats theory”
  approach when it comes to business (or any life experience for that matter).
  And that’s the same philosophy Michael believes in as well.


  But, before he actually _Fires_, he insists on asking seven key questions in
  the _Ready_ phase. In fact, Michael even uses these questions to create a
  short business proposal (maximum four pages) for any new start-ups he gets
  involved in. And he insists that this be completed within 24 hours from the
  time you have your idea.


  1.  **Do I have a good idea?** You will never know how good your product is
  until you actually test it, but “it pays to take a moment to ask this.”

  2.  **Does it feel like it will work?** “Given a choice between (a)
  methodically analyzing whether a business idea is good enough to be successful
  in the marketplace and (b) relying on the intuition of an experienced person,
  I’d opt for intuition.

  3.  **Are my sales targets realistic?** Spend some time doing “What if I’m
  wrong?” calculations (i.e. double the estimated cost of bringing the idea to
  life, then reduce your estimated units sold by half, and if it still looks
  like you’ll make a profit, go forward).

  4.  **Can I afford to test this idea?** If it’s a costly idea, maybe testing
  in a controlled environment first is best.

  5.  **Do I know the basic tasks that need to be done?** Create a short list of
  the primary tasks that need to be completed.

  6.  **Do I have the people who can do the tasks?** You can’t always make it
  alone, so do you have the right people on board? Understand who you’ll need to
  involve when in the tasks you listed in Step 5.

  7.  **Do I have a Plan B, an exit plan, in case my good idea turns out to be a
  bad one?** Create a “What if it fails?” plan. Set your stop-loss points –
  “measurable points that determine, ahead of time, whether you will continue to
  invest money in the project or drop it.”


  **Fire!** At this point, don’t get caught up in the “just need to do one more
  thing” syndrome. You’ve answered the essential seven questions, so now _is_
  the time to _Fire!_


  **Aim** Continue to monitor your progress as you move forward and adjust as
  necessary.

  ### What Stage Are You In? Know Your Main Problem, Challenge and Opportunity


  > "Other issues matter as well, but if you know what to expect at each stage
  of the game and prepare yourself for those common problems, challenges, and
  opportunities, it will be much easier to reach the next level."- Ready, Fire,
  Aim, page 19


  At any point in time, you probably have what seems like an endless TO-DO list.
  So where should you focus your time, and more importantly, energy? Well that
  depends on what stage of growth you’re in. This is an area that Michael
  focuses on heavily in the book, breaking down each stage; but here is the main
  problem, challenge and opportunity at each stage based on his experience:


  **Stage One: Infancy – zero to $1 million in revenue**  

  Main Problem: You don’t really know what you are doing.  

  Main Challenge: Making the first profitable sale.  

  Main Opportunity: Achieving a minimum critical mass of customers


  _Skills Needed: (1) Getting things done and (2) selling._


  **Stage Two: Childhood – $1 million to $10 million in revenue**  

  Main Problem: You are only breaking even or may even be losing money.  

  Main Challenge: Creating many additional, profitable products quickly.  

  Main Opportunity: Increasing cash flow and becoming profitable.


  _Additional Skill Needed: Coming up with a constant stream of new and
  potentially tipping-point ideas._


  **Stage Three: Adolescence – $10 million to $50 million in revenue**  

  Main Problem: Your systems are strained, and customers are noticing.  

  Main Challenge: Turning the chaos into order.  

  Main Opportunity: Learning how to establish useful protocols and manage
  processes and procedures.


  _Additional Skill Needed: Running your business with just three or four simple
  management reports._


  **Stage Four: Adulthood – $50 million to $100 million in revenue**  

  Main Problem: Sales slow down and may even stall.  

  Main Challenge: Becoming entrepreneurial again.  

  Main Opportunity: Getting the business to run itself.


  _Additional Skill Needed: Determining the role you will play in the business’s
  future._

  _Ready, Fire, Aim_ not only provides insight on the early stages of
  entrepreneurial life, but also the corporate life that you may eventually lead
  to as an Entrepreneur aiming to create a multimillion-dollar business.

It’s every entrepreneur’s dream: to not only start and build your business from the ground up, but to someday take it to the heights of a multimillion-dollar level organization. Doing that with just one business is quite gratifying. But, doing it with multiple businesses is pretty special.

Michael Masterson falls into the latter category. Throughout his career, he’s been a part of several successful businesses, helping to “start and develop dozens of multimillion-dollar businesses, including one whose revenues exceeded $135 million and another still growing at $300 million.”

And it’s this experience that’s allowed him to identify the Four Stages of Growth.

_Ready, Fire, Aim_ not only provides insight on the early stages of entrepreneurial life, but also the corporate life that you may eventually lead to as an Entrepreneur aiming to create a multimillion-dollar business.

And although there is a heavy focus on strategy, revenue and profits, Michael clearly emphasizes one simple, yet equally significant fact: it’s not about you – it’s about your customers, and what’s best for them.
