  ### The Five Remembrances


  > "When we don’t run away from our suffering… liberation and enlightenment
  manifest."- Reconciliation, page 59


  Against the backdrop of his Vietnamese Buddhist monk traditions, we are
  introduced to these five realities about the impermanence of our time on
  planet Earth:


  1.  **I am of the nature to grow old.** I cannot escape old age.

  2.  **I am of the nature to have ill-health.** I cannot escape ill-health.

  3.  **I am of the nature to die.** I cannot escape dying.

  4.  **All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to
  change.** There is no way to escape being separated from them. I cannot keep
  anything. I came here empty-handed, and I go empty-handed.

  5.  **My actions are my only belongings.** I cannot escape the consequences of
  my actions. My actions are the ground on which I stand.


  Naturally, we all know life includes birth and death, sickness and old age. We
  don’t want to grow old, get sick and die, but life is life that. If we revolt
  against or suppress these truths, our unhappiness grows. If instead we were to
  spend a few moments daily contemplating that life contains not only fear of
  the dark but also peace from the light, our sense of well-being would
  ironically increase.

  ### The Karma of Thought, Speech and Action


  > "Whether our speech is right speech or wrong speech, it bears our
  signature."- Reconciliation, page 21


  Just as composers or painters are known to personally sign their artistry, so
  too when we produce a thought, it bears our earmark. In turn, our thinking
  forms the basis of our speech and actions. When we speak from anger or
  pessimism, our words create damage. Whatever we do to protect life, help
  others suffer less and express our comprehension is defined as “right action”.


  It’s obvious, right? So, why _is_ careful transmission of our thoughts in
  daily life of such vital import? Our individual thoughts, feelings and actions
  collectively determine our karmic future. Actions and speech are our
  continuation – handed down from generation to generation.


  That’s why each of us needs to do our part to transmute our own deep-rooted
  seeds of suffering using these three approaches:


  1.  **Focus on sowing and watering our seeds of our happiness.** We don’t work
  directly with the seeds of suffering but instead allow seeds of happiness to
  transform them. This is called indirect transformation.

  2.  **Deal with our afflictions by deliberately inviting them into our
  consciousness.** This implies welcoming the despair, regrets and longing that
  have been difficult for us to touch. We sit down and talk with them like old
  friends. It’s admittedly an act of courage, but very healing.

  3.  **Practice mindfulness continuously.** Undertake breathing exercises like
  the sixteen in groups of four that address the body, feelings, mind and
  perceptions. Our breath is the fastest way to transport ourselves to a
  different attitude. By trying out these easy practices for myself, I can
  attest why.


  Four elements comprise the “immeasurable heart”: loving kindness, compassion,
  joy and equanimity (or non-discrimination). With awareness, we can choose. We
  can end the cycle of suffering now. World peace begins with oneself.


  No matter one’s particular upbringing, faith tradition or beliefs, isn’t this
  worth striving for?

  ### Releasing Our Past


  > "Without mud, there can be no lotus flowers."- Reconciliation, page 32


  To urge us in these directions, the author recounts a story of the Buddha
  sitting in a forest surrounded by monks when a peasant comes by. His cows had
  just run away. Searching, the farmer asks if they were spotted. No. Smiling,
  the Buddha then declares: “Dear friends, you should be very happy. You don’t
  have any cows to lose.”


  One exercise we can do right away is to write down the names of our “cows”. We
  may at first see these things, people and situations as crucial to our
  well-being. Upon examination, we decide which are ready to be released, for
  they are obstacles to our genuine joy.


  Another opportunity is to imagine ourselves in a theater. While viewing a
  film, we may believe it’s a true story. In reality, the scenes are merely
  flickering light on a screen. In similar fashion, we become imprisoned by our
  past memories – like a sad movie on a continuous loop. We suffer anew. In
  fact, we’re capable of stopping the projection anytime in the present. Such is
  the power of mindfulness and concentration.

> "We produce ourselves. We produce our future." _\- Reconciliation, page 22_

Thomas Moore’s testimonial of _Reconciliation: Healing the Inner Child_ expresses this volume’s essence well: a “simple but penetrating perspective” on transforming our pain and confusion into clarity and strength is indeed provided. Within, Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh offers insights on how mindfulness and other practical techniques can bring reconciliation and allow joy plus tranquility to flourish.
