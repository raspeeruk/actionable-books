  ### Establishing Priorities


  > "I would recommend that each of you considers the questions I shared earlier
  that were posed to me not so long ago. First: What would you like people to
  say at your funeral? And then look at what might be the toughest question:
  What would your children say at your funeral? If the answers don’t line up
  with your dreams, maybe it’s time to examine your definition of success – and
  the priorities you associate with that definition."- Redefining Success,
  Chapter 3


  You may recall in Covey’s [_Seven
  Habits_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/)
  the first question above. I have gone through that exercise before, as I’m
  sure most of you have. What really moved me was the second question. Wilson
  digs deep into priorities throughout his book and explains how his were much
  different before and after that exercise. I’m afraid he isn’t alone.


  Some people dive head first into their jobs making it their number one
  priority. Typically we think of entrepreneurs or people who are heavily
  invested in their jobs, but more and more people are putting work before
  everything. Wilson shares a story that was incredibly moving where he was home
  one evening “babysitting” his kids and working in his home office, which he
  was extremely bitter about. He should have been at his office working, so he
  thought. He was bidding on an expensive piece of art in an auction that he
  really wanted, a piece of art that “I couldn’t imagine living without.” The
  auction house was to call him if he was outbid giving him an opportunity to
  increase his bid. The phone rang several times that evening but was quickly
  answered by one of his children, so Wilson assumed it was for them as they
  didn’t come to get him. The auction close time came and went and Wilson hadn’t
  heard from the auction house so he called them and was told that he had been
  outbid. When asked why they hadn’t called him, the auctioneer replied they
  had, but were told by Wilson’s children that he wasn’t home.


  He lost it. He ran down the hall to his daughter’s room and exploded! His
  daughter crawled under the bed for protection from his verbal abuse. Finally
  she said that she wasn’t aware that he was home…because he never is.


  Wilson does a much better job than I of explaining his emotions that night and
  what followed, but believe me, it was powerful. He admits that he can’t even
  recall what the art piece was now, it was truly that insignificant.


  His children would have answered question two above with the response that he
  was a successful businessman, but probably wouldn’t say he was a great father.
  That moved him to make some changes. In the book he lists his six priorities:


  1\. **Personal health: Emotional, Physical, Intellectual** – If you don’t have
  time to take care of yourself now when you are “so busy”, how are you going to
  find the time to do it when you are sick? When he had prostate cancer he was
  the partner in a small, but successful firm that he thought couldn’t run
  without him. When he took time off, he discovered that it could. He also
  realized that he needed to be there to take care of his family, so his health
  was priority one.


  2\. **Family** – The members of your family give you your core relationships
  and they need unconditional love and support, the same which you would expect
  from them. It’s not always easy he admits, but it’s always worth a try.


  3\. **Friends** – They are the essence of life. For many entrepreneurs, the
  journey can be a lonely one as you are putting in many hours and the people
  who aren’t in sync with your schedule will eventually become tired of waiting.
  Make time for your friends and surround yourself with like-minded folks.


  4\. **Education** – Never stop learning. Wilson says that one of the reasons
  he invests in some companies on Dragon’s Den is just so he can learn more
  about that industry/business. Time spent learning is never wasted. Even making
  mistakes is learning and helps create experience which we can never have
  enough of.


  5\. **Career** – Wilson has realized a great deal of financial success in the
  past and can now spend less time working. It’s safe to say that his career is
  established and on solid footing so putting career near the bottom of his list
  is easier for him than an entrepreneur who is early in their career. That said
  – which of the four priorities above do you bump down? Tough, isn’t it?


  6\. **Community** – “We all have opportunities to give back in whatever way we
  choose, be it through time, money, or the combination of time money and
  creativity”, Wilson says. More on this in insight #1.

  ### Get Checked


  > "As a prostate cancer ‘graduate’ I have made awareness and early detection a
  major theme of my philanthropic work. My message is to get checked sooner than
  later. Information won’t kill you, but ignorance could."- Redefining Success,
  Chapter 3


  This may quite possibly be the shortest insight in Actionable Books history,
  while also being the most important. Don’t dismiss it because you are a woman
  either – you all have a man in your life somewhere ladies.


  Wilson got prostate cancer at 44. The Cancer Society suggests you get checked
  at 50. As he says, if he had listened to their advice, he’d be dead. In Canada
  one in six men will develop prostate cancer, the most common cancer to affect
  Canadian males (I would imagine the numbers are similar in the US). Early
  detection is the best way to survive, so if you’re over 35 get checked. It’s
  easy. More info here:

  ### Philanthropy Is Good Business


  > "I have always given out of a sense of opportunity, with the goal of not
  only making my community better, but making my company bigger as well. I know
  that some people object to the notion of getting something from giving. But
  businesses should expect a return on their charitable donations."- Redefining
  Success, Chapter 8


  Before you dismiss such an idea, Wilson asks us to think about this:
  charitable giving that in turn reaps an economic return creates stronger
  companies that can make more meaningful contributions to their communities in
  the long run. Wilson quotes a figure that fewer than one in thirty Canadian
  businesses claimed any charitable donations at all; on average the rest gave
  less than one percent of pre-tax profits. Wilson suggests you donate 2.5% of
  pre-tax profits and treat it like a marketing budget.


  Some ways to help your business when donating to charity:


  1\. **Getting Noticed** – Send the cheque directly to the CEO or executive
  director of the charity, with a copy going to the second-in-command as well.
  He would also send a copy of each cheque to selected board members, clients,
  potential clients, and competitors who were known supporters of the charity.
  Instead of getting lumped in with all of the other donors, for the cost of the
  letter, they were able to build brand awareness.


  2\. **Leverage** – Instead of taking on the cost of running a big charity
  event (dinner/gala/concert, etc.) partner up with a company that also serves
  your clients, but is not a competitor. Wilson’s firm teamed up with a large
  accounting firm in Calgary to put on some large events. This gave what Wilson
  calls “brand rub” where your brand rubs up against a bigger, established brand
  so you can get some exposure.


  3\. **The Manitoba Flood** – In the spring of ‘97 the Red River severely
  flooded and Wilson’s firm, FirstEnergy, wanted to help so they donated their
  trade commissions for one day to the flood victims. On a normal day, that
  would total about $100k, but since they told everyone what they were doing,
  they raised $450k. Now here’s where this really sings: a couple of days after
  his event, the Calgary Flames and the Calgary Herald were doing a joint
  fundraiser event – a concert – at the Saddledome. Wilson reached out to the
  Flames and asked if they would like to roll all of their donations together –
  he had $450k, remember. The Flames said yes and FirstEnergy presented their
  big cheque on stage at the end of the concert. Together they made headlines
  across Canada as they had raised well over half a million for the flood.


  4\. **Charity Cheques** – FirstEnergy runs several events where they pay for
  the food, beverage, venue and entertainment and then invite
  contacts/connections/industry folks to show up. The price of admission is a
  cheque filled out to the charity. No cheque, no entry. The cheque should be
  equal to “whatever you would spend on a fine dinner with a great bottle of
  wine.” When they started they would raise $12k per event, now they raise about
  $250k at each event. Nice!
f_conclusion: >-
  The book lists a few of Wilson’s mistakes that he has learned from in the
  past. I was hoping for more, but there is a key learning from each which I
  found helpful. The afterword by Keith Hanna does a great job of summing up the
  book and gives a different perspective on its contents.

> "In many ways, cancer was the best thing that could have happened to me because it truly forced me to slow down and think about how I was living. Cancer may have saved my life. Cancer allowed me to say no to every request for my time." _\- Redefining Success, Chapter 3_

When I first saw Brett Wilson on _Dragons’ Den_, I became a fan. His laid back, calm, straightforward but positive approach to the many people who were baring their soul on national TV was inspiring. Nothing against some of the negative panelists (read: “Kevin O’Leary”), but I learned something from Brett in every show, not only how to be a better entrepreneur, but how to be a better person. When I attended a keynote from Wilson’s Life Coach Keith Hanna a few months ago, I put this book on my list of must-reads.

Wilson’s book _Redefining Success: Still Making Mistakes_ has two key takeaways. One: Slow down. Work is important and stuff needs to get done, but it’s not priority one. It’s actually priority five on a list of six in Wilson’s world (more on that in a minute). Two: Use your connections, money, smarts, and time to make a difference now, not when you pass away and leave some of your estate to charity. Your legacy needs to begin now, not when you die.

As I mentioned off the top – I was a fan of Brett Wilson before I read his book. His approach to life, his ability to see through things, his understanding of people, and his sense of giving is such that I want to be more like him. He’s made mistakes, and still does, but his approach to life is refreshing and motivating. Thanks, Brett.

Do you think that a business should gain from donating to charity?
