  ### Zeal involves risk


  > "To refire is not simply to stop or start working, or take a class, or to
  finally lose that twenty pounds. It’s an ongoing process of approaching things
  with gusto, taking risks, and bringing enthusiasm and zest to every area of
  your life."- Refire! Don’t Retire, page 135


  To serve as a common narrative thread, the book tells the story of a
  fictitious couple who had lost much of their enthusiasm for day-to-day living.
  They found themselves saying the same things, thinking the same thoughts and
  rarely, if ever, navigating outside of their normal routines. It’s a situation
  many of us find ourselves in.


  With professional guidance and willing friends, this couple partnered with
  those same friends to become a “last-minute gang” that acted more
  spontaneously. Eventually, this group took the next step by becoming a
  “refiring gang” that actively sought out risk-taking, gusto-seeking
  experiences.


  While I found the story’s characters to be flat and the dialogue somewhat
  stilted, the underlying principle came through: We need to take more risks if
  we’re going to approach life with gusto. How often do we find ourselves
  willingly choosing not to be spontaneous so we can follow the same, tired
  patterns of behavior?

  ### Feedback is the breakfast of champions


  > "We can’t keep growing emotionally if we isolate ourselves from others.
  Feedback is the breakfast of champions. If you really get to know others well,
  you’ll grow close enough that they’ll be willing to praise you when you’re fun
  to hang around with and give you honest feedback when you’re being obnoxious
  or a stick in the mud."- Refire! Don’t Retire, pages 31-32


  According to the authors, getting honest feedback is yet another risky
  endeavor that yields impressive dividends. Most of us, of course, prefer not
  to make ourselves vulnerable in this way. We love to hear the praise, but who
  really wants to be told they’re a stick in the mud?


  To avoid hearing _any_ negative feedback, we tend to isolate ourselves from
  others instead of actively seeking and developing strong, healthy
  relationships. Once we form these relationships, Blanchard and Shaevitz urge
  us to seek out honest, forthright, pull-no-punches feedback. This becomes the
  “breakfast of champions” because it provides needed sustenance on our refiring
  journeys.

  ### Bring one of your old passions back to life


  > "Make a list of the things that used to excite you—for example, acting,
  photography, model building, poetry, or writing. How can you bring one of
  these passions back to life."- Refire! Don’t Retire, page 73


  As part of refiring intellectually, Blanchard and Shaevitz encourage us to be
  open to learn, be a reader, be teachable, be courageous and be persistent. All
  of this is obviously great advice, especially in a world where it’s easy to
  know what we’ve always known, do what we’ve always done and live in isolation
  from anything that differs from our personal norms.


  Being open to the new, however, was not the refiring advice that most
  intrigued me. Rather, it was the authors’ encouragement to look back to move
  forward. At a certain age, it becomes far all too easy to forget some of those
  activities that once added zest and meaning to life. Refiring is about
  bringing those old passions back to life.


  For me, that would mean a return to the simple, long-forgotten pleasures of a
  good crossword puzzle. I used to love sitting down over a cup of coffee and
  completing—or at least trying to complete—the _USA Today_, _Chicago Tribune_
  or _New York Times_ crossword. It was more than just mental diversion. It was
  mental stimulation.


  What old passion needs to be brought back to life in your life?

  the burden on me, the reader, to find what’s there to be found. My inner cynic
  can’t gripe that “this story is too one-dimensional” or “this take on

  forced to identify the key actionable takeaway, as well as two specific ways

> "We’ve found conclusive evidence that achievements and accumulation of wealth do not make people happy…there’s plenty of emphasis on success in our culture. I’m finding we have to help people focus on significance as well." _\- Refire! Don’t Retire, page 16_

Early in _Refire! Don’t Retire_, Ken Blanchard and Morton Shaevitz slip in a word that has fallen out of common usage.

That word is zeal. Seriously, how many times have you used that word in the last six months?

The specific sentence, “what are you doing out of habit rather than zeal,” is just one of many soul-searching questions posed throughout the book. But for me, that one word stands out because it captures the essence of what both authors are trying to convey on each page.

A quick online search defines zeal as “great energy or enthusiasm in pursuit of a cause or objective.” And for Blanchard and Shaevitz, the objective is not success. It’s significance. They structure their book around four keys that will help make the rest of our lives the best of our lives:

1.  **_Refiring Emotionally_** puts the focus on revitalizing relationships and creating new ones.
2.  **_Refiring Intellectually_** stresses openness to learning opportunities in every situation.
3.  **_Refiring Physically_** places emphasis on overcoming obstacles that keep us from healthier lifestyles.
4.  **_Refiring Spiritually_** occurs when we’re “aware, forgiving, grateful, accepting and humble.”

Throughout, the authors provide solid, practical advice on how to combine all of the keys in a way that gives equal attention to every part of our lives. A short checklist at the end of each chapter encourages readers to “pause, reflect and take action.”
