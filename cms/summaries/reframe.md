  ### Where are all the great ideas?


  > "Companies block innovation by starting with what they want to create, not
  with what people need."- Reframe, page 54


  Let’s start with a real example. At Disney World, there are buses to bring
  people from the resorts to the park. Most of the time, when they arrive, they
  are already so packed that you cannot get a seat and you have to wait for the
  next one, with no idea about how long it will take to arrive. When thinking
  about this situation, many potential solutions come to mind. What if Disney
  provided real-time electronic bus schedules with seat availability? What if
  the park had a handle on supply and demand and increased the number of buses
  during the busiest times of day? What if they had entertainment while people
  are waiting, so the wait would be part of the experience?


  If you think about who, above everyone else in the park, is the most in tune
  with this problem, you immediately think of the bus driver. Patel encountered
  this situation when she herself visited Disney, and asked the driver once she
  finally got on the bus. Je already had already considered most of the ideas
  above and even more, but he hadn’t told anyone. Why?


  There are three factors at play here:


  *   Fears and other psychological barriers (_internal influencers_)

  *   Corporate blocks and barriers (_external influencers_)

  *   BS Excuse Personas (_the sum of your fears and blocks_)


  The ability to ideate, explore, identify, assess, pivot, and receive feedback
  is critical to innovation. Fear is the driving force against this agility, and
  by conquering individual fears, we can collectively shift work culture from
  fearful to brave and innovative. The fears that we encounter most often in the
  research, design and innovation space are the ones below:


  *   The unknown

  *   Losing autonomy

  *   Rejection

  *   Change

  *   Failure

  *   Commitment


  In addition to the fears that each one of us brings to the table, business
  structures and rules also create blocks to creativity. The first block is that
  companies don’t create the room or permission for ideas to come about. It’s
  not in the schedule and they don’t have a line item in the agenda. The second
  block is money. Companies try too quickly to map innovation and ideation
  practices to revenue. And third, companies start with what they want to
  create, not with what people need.


  So, when we ask, “Why isn’t innovation happening?”, we can look at the sum of
  all fears and blocks. However, they all represent nothing more than a pile of
  excuses, all of which can be overcome simply by recognizing them, deciding to
  take a stand, and coming up with ways to get around them.

  ### Just do it


  > "Open exploration grants you permission to get lost, constraints give
  parameters to work within."- Reframe, page 156


  People have closed, biased perspectives and are not seeing the problem or
  opportunity clearly. This all changes with reframing. Designing a new frame
  around the same circumstances allows new perspectives and ideas to emerge. The
  author proposes what she calls the Reframework_,_ a set of eight modules that
  you can choose from depending on the type of business problem you have and the
  answers you need.


  Step 1: The Real Problem  

  Step 2: A Different Lens  

  Step 3: Ask What If  

  Step 4: Funnel Vision  

  Step 5: Themes  

  Step 6: BS Excuse Personas  

  Step 7: Rapid Refine  

  Step 8: Execute


  Taken one by one, below are the biggest challenges encountered at each stage.


  **Step 1: Define the real problem  

  **Here we can use the Problem Brief, that consists in reframing the problem in
  four parts as follows: the Problem Space (reality that prevents the goal/state
  to be achieved), the Goal Space (desired outcome/situation), the Consequence
  (what’s going to change when the problem is solved), and the Gaps and Barriers
  (reasons why the problem hasn’t been solved yet).


  **Step 2: Use a different lens  

  **Put yourself in the other protagonist’s shoes and see the problem from
  another perspective.


  **Step 3: Ask questions to frame the future  

  **The central part of the process that will bring the most creative and
  innovative ideas to the table.


  **Step 4: Narrow down your ideas  

  **Make all ideas visible and use a method to classify and narrow them down.


  **Step 5: Identify the themes  

  **Step back and build categories of solutions.


  **Step 6: Deal with people’s fears and beliefs  

  **Make sure everybody can express their fears and beliefs and help them
  address the tension points before moving forward. If you let them, excuses
  will hold you back.


  **Step 7: Refine  

  **Once the excuses are handled, refine the idea together.


  **Step 8: Ship!  

  **Execute the idea.

  ### Creative openers to problem solving


  > "Dig deeper into why you can’t do something. Usually, you can, you are just
  choosing not to."- Reframe, page 117


  Creative people are constantly questioning the things they see and experience,
  questioning assumptions, authority, reality, and the status quo. But questions
  can be tricky. The way you ask a question can impact the answer you get.


  Open questions provide people with opportunities to share deeper-level
  thoughts, beliefs and opinions. These lead to eight “creative openers” that
  contribute to asking questions that will bring powerful and actionable
  answers.


  *   Why? _to define the problem_

  *   What if? _to get unstuck and create a space for creativity_

  *   Imagine if? _to really open up possibilities and dream big_

  *   What if I can’t? _to push beyond the doubts_

  *   What if I don’t? _to ground our efforts and clarify what’s at stake_

  *   What? _to explore the underlying issues_

  *   Why not? _to incite conversation and spark competitiveness_

  *   How about? _to comfortably dig deeper_


  Creative openers should not be used in all type of situations and they can
  even cause some unnecessary confusion and a diffused focus if you are looking
  for incremental change or to stop a pain point, for example.


  As long as you’re aware of the blocks that hinder innovation and creativity,
  you should be able to use common sense to determine when a creative opener
  would be useful. If you can ask open questions, listen, and empathize—you are
  well on your way to creative solution

  With _Reframe_, Mona Patel provides us with very concrete and directly
  applicable tools in our working environments, whether we are an independent or
  part of a large company. I am convinced that something is holding you back
  from making a change. Take some time to think about it, as well as the
  solutions are available to you by exploiting the various tools proposed by the
  author.
