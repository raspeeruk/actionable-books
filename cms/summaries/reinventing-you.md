  ### What’s Your Story?


  > "You have to explain that it’s not about you; it’s about the value you
  bring."- Reinventing You, page 121


  As Clark says, “Everyone has passions and things they’d love to do… So how can
  you get people to care?” The key to getting supporters on board with a
  professional and personal rebrand, she says, is creating a narrative anchored
  in value, not whimsy or blind desire. An honest assessment of your reasoning,
  and a higher call than “because I feel like it,” will help you construct a
  compelling explanation that makes as much sense to you as it does for your
  customers and the network of connections who can help you find them.


  One important step is to draw connections between your past experience and
  your new present path, keeping in mind that you may need to think more deeply
  and creatively to make those connections seem logical. Clark gives examples of
  a poet-turned-management-consultant who credited her in-depth knowledge of
  language with allowing her to pick up on nuances and undertones that others
  might not, or of a military helicopter pilot who branded her experience as an
  ability to manage expensive assets in high pressure situations for her
  business school application.


  In both cases, seemingly disparate career paths were connected through a
  narrative thread that found and emphasized their commonalities. While there
  are other steps to preparing for and executing your professional rebrand,
  constructing a logical narrative around your shift will be key to pulling all
  of those other actions together.

  ### Content Is Key


  > "This is your chance to let people judge you based on the quality of the
  material you produce, not on your past history of credentials."- Reinventing
  You, page 156


  Creating content and establishing yourself as an authority in your new field
  is a key part of helping to establish a new brand for yourself, and Clark
  offers plenty of actionable ideas to demonstrate your new brand and expertise.
  Many of the ideas leverage your own channels, but some also call on
  partnerships with other channels to help validate your new expertise. Among
  her suggestions for managing the roll-out of a new identity as an expert:


  *   Schedule social media posts in advance — a combination of original
  thoughts, links to your own content, and links to relevant industry content —
  and then check in daily to add timely perspective and responses.

  *   Begin keeping track of blog topics or ideas in a notebook or on your phone
  so you always have fresh ideas, personal anecdotes and more to fuel the
  creation of new blog posts on a regular basis.

  *   Identify relevant industry publications you can guest post on, and send
  detailed, specific, and well-researched pitches to those publications to help
  get your name out there with your new brand attached.

  ### Don’t Go It Alone


  > "Everyone has a personal brand, whether some skeptics want to admit it or
  not: there’s no such thing as opting out."- Reinventing You, page 13


  If you’re a person existing in this world, then there are people who have a
  perception about you, and the reality is, that perception may not be what you
  think or what you like. Before you can change your brand, you first need to
  get an accurate read of how you’re being perceived, and that can only come
  from others.


  Clark gives several suggestions for ways to collect this invaluable
  information, from hiring a professional coach to conduct “360 interviews” of
  your close friends and colleagues, to conducting your own research through
  interviews, focus groups and detailed reviews of your online presence and past
  performance reviews. She offers some questions to keep in mind or to ask
  directly to help get a clear and complete sense of your brand:


  *   What are my strengths, and what are my weaknesses?

  *   What are three words used to describe me?

  *   I’m trying to go from X to Y; what steps would you suggest for me?

  *   Who are some people who have some of the qualities I should be trying to
  build?

  *   What are my blind spots?
f_conclusion: >-
  With modern tools available to help professionals research new industries,
  connect with possible mentors, learn new skills, create new online branding
  materials for themselves, and push out relevant content, reinventing yourself
  has never been easier. There’s no reason to spend your life in a job you hate.
  Through a conscious examination of your current perception and careful effort
  to re-align that perception with what you want it to be, professionals can
  take an active role in evolving the job they’re in into the one they’ve always
  wanted to be in.

> "This book is an invitation to ask what you want out of life." _\- Reinventing You, page 3_

Thanks to digitization, globalization, the decline of professional mentorship and a host of other factors, more professionals are reinventing themselves than ever before. A rebrand can help professionals looking to enhance their reputation inside their current company — to help them land a promotion or transition to a new division — but it also helps many professionals prepare to take the next step, either to a bigger role at a different company or out into a different industry altogether.

And regardless of whether you’re pursuing a career change as a result of an external force like a layoff, or an internal factor like a desire to chase a childhood dream, there have never been more tools available to help you accomplish that reinvention. In _Reinventing You: Define Your Brand, Imagine Your Future_, Clark walks through the steps for exploring your desired career, assessing your current state and skillset, preparing for the change, filling in your knowledge gaps, shifting your network to reflect your new role and more.
