  ### We Have the Solutions


  > "Just as the technology was already available in the 1960s for space travel,
  today we already have the knowledge and the means to alleviate the human
  suffering that has become the hallmark of our time of extremes. We already
  have the ability to feed every man, woman, and child living on this planet. We
  already have affordable, clean, and sustainable forms of energy that can be
  made available to every household that needs them."- Resilience from the
  Heart, page 163


  Braden invites us to consider the facts of today and to explore what they
  mean. If we’re honest with ourselves and acknowledge that the world is
  changing, then it makes sense that our stories must change as well.


  All that stands between us and a better world, is the thinking that makes room
  in our lives for what is in fact already is available to us. We must ask
  ourselves: are we willing to embrace the thinking that makes such
  possibilities a priority? To transform our time of extremes, we must have the
  courage to heal the crisis of thinking. From the facts available to us today
  it’s obvious that elements for big solutions already exist. What is lacking is
  the shift in thinking that makes such goals a priority.


  The key to change is to make the object of our vision a priority in our lives.
  Each of us, by engaging in a few simple actions to help the environment and
  disadvantaged people, can make a contribution and potentially influence others
  we know to do the same. Before the tipping point of no return, nature gives us
  the opportunity to turn crisis into transformation. This fact is the good news
  that helps us to recognize opportunities for change when they appear in our
  lives.

  ### Accessing Heart Intelligence


  > "Growing evidence suggests that the heart and the brain work together to
  share the role of the body's master organs – two separate organs connected
  through a common network of information...Creating a heart-brain coherence
  empowers us to experience deep states of intuition and to do so on demand."-
  Resilience from the Heart, pages 11 and 25


  What’s important here is to listen to your body and to learn how it
  communicates with you. This ability to perceive and create harmony in the body
  is a preparation that allows us to be at our best for whatever we choose to
  pursue. The key to our transformation is simply this: the better we know
  ourselves, the better equipped we are to make our choices wisely.


  Hereby it’s of critical importance to recognize the distinction between
  heart-based intuition and what we know as our experience of instinct. Instinct
  is nature’s way of informing us in the present, based upon experiences in the
  past. Without a doubt, our instincts can powerfully serve us in certain
  situations. Heart intelligence, on the other hand, is instant and fast, based
  on the present time of the moment. The heart knows with unwavering certainty.
  Our task and practice is to merge and reconcile the two experiences into
  coherence.


  The steps to coherence are as simple as focus, feel, and breathe. The heart
  and brain are always in some state of coherence but due to the chaos of daily
  life and the presence of negative emotions, our coherence levels may be low.
  More coherence leads to greater resilience.


  Resilience is the possibility to create turning points that minimize the
  impact of abrupt change and shorten the time it takes to recover when hardship
  occurs. We create wiser and better solutions.


  Resilience is found on two levels: personal resilience and community
  resilience. When we try to describe precisely what a community looks like, we
  find there are many variations. A community is all about us, it’s about
  everyday life and the way we live it and that includes our organizations and
  businesses too. Regardless of its shape or reason of forming, two keys must be
  present for any community to be successful: a common vision and a common bond.


  The resilience that we develop as individuals becomes even more effective,
  powerful, and potent when it can be applied by our families, friends and
  co-workers. It’s no secret that we’re already a global community: the
  challenges experienced in one part of the world are rarely limited to that
  part of the world. We share everything, including the hardships and effects of
  an unsustainable economy or extreme weather conditions.

  ### Make an Honest Assessment


  > "Our reluctance to accept that the changes exist may even compromise our
  ability to adapt – we can only cope with changes that we acknowledge."-
  Resilience from the Heart, page 126


  As creatures of habit, we tend to reflect today the way we lived life at a
  particular time in our past. So many of the old ways of thinking are no longer
  enough to meet the needs of our transforming world. We tend to put our lives
  on hold until that familiar world returns. While we’re waiting for the normal
  to return, we remain unconscious of the way life is now. Our reluctance to
  accept that the changes exist may even compromise our ability to adapt – we
  can only cope with changes that we acknowledge.


  How can we thrive in a new world if we put our attention on waiting for the
  old world to return? There never was a better time than now, to be honest with
  ourselves about what we’re up against. Do we embrace the change or do we hold
  on to our old habits and patterns of thinking which might not be sustainable
  anymore?


  We have two possible ways to deal with the reality of a shifting world. We can
  choose either to (1) discount the facts that tell us the world has changed,
  and that we need to think and live differently, leaving ourselves and our
  organizations vulnerable to the new conditions or (2) be honest with ourselves
  about the volatility that comes from the convergences of extremes, and to
  learn to adapt our thinking and ways of life to minimize the negative impacts
  of the change.

  You might ask yourself what the answers might be to our life’s extraordinary
  challenges. Are you willing to accept an honest answer based on the reality of
  our world today, or are you hoping to confirm an opinion that you have already
  formed for yourself?

  "Both science and indigenous wisdom remind us that we’re part of all that we
  see. This means that we’re a part of the solutions as well. The key is that we
  must first shift our perspective so we can recognize our connection.”

There’s a question we ask ourselves each and every day. Mostly it lingers unconsciously in the back of our mind as a nagging sense of something unfinished or incomplete in our life: how do I make life better for myself and my family? The answer to this question is precisely what the book, _Resilience from the Heart: The Power to Thrive in Life’s Extremes_ by Gregg Braden is all about. It shows us through inspiring stories and evidence-based examples why resilience is so necessary. Within the pages of this book, you’ll find a comprehensive guide and resources to help you embrace the biggest challenges in life in a healthy way. The book provides simple methods and applications for a resilient life, career, and business.

You might ask yourself what the answers might be to our life’s extraordinary challenges. Are you willing to accept an honest answer based on the reality of our world today, or are you hoping to confirm an opinion that you have already formed for yourself?

Whether we’re talking about the future of next week or that of the next generation, the key is that whatever becomes of our world and lives, the transformation begins with us, the individual.

How can we deal with the issues unless we’re willing to acknowledge the situation? Our willingness to think differently will be the key to the success of our journey. We must go from simply surviving change to thriving through change. Once we’re in this space of balance and harmony within ourselves in our hearts and minds, we can create harmony with the world beyond it.

How are you cultivating more resilience in your life?
