  ### Tactics that Fit Your Schedule


  > "But we all know that the most rewarding part of preparing for a trip occurs
  once the itinerary is set and the planning is done; when you know what to
  expect and can focus on how to make an already great schedule a terrific
  experience."- Retain and Gain, page 20


  Once you’ve decided to embark on a career management journey, it’s time to
  choose your tactics. For busy managers (which, let’s be honest, is almost all
  of them), it can be challenging to fit career management into a hectic
  schedule. Taylor maps out three paths, depending on how much time you have.
  Here are a few of my favorite ideas:


  If you’ve got 10 minutes: Call in a team member for a chat that is not related
  to checking in on projects or daily updates. Talk candidly about what they are
  thinking about and interested in, both personally and professionally. This is
  an opportunity to establish candor, and learn a bit more about your team. The
  more you know about the people working with you, the better you will be able
  to support their long-term goals for their careers.


  If you’ve got an hour: Share an article or tool that focuses on soft skills
  that will help your team achieve their goals. You could also share a TedTalk
  or other online video, or a podcast episode. Spend an hour chatting with your
  team about how they can apply those principles to their work, or to their
  long-term goals. Encourage team members to share their knowledge and skills
  with each other.


  If you’ve got a half day: Create a detailed plan for how you will support your
  team moving forward. While financial incentives are powerful motivators, there
  are many other opportunities that you can provide that will help them develop
  their skills, boost their credibility, and contribute to the team in new ways.
  Attending an industry conference, going on a trip, being publicly recognized
  for their work, or being given opportunities to work on challenging new
  projects are all highly motivating tactics to keep employees engaged and
  progressing toward their goals.

Be supportive and understanding of difficult circumstances—your employees are sure to appreciate it."

  ### Stop Trying to Provide Stairs


  > "10 years ago \[careers were like\] stairs, but now people can have so many
  careers it’s hard to say but a trip or a journey best describes it.”"- Retain
  and Gain, page 16


  The landscape of work has shifted dramatically in recent years—there is no
  longer an expectation for employees to work their way up through an
  organization in a linear fashion. Of course, employees want to be compensated
  fairly, and they want to feel a sense of progression in their careers, but
  it’s not as simple as a straight line up.


  More and more, people are seeking work that has meaning, that makes them feel
  engaged and challenged, and that encourages them to contribute to something
  greater than themselves. Having a clear career management strategy will help
  you retain staff—people will no longer feel that they need a new position to
  be challenged or valued.


  One great way to do this is allow staff to move between departments. Ask a
  member of the marketing team to sit in on an sales meeting. Ask your financial
  controller with a writing hobby to look over new copy. Not only is asking for
  input an easy way to make people feel heard and valued, it can also strengthen
  your results by taking into account new perspectives.

  Career management is often perceived as difficult for business owners and
  managers, but it doesn’t have to be. Furthermore, it’s a sound investment that
  can help keep employees engaged—which moves the needle on just about any
  business metric you care to measure. For career management to be effective,
  organizations need to establish a culture that values candor, transparency,
  and frequent conversations. If your team doesn’t feel safe sharing their long
  term goals and personal interests, you will struggle to make progress. _Retain
  and Gain_ will arm you with the tools you need to embark on your career
  management journey.

_Retain and Gain: Career Management for Small Businesses_ by Lisa Taylor is a practical, hands-on manual for organizations and managers seeking strategies to keep their employees engaged and excited in their work through better career management. Career management is a tricky subject for many managers, as it requires open conversations about the long term goals of employees, which may not be related to the organization. As a result, many people simply ignore this crucial component of engaging with their teams. It’s hard to hear that your exciting new hire has a long-term plan to work in a different industry, or achieve a level of success that won’t be available to them via your organization. It’s even harder to create a culture where employees feel comfortable sharing those goals without being worried about being penalized for them. _Retain and Gain_ offers highly actionable tactics to help managers and organizations develop a career management strategy that will result in a more engaged workforce. Laid out as a travel guide, and spanning a slim 60 pages, this book is a perfect companion for even the most time starved managers.
