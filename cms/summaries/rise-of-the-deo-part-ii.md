  ### Designing Culture is the New Craft


  > "DEOs believe that the success of a business lies in its people and their
  powerful, meaningful connections to one another."- Rise of the DEO, page 14


  The authors make the point that culture must be _crafted._ In fact, 80% of
  companies do not intentionally craft their company culture. Here’s a sample of
  other ingredients that belong to the new craft of designing creative
  organizations:


  *   **Social Intelligence:** Is empathy a part of the culture code? Is your
  culture an environment where meaningful relationships and creativity thrives?

  *   **Systems Thinking:** Can people anticipate emerging forces, patterns, and
  trends on the world stage? Can they make sense of unseen influences and
  engineer their future course of action?

  *   **Co-Creation:** How do people from different disciplines work together to
  create great things?

  *   **Taking Risks:** Do you allow small bets, useful disruption, and
  experimentation?

  *   **Expertise:** Do you allow yourself and others to evolve their processes,
  values, and skills? What about possessing both expertise and “the beginner’s
  mind?”

  *   **Permission to Fail:** Is experimentation allowed? Partial successes? Are
  systems built to report mistakes and convert them into actionable company
  wisdom?

  *   **Iterations:** Are your products, services, and culture allowed to grow?
  Do you build minimum viable products and evolve them through time?

  *   **Playful Work:** Do you make play a part of everyday productivity and
  skill-building? Do you see playful work as amplifiers to “social, emotional,
  and cognitive development?”


  Each chapter has a few pages that elaborates on each topic. When one of those
  ingredients is missing, just imagine the consequences.

  ### Crafting Towards Originality


  > "Original. This coveted description brands jeans, art, recipes, and even
  sin. It signifies something unique and not derivative, something rare or
  noteworthy. Originality is what others are drawn to copy or driven to acquire.
  But for a DEO, originality isn't a quest or a creative goal. For a DEO, being
  an original is the only option."- Rise of the DEO, page 174


  Originality isn’t eccentricism or rebellion for its own sake. It’s not paying
  empty lip service, or claiming the title just because the word is popular and
  fashionable. That’s what imitators do.


  The authors note that originality emerges _naturally_ when one can understand
  the passions, talents, insights, and traits that make up her DNA. She doesn’t
  conform to predefined roles and stereotypes. If she has aptitudes that are
  contradictory, so be it: She finds ways to make paradox exist in harmony. She
  may know vulnerability, fear, and isolation in the beginning of her career,
  but she knows that the only way forward is with faith and action.


  There are three unifying traits that originality requires:


  *   **Mastery:** The mastery of a discipline, trade, or craft that comes from
  years of study and practice. One revealing mark of mastery is the ability to
  take whatever’s old and turn it into something new and novel for their
  industry.

  *   **Adaptability:** The ability to apply various talents and skills to fit
  her surroundings without changing who she really is. If she learns something
  new, it’s to amplify her originality, as well as her company and its people.

  *   **Curiosity:** Curiosity is at the core of a DEO’s creativity because they
  know it leads to the greatest learning. It amplifies problem solving and
  uncovers hidden opportunities.

  ### Crafting Towards Co-Creation


  > "Some have described co-creation as a response to greater complexity or the
  need for greater efficiency. These definitions fit, but co-creation and the
  collaboration that it enables provides DEOs with a few notable superpowers."-
  Rise of the DEO, page 67


  We live in an age where society’s challenges are rarely solved by one
  discipline alone. Think of a product or service that required multiple rounds
  of feedback, iterations, and stakeholder input. Think of the collaboration
  between many disciplines to make them come to life. But is it really enough to
  “just do it,” “be creative” and enforce these attitudes? The authors reveal
  some clues on what design-inspired cultures _do_ differently:


  *   **Agile Development:** Adapt agile development (or even Lean Startup)
  concepts to your current processes.

  *   **Systems Thinking:** Know how your company makes sense of events,
  patterns, emerging trends, and unseen influences.

  *   **Wicked Problems:** The challenge you face isn’t isolated but part of a
  greater ecosystem of other connected challenges.

  *   **Diversity:** Rather than solitary genius, think group genius. There’s a
  wealth of research showing that most breakthroughs occur in groups, and when
  teams are varied in discipline, skillset, age, hobbies, expertise, and
  cognitive types. Look more into the value of being “T-Shaped.”

  *   **Problem Solving:** Back then, business schools were all about “the one
  right answer,” the hyper focus on convergent thinking. Now we need both
  divergent _and_ convergent thinking, and the guts to reframe the problem when
  our assumptions turn out wrong.


  When you make “design” a shared activity for everyone, enthusiasm for the
  future grows, fellow collaborators feel included and valued, and the illusion
  of silos _lift_.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Rise of the DEO: Leadership by Design_ is for all of us trying to grow and
  craft 21st century organizations. Today’s business challenges are an ecosystem
  of new design problems. That’s why it doesn’t pay to stay isolated, alone, and
  proceed with “business-as-usual.” That’s why there’s a huge leap in
  vocabulary, skillset, and method in what DEOs and their companies do.
f_quote-2: >-
  "For years, business acumen and creative ability have been siloed, united only
  at office parties and the occasional brainstorming session. But we live in a
  time that requires new leadership. We live in a time that requires people who
  look at every business challenge as a design problem solvable with the right
  mix of imagination and metrics."

We live in a time that requires people who look at every business challenge as a design problem solvable with the right mix of imagination and metrics." _\- Rise of the DEO, page 16_

_Rise of the DEO: Leadership by Design_, written by Maria Giudice and Christopher Ireland, makes a strong case for what the new creative leader will look like. Through a series prompts, statistics, and DEO interviews, they show where the drivers of change are taking us.

In the [previous summary](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/rise-of-the-deo/), we learned that design isn’t about _styling_, but how something works and functions. Design is about collective change. Aside from product and service design, this also extends to growing company cultures: How we work, relate, and collaborate together to make things happen. When leaders embrace this and make the mental shift, they find ways to grow it into their culture, too.

### Crafting Towards Originality

Originality isn’t eccentricism or rebellion for its own sake. It’s not paying empty lip service, or claiming the title just because the word is popular and fashionable. That’s what imitators do.

That’s why it doesn’t pay to stay isolated, alone, and proceed with “business-as-usual.” That’s why there’s a huge leap in vocabulary, skillset, and method in what DEOs and their companies do.

The authors assert that this conversation will carry on, and the people to carry it forward are the future design-inspired leaders, startup founders, creative leaders, and adaptive hybrid practitioners who want to see it through.

What role will _you_ play?
