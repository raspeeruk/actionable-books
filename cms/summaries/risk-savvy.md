  ### Understand the difference between risk and uncertainty


  > "In an uncertain world, it is impossible to determine the optimal course of
  action by calculating the exact risks. We have to deal with ‘unknown
  unknowns.’"- Risk Savvy, page 23


  Most people mistakenly assume that risk and uncertainty are one and the same,
  but they’re not. The difference is crucial to understanding the main theme of
  the book and can improve our decision process.


  A known risk, such as playing the casino slot machine, has many outcomes. The
  frequency and probability of all the possible combinations can be calculated,
  allowing the player to know ahead of time what his odds of winning are.
  Statistical thinking and logic are useful for these types of risks.


  An uncertainty, on the other hand, is when all the possible outcomes are
  unknown and the best option or choice cannot be calculated. Uncertainties
  include things such as when the next earthquake will occur, what direction the
  stock market will take tomorrow, or which romantic partner will be the best
  spouse over a lifetime. There are simply too many unknown factors to consider
  in these circumstances.


  The author believes that with uncertainties, good rules of thumb are helpful
  in making better choices.

  ### Trust your gut


  > "An intuition or gut feeling, is a judgment that appears quickly in
  consciousness, whose underlying reasons we are not fully aware of, yet is
  strong enough to act upon."- Risk Savvy, page 30


  Gut feelings arise from our past experiences and are part of our unconscious
  intelligence that has evolved over time. Gigerenzer explains it best when he
  says that “Having a gut feeling means that one feels what one should do,
  without being able to explain why.”


  The author believes the quality of decisions can improve by relying on our gut
  feeling more often. He cites the examples of professional athletes and
  experienced business leaders that depend on their gut and intuition much more
  often than admitted.


  Making intuition a more acceptable part of decision-making would reduce
  defensive decision-making. To overcome the corporate bias against intuition,
  the author suggests that business leaders come up with valid quantifiable
  reasons to support their choices made by intuition.

  ### Use rules of thumb to simplify decision-making


  > "To make good decisions in an uncertain world, one has to ignore part of the
  information, which is what rules of thumb do. Doing so can save time and
  effort and lead to better decisions."- Risk Savvy, page 40


  The author calls rules of thumb heuristics because they focus on one or a few
  pieces of information. Experts use less information than novices do, leading
  to better and faster decisions.


  So when would one use such a rule? One example he uses is at a new restaurant.
  His first rule of thumb when bombarded with options is to ask the waiter what
  he would eat. Take the waiter’s suggestion and save yourself the time from
  going back and forth with the menu trying to figure out the best option


  Another suggestion is what he calls “satisficing.” Satsficing is finding
  something that is good enough, not necessarily the best. Maximizing is the
  attempt to find the best possible choice. He refers to studies that show
  satisficers are more optimistic and have higher self-esteem than maximizers.
  He believes that “in an uncertain world there is no way to find the best.” The
  example used in this case would be shopping for a new shirt or channel surfing
  for something to watch on TV. Once you come across something you like, stop
  searching for something better.


  A more interesting example of using heuristics would be with the selection of
  a spouse. For this type of choice, the author asserts that you find the most
  important reason and ignore the rest. Once you meet someone that meets your
  criteria, stop searching.


  “Learning to live with a good-enough choice and the possibility that there is
  something better out there is necessary in an uncertain world. Food choice,
  shopping and watching TV are not the biggest decisions we face. But they can
  swallow up enormous amounts of time while leaving us restless and
  dissatisfied.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Becoming risk-savvy doesn’t have to be difficult or require a statistics
  degree. It involves using simple rules whenever possible and trusting your
  intuition. Ask the right questions and become more cognizant of the actual
  risks and uncertainties surrounding us every day. When confronted with a
  complex problem, ask yourself, “Is there a set of simple rules that can solve
  this complex problem?”

  there are things we can know, we must also be able to recognize when we cannot
  know something."

> "The quest for certainty is the biggest obstacle to becoming risk savvy. While there are things we can know, we must also be able to recognize when we cannot know something." _\- Risk Savvy, page 21_

Living with risk and uncertainty is a fact of life. We face threats and uncertainties when we drive to work, buy a stock for our retirement portfolio or take a new job in a different city.

Since there are no sure bets, reading Gerd Gigerenzer’s _Risk Savvy:_ _How to make Good Decisions_ is the next best thing to help us cope with everyday uncertainty. In this well-researched book, he shows that by asking the right questions, keeping a skeptical attitude and simplifying our decision-making process, we can improve the choices we make.

The author proclaims that becoming risk-savvy “requires courage to face an uncertain future as well as to stand up to authority and ask critical questions.” Achieving the savviness to improve our decisions entails knowing the distinction between risk and uncertainty.
