  ### Patience


  > "One fact is clear: things are not always as they seem."- Rules for a
  Knight, page 81


  The lesson of patience really stood out to me. It’s not just patience that
  resonated, it’s being able to let whatever happens to you play out over the
  course of time. Whether we come across success or failure, we don’t know the
  long-term impact that those fleeting events will have on the rest of our
  lives.


  To illustrate this point, Sir Thomas tells a simple, yet powerful, story where
  a series of good and bad events happen to him. As a result of those events,
  people in his community come up and either congratulate him or send him their
  apologies… each time his response is “we shall see”. We truly have no way of
  knowing how things will play out. He says, “Remember, it is possible that it
  is not the sun that goes down; perhaps it is the earth that turns. No one is
  really sure, but one fact is clear: things are not always as they seem” (page
  81).


  We can’t predict the future, good or bad, but learning to let go and let
  things play out can be extremely valuable throughout the course of our lives.

  ### Dedication


  > "Ordinary effort, ordinary result."- Rules for a Knight, Page 103


  Sir Thomas writes, “Everyone wants to be a knight; wanting is no great
  accomplishment. How hard you work is the difference between good and great,
  promising and masterful, squire and knight” (Page 104). This mindset is a
  simple reminder that hard work is a key ingredient to success. No matter what
  our job is, or what our goals are, the effort that we put into what we do is
  critical in achieving standout results.


  The most important component to this is being prepared and having a plan. Hard
  work alone is not enough to achieve lasting results. Ensuring that we have a
  laid out and designed a plan is critical before action. As the author writes,
  “Remember, Noah had to build the ark before the flood; likewise, you must not
  wait for the inevitable storms of life before you ready your mind. Thought
  precedes action” (page 105).

  ### Discipline


  > "In the field of battle, as in all things, you will perform as you practice,
  so practice hard. With practice, you build the road to accomplish your goals.
  Excellence lives in attention to detail."- Rules for a Knight, page 95


  A rule that was discussed throughout the letters, and is a staple of the
  simple principles that knights live by, is discipline. “Oddly, with
  discipline, structure, and order, you will find there is freedom” (page 96).
  This is a powerful insight, and at the surface might sound like a
  contradictory statement. When you dive deeper, it makes a lot of sense. The
  more disciplined we are in our planning, our preparation, and our
  routines/habits, the more flexible and adaptable we can be in the moment.
  Being disciplined is hard and often doesn’t produce the results that we need
  right away. In the long run though, it can really pay off. Think about
  exercise as an example: it takes discipline to get into shape, but once you
  have achieved a level of fitness, you have the freedom to accept invitations
  to challenging hikes, 5k runs, or other activities that require physical
  aptitude. Few people can think ahead enough to understand that discipline
  creates freedom down the road.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s amazing that so many of these principles of success haven’t changed over
  the last few hundred years. The twenty Rules for a Knight can very easily be
  applied and used as a guide for us to have success in business, leadership and
  our personal lives.

> “You are always in the right place at exactly the right time, and you always have been.” _\- Rules for a Knight, page 11_

Rules for a Knight was written by Ethan Hawke. Along with being a writer, Ethan Hawke is a four-time Academy Award nominee (twice for writing and twice for acting). You may have seen him in the following movies: _Dead Poets Society, Training Day, Reality Bites_ and _Gattaca_. Hawke has also authored several novels.

_Rules for a Knight_ takes the form of a parable, written as a letter, with lineage back to the 1400’s. The letter was “originally authored” by Sir Thomas Lemuel Hawke, before the Battle of Slaughter Bridge, where he and 323 others were killed. The letter was written to his children and was titled as Grandfather’s list of “Rules” to help them to learn life’s lessons, if he does not make it.

Those rules are: _Solitude, Humility, Gratitude, Pride, Cooperation, Friendship, Forgiveness, Honesty, Grace, Patience, Justice, Generosity, Discipline, Dedication, Speed, Faith, Equality, Love, Death._

Through the stories and lessons of this well-respected knight, these 20 rules provide us with a guide to live by. The list is as relevant today as it would have been a few hundred years ago. Through simple, powerful stories, these lessons can easily be applied to business and our personal lives.
