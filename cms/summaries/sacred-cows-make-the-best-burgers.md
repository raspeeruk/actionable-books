  ### The Beginner’s Advantage


  > "The key to keeping ahead in a changing environment is to think not like an
  expert, but like a beginner."- Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers, page 39


  Some of the biggest corporate revitalizations of the last 30 years have come
  when an individual from outside the industry steps into place at the head of
  the company. They get lauded with titles like “visionary”, “innovator” or
  “pioneer”. Don’t get me wrong, these are some exceptionally smart men and
  women. But they did have a distinct advantage. When we’re brought into
  something new, we come in with fresh eyes. Our ignorance to the way things
  “have always been done” is often the key to groundbreaking insight. Our
  tendency to want to understand everything can unearth buried logic and purpose
  (or lack thereof).


  Beginners ask questions based on a desire to learn and improve. Experts
  dictate answers based on past results. Here’s the fundamental problem – if
  you’re looking to change and grow, it means you’re moving into uncharted
  territory (after all, if it’s already been charted, then what’s the point?).
  When tackling challenges in an environment of change, past results and data
  won’t help you nearly as much as a genuine desire to create a better solution.
  While experts thrive in a static environment, it’s those who think like
  beginners that will lead the charge into the future.

  ### Trainee Practice


  > "In fact a perfect record is not always a sign of success, but one of
  failure. Doing it right every time may mean you aren’t trying anything new,
  challenging the status quo, or learning."- Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers,
  page 99


  No child walks on their first attempt. No concert pianist plays Flight of the
  Bumblebee perfectly the first time (or the second or third time) and no
  starting quarterback completes 100% of his passes. We make mistakes when we
  try new things. We make mistakes when we push ourselves, testing our limits
  and seeing if we’re capable of more. We make mistakes when we rush. I would
  say that two of these three reasons for error are completely acceptable. I’ll
  let you figure out which two.


  You’ve seen the trainee at the burger joint wearing the big “I’m in Training”
  button? There’s a reason they wear those, and it’s not some initiation-hazing
  ritual. Beginners make mistakes because they’re learning. We understand that,
  and our forgiveness levels are higher during that individual’s learning phase
  as a result. Few people argue with that logic. And yet the fact is that if we
  want to grow as individuals and as a company, we need to continue to learn and
  try new things. Some will work. Most will fail. At least initially. We need to
  accept “failure” as an integral part of success. Sure, there are most likely
  superiors in your organization who will hold you back from experimenting and
  failing (read = learning). You can try talking to them and explaining the
  logic behind new learning if you’d like. To start, though, I’d recommend
  looking inside. We’re often our own harshest critics when it comes to failure.
  Keep your standards high, but be sure to recognize that part of keeping those
  standards high is constantly learning and staying ahead of the curve. Be ok
  with the right kind of mistakes.


  When you look at it on paper – away from the deadlines, budgets and
  competition of the “real world” – the value of proactive change seems obvious.
  In business today, if you’re not innovating someone else is and you’re going
  to have to catch up eventually. Proactive change allows you to grow on your
  terms, building you and your team’s vision of what could be. And yet, we very
  often still hold back. Ultimately, the fear of the unknown, and the monsters
  that live in the shadows can stop us from pursuing growth and change. I want
  to leave you with an exercise from _Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers_ called
  “Reality Check”. It’s a simple one, and one that can have a lot of value.


  When you feel panic rising as you consider a new change, ask yourself these
  three important questions, and write down the answers.


  1.  What is most likely to happen?

  2.  What’s the worst thing that could happen if this situation doesn’t work
  out?

  3.  On a scale of one to ten – if ten equals certainty – what are the chances
  of your fears being realized?


  Then – and here’s the part where I see the most value – write out the
  following: “If \_\_\_ (worst case scenario )\_\_\_ were to happen, then \_\_
  (how you’d deal with it) \_\_\_\_.”


  How do you feel about that? Worth the risk? Intelligent change is how we grow.
  I encourage you to fill your life with intelligent change this year, and
  indefinitely into the future.

  ### Question Everything


  > "We aren’t trying to correct a problem, but to accelerate the growth of our
  biggest brand. We’re trying to make it harder for other companies to compete
  against us."- Brock Leach, VP Brand Marketing Pepsi Frito-Lay, quoted in
  Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers, page 55


  Here’s the thing – most people wait to create change until they’re absolutely
  forced to. This is the reactionary method we discussed in the opening
  paragraph. And, as we discussed, this is not a happy place to live.
  Reactionary change means you’re constantly playing catch up. While you’re
  working on getting “up to speed” on one area where you’ve been surpassed, the
  competition is pulling further ahead in another. It’s exhausting and it kills
  morale. So. Change forward.


  Take a time out from your frantic running around and spend a minute becoming
  aware. You don’t have to change anything… yet. Simply be conscious of the
  processes and systems you follow in your daily professional routine, noting
  how you do things, why you do things and try to think back to why you started
  doing this in the first place. Then,


  “QUESTION EVERYTHING.”


  Whether something’s working or not is irrelevant; question it anyway. Never be
  embarrassed to ask the dumb questions. “Dumb questions” are often the ones
  that lead to the biggest, fastest and easiest change, precisely because people
  have been too embarrassed to ask “why?” of things that seem “too obvious”.
  Question “obvious”. Question what works, and what doesn’t. Question
  everything.

CHANGE. For most of us, change in a work context means more – more work, more uncertainty, more mistakes, more anxiety and a more emotionally-charged work environment. And for good reason! Change brings about times of flux. Times when the future is uncertain, and the payoff unknown. But here’s the ultimate truth – change is one of two things: either reactive or proactive. Change is not an option. It hasn’t been in over 25 years. Change is the lifeblood of your business. To keep ahead of the competition – both as an individual and as a part of an organization – you must be changing; as quickly and as intelligently as you can. Competition is fierce like never before. For those who resist change – those who feel the anxiety and uncertainty of change weighing down on them – these are unhappy times. Business landscapes are changing at breakneck speeds, and show no signs of slowing down. In fact, the rate of change seems to be speeding up.

Here’s the good news. Change doesn’t have to be anxiety ridden. It doesn’t have to be more work, and while it will almost always be emotionally charged, what if change brought feelings of passion and excitement rather than fear and resistance?

In their landmark book, _Sacred Cows Make the Best Burgers_, bestselling authors Robert Kriegel and David Brandt explore the cause and effects of change in the workplace, and lay out beautifully – wittily and with major impact – how to develop change-ready people and organizations. Starting with you.
