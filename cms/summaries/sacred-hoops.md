  ### Basketball is a Metaphor for Life


  > "Like life, basketball is messy and unpredictable. It has its way with you
  no matter how hard you try and control it. The trick is to experience each
  moment with a clear mind and an open heart. When you do that, the game - and
  life - will take care of itself."- Sacred Hoops, page 19


  Jackson explains that faith and religion never resonated within him until he
  was introduced to Buddhism. Like many of us, Jackson expresses that in order
  for him \[humankind\] to fully place his belief in anything, he needs to both
  feel and relate to the virtues which define the governing belief being
  presented to him. He elaborates by explaining that not until he began regular
  meditation, which Zen Buddhism is based solely upon, was he able to find its
  tangibility, truth and divinity.


  He presents three lessons, which were passed on to him by Red Holzman, coach
  of the New York Knicks during Jackson’s freshman year as an NBA player. The
  following lessons are not fastidiously focused on Eastern philosophy yet
  provided Jackson with the ability to tie his newly found spiritual awareness
  to nearly any universal event.


  (1) Don’t let anger or heavy objects cloud the mind.  

  (2) Awareness is everything.  

  (3) The power of “We” is stronger than the power of “Me.”


  Jackson eloquently asks the audience to simply listen to him apply the tenets
  and theories of Buddhism to the tenets and theories of the practice of
  everyday life.

  ### Mindfulness


  > "I learned to trust the moment, to immerse myself as mindfully as possible,
  so I could start to react spontaneously to whatever was taking place."- Sacred
  Hoops, page 47


  Human beings are curious creatures by nature. With unbridled curiosity, there
  is commonly a great deal of mental energy expended for us to try to become
  something more than we are capable of being. Jackson maintains that the use of
  vigilant mindfulness and fully immersing ourselves into our actions, can allow
  us to control the outcome. Remaining realistic and humble are the simplest
  paths to success.


  Given the competition and push to always be a better version of who we are,
  this is a reminder to not focus on where we may never get but think about from
  where we came.


  Describing _Sacred Hoops_ as a book about basketball would be wildly
  inaccurate. What it is, however, is an account of one man’s ability to draw
  from what he is knowledgeable and passionate about and apply his knowledge
  through faith to any situation. It is a series of anecdotal and relevant ideas
  elemental not just to the foundation of the practice of Zen Buddhism, but to
  life. It is a blend of perfectly dosed amounts of faith, experience and
  results. Garnished, with a many rebounds and a few assists, Jackson delivers a
  slam dunk.


  I asked myself prior to reading Sacred Hoops if I would remain interested long
  enough to read it in its entirety. Given my underwhelming excitement for the
  sport of basketball, I was not sure.


  Retrospectively, as I close the back cover for the fifth time, I realize as I
  have upon finishing it in the past, that I remain more interested than ever
  before.

  ### The Invisible Leader


  > "After placing individuals in positions that fully realize their potential,
  a leader secures harmony among them by giving them all of the credit for their
  distinctive achievements."- Sacred Hoops, page 113


  Jackson explains that there are three approaches to managing, or in his case,
  coaching. He explains that the only way to become an honorable and unbiased
  leader is to identify the types of leaders each of us naturally are. He
  identifies the three styles of managers: as **Control-aholics**, who
  micro-manage everything from the players to their shadows (and what they are
  not doing , on and off the court.) Then he refers to **Laissez-Faire
  Leadership** (which, translated from French, means “hands off.”) Jackson also
  refers to this as , “non-leadership.” Jackson considers himself to be be a
  **“MiddleRoader.”** He characterizes this type of management as “perfect.” He
  attributes his ability to remain even-keel, to leave the game on the court and
  the drama at home, to his practice of Zen Buddhism. He characteristic of this
  type of management as perfectly, even-keel and attributes his ability to leave
  the game on the court and the drama at home, to his practice of Zen Buddhism.
  As “MiddleRoader,” he goes on to say that by making a regular and conscious
  effort to remain neutral and act without ego, man is best able to oversee and
  advise others.


  He goes on to use the analogy of the parts of a wheel to a master and his
  apprentices. Jackson presents two questions:


  (1) “Is it not the sturdiness of the spokes that determine the strength of a
  wheel?”  

  (2) “How is it that two wheels made of identical spokes differ in strength?”


  The answer, according to Jackson, is to see beyond what is seen. Never forget
  that a wheel is not only made up of spokes but also the space between the
  spokes. Sturdy spokes, poorly placed, make a weak wheel. Full potential can
  only be reached when harmony between the spokes is achieved and it is the job
  of the craftsman \[manager\] to create and balance those exact spaces.

> "Rookies are always ecstatic, seasoned players are quieter. Both on and off of the battlefield, winning is the only absolution." _\- Sacred Hoops, page 34_

From the first sentence of _Sacred Hoops_, Phil Jackson introduces the reader to his passionate and deliberate Zen-based approach to coaching as well as navigating his neophytes by directing them to act with a clear mind – not thinking, just doing; to respect the enemy and be aggressive without anger or violence; to live in the moment and stay calmly focused in the midst of chaos; to put the “me” in service of the “we.”
