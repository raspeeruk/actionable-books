  ### Stop Doing ‘Stuff’, Focus on Strategy


  > "Senior leaders know they have succeeded in building an organization that
  can scale – and is fun to run – when they are they are the dumbest people in
  the room"- Scaling Up, page 6


  Building a business requires top management to be focused on strategy not
  operations. As soon as this function is delegated, senior leaders can then
  concentrate on the strategic thinking and planning that is required to take
  their company to the top.


  This means that the senior team will be required to focus on their market,
  i.e. find out what really matters to your customers then find a way to deliver
  this value whilst differentiating yourself from the competition.


  Ongoing and never-ending market research will give the senior team the
  valuable data needed to guide decisions and be ready to capitalise on
  opportunities when they present themselves.

  ### Keep Your Eyes on Cashflow


  > "Constantly improving the cashflow of the company – and better understanding
  how cash moves through the business – is a powerful driver for improving the
  firm as a whole"- Scaling Up, page 199


  Get into the habit of having your available cash reported daily by the CFO,
  with a short explanation of why it changed in the last 24 hours, and chart it
  against accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) weekly. This helps
  to keep cash top of mind.


  There are three general categories where improvements can be made:


  1.  Shorten cycle times, i.e. get paid sooner.

  2.  Eliminate mistakes and make sure customers are satisfied with your product
  or service and are therefore happy to pay invoices on time.

  3.  Change the business model. For example, Dell structured their business
  model to collect full payments in advance before the production and delivery
  cycle, meaning the company ended up generating cash instead of consuming it.


  There are seven main ways you can improve cash and returns in your business:


  1.  Increase the price of your goods and services.

  2.  Sell more units at the same price.

  3.  Reduce the price you pay for raw materials and direct labour.

  4.  Reduce operating costs.

  5.  Collect from your debtors faster.

  6.  Reduce the amount of stock you have on hand.

  7.  Slow down the payment of creditors.

  ### Hire ‘A’ Players


  > "Scaling up a business requires both visionary leadership and great
  managers."- Scaling Up, page 74


  The main job of the head of the company is to make sure she has the right
  people doing the right things right. Jim Collins, in his book _How the Mighty
  Fall, And Why Some Companies Never Give In_ shares that executives with good
  companies tend to share their titles, whereas executives at strong and great
  companies share what their accountabilities are in a very measurable fashion,
  e.g. ‘I am accountable for driving revenue into this company’.


  Attracting and hiring A players at all levels of the organization is critical
  to the successful scaling up of a business. A Job Scorecard which details a
  person’s purpose for the job (i.e. the specific and measurable outcomes that a
  potential hire needs to accomplish) is the specific tool that will help you
  hire these A players.


  Once you’ve hired the A players, “periodic one-on-one coaching (rather than
  superior technical knowledge) ranks as the key to being a successful leader.”


  At the end of a training/coaching session, ask “What is the one takeaway that
  you are going to commit yourself to working on?”


  The five main activities of successful managers can therefore be summarised
  as:


  1.  Help people play to their strengths.

  2.  Don’t demotivate, rather “dehassle” i.e. remove energy drains (both people
  and processes).

  3.  Set clear expectations, and give employees a clear line of sight.

  4.  Give recognition, and show appreciation.

  5.  Hire fewer people, but pay them more.

  When Verne Harnish was asked what distinguishes the business leaders who make
  it to greatness, his answer was “Success belongs to those who have these two
  attributes; an insatiable desire to learn and an unquenchable bias for
  action”.

> "If you want to teach people a new way of thinking, don’t bother trying to teach them. Instead give them a tool, the use of which will lead to new ways of thinking." _\- R. Buckminster Fuller_

When starting a business, most entrepreneurs dream of the day when everything falls into place and the business really starts to take off. This is the point when all the blood, sweat and tears it takes to get a business off the ground start to make sense.

Having got to the top of this mountain, the next mountain now looms. You can either stay at this summit or choose a higher mountain, i.e. scale the business.

So how do you scale up without crashing and burning?

John Warrillow, founder of the Sellability Score and author of _The Automatic Customer_ says “_Scaling Up_ is a blueprint for building a growth company. With this book, Verne Harnish has pulled back the curtain on how the fastest-growing companies in the world fuel their growth. _Scaling Up_ gives you an insider’s view into the inner workings of the most successful companies on earth. A must-read for an ambitious entrepreneur”.
