  ### It’s All About Bandwidth


  > "It is easy to confuse a mind loaded by scarcity for one that is inherently
  less capable. We are emphatically not saying that poor people have less
  bandwidth. Quite the opposite. We are saying that all people, if they were
  poor, would have less effective bandwidth. "- Scarcity, page 65


  Our bandwidth is limited—and when too much of it is spent managing scarcity,
  our capacity is limited. When we are dealing with scarcity—of time or of
  money—we are distracted and our attentional resources are depleted. We
  “tunnel” on what is most immediately critical and have little ability to
  engage in what is not. This leads to things like over borrowing, failing to
  invest, and just generally not having as much intellectual capacity. This is
  what the authors call the bandwidth tax—and, in study after study, a
  significant drop in a variety of intelligence measures occurs when we are
  experiencing scarcity. One of the most fascinating and powerful studies is of
  Indian sugar cane farmers. Since they are paid at time of harvest, they
  experience both abundance and scarcity within any given year—because,
  invariably, money runs out towards the end of the year. Intelligence tests and
  tests of executive control demonstrate that the very same people test higher
  when living in abundance than when living in scarcity.


  In case you think this is only a problem of the third world, similar studies
  were done in the first world—putting people in situations that created
  scarcity and abundance—and the same results emerged.


  By understanding that scarcity itself creates the bandwidth tax, new
  possibilities for addressing scarcity emerge. Perhaps most importantly, we can
  see people differently and recognize that the behaviors of people (and
  organizations) living with scarcity are a result of reduced bandwidth—rather
  than being a result of what people are capable of.

  ### One-time Fixes


  > "Especially when you tunnel, it is much easier to do the right thing once
  than to have to repeat it… Whenever possible, convert vigilant behaviors into
  one-time actions. Rather than having to be vigilant every time you grab a
  snack from the pantry, just be vigilant \[in buying healthy foods\] at the
  grocery store."- Scarcity, page 212


  While this is not a book with easy remedies, here’s a wonderfully simple
  principle—with implications for individuals, organizations and societies. Make
  it harder to make bad choices and easier to make good ones by creating
  structures that embed the good and reduce the bad. For example, having an
  automatic savings plan means that you can “neglect” savings—it’s being done
  for you, in the background. Setting up automatic bill payments means that no
  matter how busy you get, you don’t forget to pay your bills. Spending time
  with your kids is easier when you sign up for an activity together and it’s on
  your calendar—than needing to plan it every week.


  And, alternately, make it harder to make bad one-time decisions. For example,
  a cooling off period for loans is a potential policy strategy to reduce the
  ease of making a bad decision.

  ### The Value of Slack


  > "To be free from a scarcity trip, it is not enough to have more resources
  than desires on average. It is as important to have enough slack (or some
  other mechanism) for handling the big shocks that may come one’s way at any
  moment."- Scarcity, page 137


  The authors provide several examples of studies of people who were dealing
  with financial or time scarcity and ended up in a situation of borrowing—and
  therefore debt. They were able to get out of the hole (in some studies, by
  having their debts paid off) and, within a short period of time—were right
  back where they started. In trying to understand this phenomenon, the authors,
  once again, don’t blame it on the individual’s nature—but on a structure that
  supports those of who live in abundance. In abundance, there is slack. In
  situations of scarcity, there is none. Without slack, scarcity will return
  because there is no back-up plan, no ability to absorb unexpected shocks.


  The takeaway here is that there are a variety of ways to structure situations
  to ensure more slack. This includes the rethinking of social programs, the way
  that loans are managed and a myriad of other small ideas that could have big
  impacts.


  And, for those of us not dealing with financial scarcity, and perhaps time
  scarcity, there are also ways to create more slack. A great organizational
  example that the authors gave was a hospital that never had enough beds for
  emergencies. By simply leaving one room unscheduled at all times—creating
  slack—they fixed the problem. Why did they need an external consultant to show
  them this simple—and even obvious—solution? Because they were “tunneling” on
  handling patients and unable to step out of the tunnel to see a bigger
  picture. Their organization’s cognitive capacity was diminished and the value
  of an outside perspective was even greater.
f_conclusion: >-
  Anyone who I’ve talked to in the last few weeks knew I was reading _Scarcity_.
  There are so many thought-provoking ideas and fascinating studies that I find
  myself unable to be in a conversation without at some point referring to the
  book. The fact that income inequality and poverty are very significant issues
  in our world is enough reason to read _Scarcity_—and the additional insights
  it offers for people and organizations are icing on the cake. And, it’s a
  great read.

  "Because the focus on scarcity is involuntary, and because it captures our
  attention, it impedes our ability to focus on other things. Scarcity in one
  walk of life means we have less attention, less mind, in the rest of life."

> "Because the focus on scarcity is involuntary, and because it captures our attention, it impedes our ability to focus on other things. Scarcity in one walk of life means we have less attention, less mind, in the rest of life." _\- Scarcity, page 41_

Having too little—money or time—can affect us in ways that are more profound than we might have imagined. In _Scarcity_, Sendhil Mullainathan, an economist, and Eldar Shafir, a psychologist, re-interpret existing studies and share the results of their own research, to show the impact of having less—of experiencing scarcity—on our minds and therefore on our lives. Perhaps their most powerful finding is that scarcity has a direct and powerful impact on intelligence and executive control. Where we tend to assume (consciously or unconsciously) that poverty is a result of personality, talent and intelligence—they demonstrate that intelligence, motivation and patience, among other attributes, are in fact deeply influenced by whether we are experiencing scarcity or abundance. The authors also demonstrate that a type of scarcity common to many of us who live in relative financial abundance—a perceived scarcity of time—has many of the same psychological impacts—which allows us greater empathy with those who are suffering from economic scarcity along with useful insights into how we can better live our lives.
