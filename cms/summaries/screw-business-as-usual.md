  ### It's all about the story


  > "The science behind global warming is solid - but it's the stories of
  ordinary people which engage your attention when you're half an ear to the
  radio and you're racing to pack your kids off to school. It's their stories
  that stick in your mind clearly enough that you can deliver them with
  confidence over a drink with a friend."- Screw Business As Usual, page 218


  Branson believes (as I do) that there’s a global shift occurring in the way we
  do business. His latest book is littered with examples of business leaders
  turning conventional capitalist wisdom on its head; companies and people that
  are doing good first, and making a tidy profit as a result.


  Possibly one of my favorite examples (buried in the back of the book under the
  cheeky title “I Rest My Case Studies”) is of Blake Mycoskie and his “Shoes for
  Tomorrow” project, more commonly known as TOMS shoes.


  Blake tells a good story. When you buy a pair of TOMS shoes, an identical pair
  is donated to a child in need. Their
  [website](http://www.toms.com/our-movement/) tells the story brilliantly. They
  use video, photos and testimonials. TOMS’ story is integrated into their
  marketing, but more than that, it’s firmly integrated into their business
  model. TOMS “one-for-one” model isn’t a marketing gimmick; it’s at the core of
  who they are and why they exist as a company.


  For me, TOMS is a quintessential success case of a 21st century business; what
  Branson refers to as a shining example of “Capitalism 24902”. They have a
  purpose larger than simply generating a profit, and they explain that purpose
  through story – story after story after story. Their shoes aren’t the
  cheapest, and they’re not the most well made. But they come with an important
  story – one that’s easy to share, and easy to feel good about.

  ### Stop Hiding


  > "You know the expression, ‘It’s not personal; it’s business’? We sneer at
  such rot. All business is personal, all the time."- Chris Kilham, quoted in
  Screw Business As Usual, page 237


  Who are you working for? What change are you and your company trying to make
  in this world? I don’t care what industry you work in, or how big your company
  is (Chris Kilham, quoted above, works in pharmaceuticals). Consumers,
  investors and the public at large are starting to put their support (and
  dollars) behind those companies that are working to make a positive change in
  the world.


  People buy from Virgin because (a) Virgin makes them feel special (a big
  change unto itself) and (b), Branson (and Virgin by extension) is dedicated to
  using its corporate strength to do good. (If you want truly amazing examples
  of this, check out [The Elders](http://www.theelders.org/), [Virgin
  Unite](http://www.virginunite.com/), [The Carbon War
  Room](http://www.carbonwarroom.com/) and [Branson Centre for
  Entrepreneurship](http://www.bransoncentre.org/SouthAfrica/home.html).)


  As a company, Virgin has purpose. Branson owns businesses (The Virgin Group
  consists of 400+ companies at this time), each business working to contribute
  to the betterment of society and our planet, either directly through their
  core business, or through the charitable and passion projects lead by their
  employees. And they’re better for it – both from a sense of accomplishment
  **and** from a bottom line profitability stand point.


  Stop hiding behind the line “this is business, not a charity”, and start
  looking for ways to improve the world around you _through_ your business, or
  by utilizing the professional strengths you’ve developed.

  ### Stories can't be boring


  > "For those who think business exists to make a profit, I suggest they think
  again. Business makes a profit to exist. Surely it must exist for some higher,
  nobler purpose than that."- Ray Anderson, founder of Interface Inc., quoted in
  Screw Business As Usual, page 99


  If you’ve ever sat (or likely stood) through a dry, never ending story that
  never seems to end (often at a cocktail party, for some reason), you know what
  I mean when I say a story can’t be impactful **and** boring. They simply can’t
  co-exist. Good stories engage our hearts and minds. A well told story captures
  the imagination. It allows us to **feel** something, and to imagine the world
  as a better place.


  How many times have you asked what someone “does”, and immediately felt your
  eyes glazing over as you realize the answer is dry, dull and typical? How many
  times have you been the one **telling** the boring story?


  I would like to suggest that you have the power to tell an engaging, inspiring
  story when you talk about what you do. I say this with confidence because I
  believe two things to be true: (1) either your company is doing something
  powerful to change the world, and that story is interesting, and (2) if your
  company is honestly not doing anything interesting, you have the power to
  change that, if only in some small way. I humbly suggest that (particularly at
  cocktail parties) people most don’t actually care what you **do** in your
  professional pursuits, but that almost everyone is interested in **the change
  you are making in the world.**


  To have an interesting story, you need to be involved in something
  interesting. Making the world a better place is always an interesting story.
  Think about how you’re impacting your world (in a big or small way), and start
  telling **that** story. You’ll be more interesting, I promise you.
f_conclusion: >-
  I really do love reading Branson’s books. His passion for life, his “nothing
  is impossible” attitude, and his great willingness to share the stories of
  others is engrained in every page. All of his books are inspiring and
  entertaining but, while I’ve enjoyed them all, _Screw Business As Usual_ is
  something all together different. This is a call to action. It’s **a starting
  point.** Yes, the book is a great source of inspiration and enthusiasm, but
  Branson’s top priority is to give you the tools and the insight to **start
  something**; to make a positive difference in the world, regardless of whether
  that difference is big or small.

Serial entrepreneur, Sir Richard Branson (founder of all things ‘Virgin’ branded), knows a thing or two about telling stories. His first business venture, _Student_ (a magazine, which he launched at age 17), was about collecting and sharing stories. His four books are loaded with stories of people exemplifying his messages. Perhaps it was his dyslexia that first put him down the path of collecting stories (versus facts). Perhaps he’s always just had a knack for engaging hearts and minds through story. Whatever the impetus, one of Branson’s many gifts is his ability to tell a good tale.

His latest work, _Screw Business As Usual_ is no exception. The message is simple – “that every single business person has the responsibility for taking care of the people and planet that make up our global village, all 24,902 circumferential miles of it” (page 19). Branson expounds that message through story after story after story – of people, companies and organizations that are living and breathing it every day.

I believe that, in addition to being an entertaining read, this book (and the included resources at [www.virginunite.com/screwbusinessasusual](www.virginunite.com/screwbusinessasusual)) exists so that we can all take that first step to _screw business as usual_ and, in doing so, start to make this world of ours a better place; for us, and for generations to come.
