  ### The power of the profit motive


  > "When you recognize the power of the profit motive, you take your first
  major step towards financial success. It’s the point of entry to higher
  earnings, the first strategy for becoming a six-figure woman. Indeed, not one
  of us will achieve financial success unless we make up our minds that’s what
  we want."- Secrets of Six-Figure Women, page 88


  There comes a time in each potential six-figure woman’s life when she realizes
  that to get to where she wants to be, she first needs to make a commitment to
  herself to earn more. After this declaration has been made, it shifts her
  mindset and opens her up to the possibility of earning more.


  These women realized that in order to achieve their dreams, they would need
  the dollars to turn them into a reality.


  The key difference between the underearners and the six-figure women was that
  underearners did not have a profit motive. This would result in them working
  hard but not channelling their energy and focus towards a broader vision. The
  six-figure women had a clear focus and this ensured they were consciously
  making day-to-day decisions and taking deliberate actions, which honoured
  themselves.


  When you keep your promise to yourself it builds your self-esteem and
  increases your chances for success. When you have intention, you attract
  success, becoming a magnet that draws you to the next step of your journey,
  whatever that may be.

  ### Get in the game


  > "When your intentions are deep and compelling, and your commitment strong
  and inflexible you’re more likely to keep going when the going gets rough."-
  Secrets of Six-Figure Women, page 91


  After you have a profit motive and declare your intent, the next step is to
  get in the game. Through Stanny’s interviews with the six-figure women she
  uncovers the rules of the game they play by:


  1.  Decide which game to play

  2.  Jump in, ready or not

  3.  Keep on truckin’

  4.  Grab opportunities

  5.  No excuses allowed

  6.  Ignore naysayers

  7.  Never personalize


  First and foremost, you need to decide which game you are playing. Stanny
  quotes Larry Wilson who says there are two games in life: Not To Lose or To
  Win. Not To Lose is the game people play when they say they want success but
  they don’t want to leave their comfort zone. If you want to take ownership of
  your future then you have to play To Win. This means going as far as you can
  with what you’ve got. This doesn’t mean you will always “win”, however you
  come out a winner because you push yourself and are ‘all in’ and nothing
  stands in your way.


  When you are playing by these rules there is no room for excuses. These women
  seized every opportunity they saw, even if they didn’t know how to do
  something or weren’t qualified. They didn’t make excuses; rather they said yes
  and figured it out later. Self-belief and self-esteem are the essential
  ingredients to further your growth and development.


  In this game you will always be faced with naysayers. They will be there to
  bring you down. How you deal with them is your choice. Choosing to view them
  as challenges that test you to see how bad you want to succeed and how
  committed you are is a sure-fire way to turn them into fuel to achieve your
  dreams.


  When you play by these rules, you thrive.

  ### Feel the fear and let go of the ledge


  > "You must let go of where you are to get to where you want to go. Clinging
  to the security of the familiar prevents us from discovering what awaits us in
  the future. The ledges in our lives offer the illusion of safety, but in truth
  their only value is to keep us hanging, their only reward is burnout, boredom,
  financial lack or personal frustration."- Secrets of Six-Figure Women, page
  108


  All the women who were interviewed in this book had something they had to let
  go of and when they did they were met with synchronicities of “lucky” events.
  This turning point was necessary because it created the space for their
  desires to manifest.


  The “letting go” process is one you need to master as it never ends. The more
  success you achieve, the more you need to believe in yourself and continue
  letting go; this is what pushes your forward.


  Before you can fully move into six-figure territory, you first must figure out
  what’s holding you back. There is a great deal of “inner work” which needs to
  be done to reach your earning potential. Becoming aware of your mindset,
  limiting beliefs or the script in your head that keeps you stagnant is
  essential. By exploring what these are, facing them head on and committing to
  change, you are able to take charge of your life.

  "When you commit to a goal without knowing exactly how you’ll achieve it, you
  automatically trigger a tremendous power. When your intention is strong and
  your commitment is staunch, the how-tos invariably show up. I saw over and
  over how once the women I was talking to set their sights on higher earnings,
  lo and behold, that’s what they got."

Barbara Stanny interviewed over 150 women in a pursuit to learn and reveal the secrets of six-figure women. Through her interviews, Stanny collected the stories of women whose annual earnings range from $100,000 to $7 million.

She also researched the flip side of the coin, underearners. Through insight into the minds, thoughts and decision patterns of underearners she was able to gain a holistic understanding when it comes to women, money and mindset. The six-figure women showcased in this book come from all different walks of life, industries and have all had different upbringings, coming from both loving and abusive environments.

Through Stanny’s extensive research and insight she discovered that the women she was interviewing weren’t driven by money alone. They all had hopes and dreams which inspired them to earn more and create a better life for themselves. Money symbolised something different to each one of these women. The common thread between them? “Focus on fulfilling your values rather than financial gain.” These women had a vision for their life based on cherished values such as challenge, independence, recognition and security.
