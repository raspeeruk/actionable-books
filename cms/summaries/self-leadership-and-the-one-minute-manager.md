  ### You are more powerful than you think


  > "Don’t buy into the assumed constraint that position power is the only power
  that works."- Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager, page 50


  Believing you have the power to lead yourself is the first step to taking
  responsibility. The authors do a great job of illustrating multiple varieties
  of power that a person has at his/her disposal. I found this very liberating
  and at the heart of self leadership.


  As the quote above suggests, **position power** is the most obvious kind of
  power. “The Boss” has position power. But, that is not the only kind. They
  also list:


  *   **Task power**, the ability to do something other people can’t.

  *   **Personal power**, the ability to assure people and gain their
  confidence.

  *   **Knowledge power**, being the person who knows things that others don’t.

  *   **Relationship power**, it’s not what you know, but who you know.


  Regardless of position, tenure or experience, each person has at least one of
  those kinds of power they can activate to lead themselves and to get their
  work done. If you listen to most people’s excuses, they refuse responsibility
  because they fail to acknowledge they have power.


  My daughters were 11 and 14 when they returned from summer camp determined to
  “feed the homeless.” They couldn’t drive. They had no money. They had no
  street-smarts. But they had determination. They asked for my help. They called
  rescue missions. We contrived a way to get drivers to carry meals in their car
  to hand out to panhandlers on street corners. Their story was included in a
  book entitled, _Do Hard Things_, and people from all over the country wanted
  to be part of the action. Literally thousands of meals have been given to
  homeless men and women because two young girls recognized they had more power
  than they knew.

  ### You are responsible for getting what you need


  > "When goals work out, it is usually because you instinctively take the
  initiative to be a self leader and get what you need to succeed."- Self
  Leadership and the One Minute Manager, page 104


  The importance of self leadership is clearly set forth in the book. The
  authors deviate a little from the simplicity of their call to self leadership
  when they add “situational leadership” into the mix. It feels a little
  off-topic, yet the addition does add substance.


  You don’t always need the same thing, depending on your competence and
  commitment. If you have low competence, you clearly need more direction than
  you do if you are highly competent. But, you could be highly competent and
  still need support to help you complete a project.


  _The One Minute Manager_ franchise has other situational leadership books. The
  concept is, though, most helpful when you apply it to yourself. If you take
  responsibility for your own performance, you know – really know – how
  competent you are or how committed you are. So you can get the help you need.
  You’ll never be as sure of another person’s situation quite as well as your
  own.

  ### Challenge assumed restraints


  > "Circus trainers say they can put a piece of string around that six-ton
  elephant’s leg and he won’t break away."- Self Leadership and the One Minute
  Manager, page 31


  The book retells the well-worn story about training a circus elephant with a
  cable when it is small and later the giant full-grown elephant will remain
  tethered by a small string because the elephant thinks it is still cabled. I
  don’t know if it is true or fiction, but it doesn’t really matter. We can
  readily see that they only reason such a powerful animal would refuse to move
  is its belief that it can’t.


  Most of the failure of self leadership is the belief that we can’t. We put
  restraints on ourselves. If you think of a frustrating situation and complete
  the sentence, “I can’t because…”, you will find your constraints. If you take
  a close look at those constraints, some are real, and will have to be overcome
  by real means. Many of them are assumed restraints. I assume I can’t, so I
  don’t try. Much of self leadership is deciding to challenge those assumptions.


  The simplest way to challenge assumed restraints is to ask for help. Asking
  for help is like magic, the authors claim. Everyone loves to feel useful and
  important. If you ask for help, you will be surprised at what you will
  receive.
f_conclusion: >-
  By creating a parable involving a magician, the authors made this an easy
  read. The friend who turned me on to this book has assigned it to a leadership
  class of high school students. I have assigned this to a leadership class I
  teach at our church. It is not a Christian book, yet the simple message of
  taking responsibility for yourself is foundational to all moral living.

> "I want people who are problem solvers and are willing to take initiative. I want people working for me who act like they own the place." _\- Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager, page v_

A friend handed me _Self Leadership and the One Minute Manager_ a couple years ago and told me it had made a huge difference in his career. My friend was a highly effective regional manager for a national company and he had maintained several successful personal businesses on the side. If it made such a difference for him, I was interested.

I started reading it. And it was dumb! It is a parable about a disillusioned account executive who meets an off-beat magician. She talks him through his problems until they “magically” (pun intended) disappear. As I read along, my attitude switched from this is dumb to this is brilliant. The simplicity of the parable matched the simplicity of the concept of self leadership and provided a worthy vehicle to communicate it to the reader. Yet, the simplicity masked how profound and life-changing self leadership can be!

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### You are more powerful than you think

The message that you can make a difference in your own life is the simplest leadership messages, and is desperately needed in our generation.
