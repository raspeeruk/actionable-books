  ### Trust Thyself


  > "Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string."- Self-Reliance,
  page 4


  “Trust thyself.”


  Sounds so simple doesn’t it? Then why is it so hard?  

  What Emerson wrote over 170 years ago is as true today as it was when he wrote
  it.


  We live in a world where we are influenced by so many different factors.
  Whether it’s our education, upbringing, media, religion, politics, etc. – we
  are constantly presented with not only more information, but also more
  _opinions_.


  And while there is nothing “wrong” with any of the above, we must be careful
  to not let all of the “outside noise”, drown out our _own_ voice.


  To not let it drown out what we truly and genuinely believe, and see in our
  own hearts.  

  To not let it break our “iron string”.


  “Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say ‘I
  think,’ ‘I am’, but quotes some saint or sage,” writers Emerson. “He is
  ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my
  window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what
  they are; they exist with God today. There is no time to them. There is simply
  the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.”


  We must trust ourselves.  

  And in order to trust ourselves, we must Know Ourselves, and Be Ourselves.

  ### Be Yourself


  > "We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which
  each of us represents."- Self-Reliance, page 3


  **If you know yourself, then why not just be yourself?**


  Emerson urges us to recognize that we are all unique, with our own strengths
  and weakness. Our own wants and desires, our own beliefs and values.


  And that’s OK.


  “Insist on yourself; never imitate,” writes Emerson. “Your own gift you can
  present every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life’s cultivation;
  but of the adopted talent of another, you have only an extemporaneous, half
  possession. That which each can do best, none but his Maker can teach him. No
  man yet knows what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is
  the master who could have taught Shakespeare? … Every great man is a unique…
  Shakespeare will never be made by the study of Shakespeare.”


  I know you’ve probably heard this before. But it’s worth mentioning here
  again. The world doesn’t need more “me toos”. What the world needs, is You.
  And Emerson’s _Self-Reliance_ is a perfect reminder, and manifesto, for that.
  It’s true what the book description says, “Every page of this manifesto will
  cut you to the bone, inspire you and expose the seduction of blind obedience
  for what it is: a trap.” And I know I’ll be keeping it close by.


  “Nothing is as last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.”

  ### Know Yourself


  > "We live in the lap of immense intelligence, which makes us receivers of its
  truth and organs of its activity."- Self-Reliance, page 24


  In a society that is eager to tell us, and present us with ideas on what “we
  should do” or “should be”, Emerson urges us to become more self-aware and
  understand who we truly are.


  What do you believe in? Why?  

  What do you want to do? Why?  

  What are you currently doing? Why?


  It’s crucial to understand the internal compass, which we all have.


  Emerson believed it was pointless to even donate to seemingly “good causes” or
  strive for the betterment of society, without understanding why you’re doing
  so in the first place. “All men plume themselves on the improvement of
  society, and no man improves.”


  Here are two ways you can get to know yourself better:


  **1) Keep A Journal:** Every evening before going to sleep, reflect on your
  day and how you felt it went. Some questions you could ask: Did I accomplish
  my goals for the day? How did it feel? What went well? What needs work?
  Similarly, write every morning as well. You could use this time to write your
  goals for the day, or acknowledge the things you’re thankful for. As you write
  more and more, day by day, patterns will emerge, and you’ll begin to get a
  clearer sense of not only the direction you’re headed, but also the how and
  why as well. This practice has really helped me become much more self-aware.


  **2) Do Something:** Of course, sitting on the sidelines, not doing anything
  won’t do any good either. In order to know yourself, you must also go out and
  experience the world. Go do something. And then (and this is key) reflect on
  the experience. Write about it in your journal. “Your genuine action will
  explain itself, and will explain your other genuine actions. Your conformity
  explains nothing.”

> "Nothing can bring you peace but yourself. Nothing can bring you peace but the triumph of principles." _\- Self-Reliance, page 73_

I have a question for you:

Are you _truly_, living your most authentic life?  
Are you _truly_, marching to the beat of your own drum?  
To the _beat_, of _your own_ heart?

This is the question at the heart of one of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s most famous, and inspiring, literary works: _Self-Reliance_.

Emerson challenges us to look ourselves in the mirror (the mirror within) and honestly – brutally honestly – challenge whether or not we are living a life that is true to ourselves.

Whether our values are aligned with what we’re doing.  
Whether we’re being true to our hearts.

And if we’re not, it’s an immediate call to action.  
A call to trust the person we should be trusting in every single moment.

We should, “Trust thyself.”

“Trust thyself.”

Sounds so simple doesn’t it? Then why is it so hard?  
What Emerson wrote over 170 years ago is as true today as it was when he wrote it.

We live in a world where we are influenced by so many different factors. Whether it’s our education, upbringing, media, religion, politics, etc. – we are constantly presented with not only more information, but also more _opinions_.

And while there is nothing “wrong” with any of the above, we must be careful to not let all of the “outside noise”, drown out our _own_ voice.

To not let it drown out what we truly and genuinely believe, and see in our own hearts.  
To not let it break our “iron string”.

“Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say ‘I think,’ ‘I am’, but quotes some saint or sage,” writers Emerson. “He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God today. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence.”

We must trust ourselves.  
And in order to trust ourselves, we must Know Ourselves, and Be Ourselves.
