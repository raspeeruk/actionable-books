  ### Sell the Relationship


  > "Clients are experts in knowing if they feel valued. In most professional
  services, you are not really selling expertise – because your expertise is
  assumed, and your prospect cannot intelligently evaluate your expertise
  anyway. Instead, you are selling a relationship. And in most cases, that is
  where you need the most work."- Selling the Invisible, page 42


  Beckwith uses an example of how the failure of a business is similar to the
  failure of a marriage. People stop communicating. Asking is the first and most
  essential step. Ask first, “who is the customer” so you can identify your
  focus. Then ask them what their needs are. Only then are you are qualified to
  show them you can meet those needs. Follow-up by asking for candid feedback,
  preferably have a third party surveyor ask. Continuously re-evaluate by
  repeating the process and make necessary accommodations or changes. When the
  act of repeating the process does not happen, this is the inflection point;
  the relationship ends and the service provider asks why. It is because the
  work to maintain the relationship was not done, and the client considered
  other prospects. Our clients are inundated with possibilities now more than
  ever before. Focusing on maintaining that connection is paramount.

  ### Communicate Clearly


  > "Sometimes, it’s all in how you say it."- Selling the Invisible, page 193


  Beckwith uses examples of how a salesperson can complicate the sale by giving
  the customer too many options. A salesperson who shows a customer three shirts
  instead of the exact shirt he asked for or makes the customer question the
  value of an extended warranty and offers a variety of financing options often
  loses the sale. This is called the hard buy because the customer is confused
  and cannot intelligently choose. He contrasts this to an easy buy where the
  salesperson identifies the customer’s needs makes the offer and the price
  clear and builds trust by reducing the customer’s risk. He may even offer the
  customer the ability to sample the service or product first, eliminating the
  requirement of an unearned long-term commitment. People buy when it is easy.


  Using metaphors and simple stories to explain your service is another
  effective tool that Beckwith uses throughout the book. People believe the
  things they understand, and it is about their beliefs. If you want them to
  believe in you, give them stories they can relate to. Focus on simplicity; it
  is better to say too little than too much. The more you say, the harder the
  service or product is to buy. It becomes unappealing because it is too complex
  to understand. If it is hard to understand, it means it is hard to buy.


  In addition to making your offer clear and easy for the customer, Beckwith
  talks about selling who you are. He says life is like high school, it is a
  popularity contest. It is about chemistry between you and your clients. He
  says when surveyors ask why clients are loyal to a company they usually answer
  that it is because they “just feel comfortable” with them. Do your clients
  feel comfortable with you? If not is it because of the chemistry in the
  relationship?

  ### Understand the Person


  > "Before you try to satisfy ‘the client,’ understand and satisfy the person"-
  Selling the Invisible, page 43


  Beckwith includes examples of pitches that fail because the salesperson talks
  about themselves and their service or product and not about the client. I
  recently answered the phone and it was a telemarketer selling a natural gas
  service. His pitch included much information that he had practiced, and he
  delivered it well. When he let me speak, I explained I do not have natural
  gas, only electric. He did not ask what I needed. He wasted time for both of
  us. People think about themselves, not about you, and you do it too. It takes
  practice to learn to think about them and not about you. When you talk about
  them, you learn what their needs are. Try this today: only talk to people
  about them. Do not talk about yourself at all. Think about them, who they are
  and what they want. Ask what you can do for them. How does that change your
  relationship? Now think about how much better your business relationships
  could be if you put this into practice every day.
f_conclusion: >-
  I enjoyed this book. It has a plethora of great advice, and I have only
  touched on it here. I focused on the relationship aspects of marketing
  services and products because this is the biggest problem I am encountering
  now. Although no one questions that I do my job well, I found myself in a
  situation where the chemistry in a client relationship was wrong from the
  beginning. In spite of the effort I put into doing a great job, the
  relationship failed, and I had to endure the consequences. When I asked myself
  what went wrong, the one thing that stood out was that communication broke
  down on all levels, and that happens when people do not feel comfortable with
  each other. Even if there are no apparent conflicts, without good
  communication people do not share understanding. They make assumptions and
  problems develop; the relationship will always fail. I can see the same
  pattern in the stories people tell me about their lives. As Beckwith points
  out, recognizing the patterns gives you the advantage that helps you make the
  best decisions. A building consists of thousands of tiny bricks that all fit
  together, just like your organization. A few of them out of place begin to
  cause cracks in the structure and eventually the building will fall. Fixing
  the little things while you can prevents big losses later.

  "Services are human. Their successes depend on the relationships of people.
  People are human – frustrating, unpredictable, temperamental, often
  irrational, and occasionally half mad. But you can spot some patterns in
  people. The more you can see the patterns and better understand people, the
  more you will succeed – and this book was written with the hope that it will
  help you do just that."

_Selling the Invisible_ is a collection of little examples and metaphors Harry Beckwith uses that show the most and least effective ways to market and sell services. The stories have a central theme; success is about creating a strategy, a foundation based on measuring and evaluating the needs of the customer and adapting accordingly. Implementing tactics are the structure; they are about creating and maintaining relationships based on chemistry, popularity, and the client’s beliefs. Understanding people by identifying patterns and nurturing relationships is how real success happens.
