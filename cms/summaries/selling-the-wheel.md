  ### There is no Perfect Salesperson


  > "For one thing, we learned that there is no such thing as the perfect
  salesperson who is universally effective with all customers."- Selling the
  Wheel, page 9


  Cox clearly illustrates through his story that different types of salespeople
  or sales systems are more impactful than others at various points throughout
  the life of a company. There simply is not one-type of perfect salesperson.


  For example, in the early years of a company’s life, it’s crucial to have
  someone who is able to close one-time deals with as many early adopters as
  possible. This salesperson sells not only a product or service, but also sells
  the opportunity associated with the product. As this salesperson is one that
  will do anything to seal the deal, he often neglects the other aspects of
  relationship management, such as client support or service.


  However, as a company begins growing and taking on larger clients, the ideal
  salesperson’s role starts changing: instead of getting clients simply to sign
  the dotted line, the role is more about building a system that helps instruct
  the early majority of users on how to use the product. The system also offers
  support for any damages to the product.


  Later on, when the majority of clients have started using the technology (in
  the case of our story, the wheel), the salesperson’s role once again evolves:
  instead of instructing or converting non-users into users, it is now about
  maintaining relationships with everyone, client or not. Most people have now
  tried this technology. In order to acquire customers, a good salesperson waits
  patiently for their prospect’s current business partner to mess up, either
  through neglect or poor service. Once this happens, the salesperson then
  intervenes and attempts to win the client.


  As the company and the competition begin to saturate the market, one
  salesperson is no longer enough to capture the entire market. Instead, our
  original salesperson is now leading a sales team that simply try to remove
  barriers for clients to buy their product, and outdo the competition by adding
  more value per client.


  As we can see through the various iterations of company growth outlined above,
  the most appropriate salesperson, sales style, and set of priorities can vary
  dramatically. While you may have always thought that “sales” wasn’t your
  strong point, it’s worth considering that you may just need to switch the type
  of sales that you’re exploring. If you’ve hit a plateau in your sales, it
  could be because your style and focus isn’t aligned with your company’s
  (current) needs. Try moving to an earlier or later stage of the process.

  ### The Power of Focus


  > "Would you try and harness the falcon to the chariot? ... By the same token,
  would you try to train the horse to fly?"- Selling the Wheel, page 228


  As Ozzie the Oracle explains to the protagonists, these four types of
  salespeople (outlined above) are like different animals, each one driving your
  business with their own methods. While each animal is capable of certain
  methods of travel, harnessing all of them to one vehicle is not a good idea.


  Each one has its own ability, and it’s up to you to figure out which type of
  salesperson you need for your organization. Similarly, if you’re looking to
  improve your sales, perhaps you’re targeting the wrong market or types of
  sales opportunities.


  Failing to focus, and trying to use all four types of salespeople for your
  organization (particularly with uniform training and incentive programs),
  spells out almost-certain doom for your business. Focus (at most) on a primary
  market and a secondary market, and find the two types of salespeople that
  correspond best to each one.

  ### Ozzie the Oracle


  > "For the price of a burnt offering, you could ask any question and the
  Oracle would tune in to the infinite and tell you what was what."- Selling the
  Wheel, page 21


  Throughout the plot of _Selling the Wheel_, whenever the entrepreneurial
  protagonist was stuck at an intersection, or faced with an overwhelming
  competitor, he and his business partner would pay “Ozzie the Oracle” a visit.
  It was here that they received pivotal strategic advice that would change
  their company and their approach to sales.


  While the notion of an all-knowing and all-foreseeing mentor is just as
  nonexistent as the perfect salesperson, the real-life Ozzie the Oracle could
  be a board of advisors, mentors, or directors. Where will you turn to when you
  have no idea what to do? Who’s got your back?
f_conclusion: >-
  _Selling the Wheel_ is an excellent resource for those just getting into
  sales, and can also be an interesting exploration for those looking to take
  their sales skills to the next level. Cox manages to transform what could have
  been an extremely dry topic into a remarkable story that’s easy to follow (and
  introduces some hilarious historic equivalents to the modern world). If this
  summary even remotely piques your curiosity, you need to give _Selling the
  Wheel_ a read.

Have sales roles always been a mystery to you? Or alternatively, do you find yourself sitting on a plateau in your own sales performance?

In _Selling the Wheel_, author Jeff Cox and Howard Stevens tell the story of a “technology startup” – a fictional company inventing and marketing _the wheel_ – evolving into a large corporation. Through his humorous and inspired story, Cox gives readers a look into the entire ecosystem and lifecycle of a business, focusing his attention on which elements are integral to specific sales processes.
