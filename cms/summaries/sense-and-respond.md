  ### Create a Culture of Continuous Learning


  > "If you ask people to build features, they will, and they will value the
  delivery of those features, even if delivery doesn’t create big picture
  success. They will value the traits and behaviors that make it possible to
  deliver features. On the other hand, if you ask people to be responsible for
  success, you are asking them to work in a new way."- Sense and Respond, page
  194


  The command and control culture of the industrial age rewards sticking to the
  plan, even if you learn that the plan no longer makes sense. This is called
  the _delivery culture_.


  A delivery culture that values hitting your production deadline targets is in
  direct conflict with a culture that prizes discovering and embracing emergent
  customer values. In a delivery culture, there is no time for conversations
  with the market and no time for learning and iterations.


  Instead of a top-down, order-taking culture, sense and respond methods push
  decision making out into the organization, allowing the people who are the
  closest to the customer, to the markets, and to the situation at hand to make
  the decisions. It values what these people know, and, even more, it values
  their ability to learn.


  There are seven important elements that make up this learning culture:


  1.  **Humility** — Being aware that we don’t have all the information we’d
  like to have.

  2.  **Permission to fail** — Experimenting means we can be wrong. And that’s
  OK.

  3.  **Self-direction** — Empowering people and allowing them to push towards
  the direction they want to pursue without waiting for permission.

  4.  **Transparency** _—_ Sharing all new information, good or bad.

  5.  **A bias toward action** — Preferring action to analysis. Learning comes
  from action.

  6.  **Empathy** _—_ Putting ourselves in our customer’s’ shoes and trying to
  understand their worldview.

  7.  **Collaboration** _—_ Together is better.


  Embracing change means embracing culture change, and how to change culture is
  not an easy question.


  Considering that culture is what we do, we can promote culture change by
  encouraging people to do new things, creating new perceptions and new points
  of view.


  Leadership is essential when we want to get people doing new things, it’s the
  reason why culture change must be led. Leaders have to make culture everyone’s
  priority through top-down and bottom-up culture change initiatives. This is
  the way the sense and respond approach can be used to implement a sense and
  respond culture. Culture is in effect a product of your organization’s ongoing
  conversations with itself about itself.

  ### It’s About People, Not Technology


  > "So the final piece of the puzzle isn’t really about technology. It’s about
  people, specifically the people in your organization. Are you set up in a way
  that allows you to respond? Can your speed of response match your speed of
  insight? We’re not talking about how fast you can make things, but rather how
  fast you can decide to make things."- Sense and Respond, page 102


  The limiting factor is now operational. Changing the speed with which we can
  respond to new insight is all about decision making. Trusting people and using
  the individuals best positioned to make real-time decisions are the key
  principles here.


  The most common way to organize teams so that they can respond quickly is to
  use agile methods that promote team-level empowerment and decision making
  based on data. This will hand over control of the tactical decisions to the
  teams that are closest to the insight and value learning by moving from
  question to question. The teams will be able to learn and pivot without having
  to stick to a predefined plan.


  In order to generate such a behavior, the team should be allowed to make
  mistakes—as long as they are relatively small and the team can learn from
  them. The team should also be provided freedom, within clearly stated
  constraints, to make their own decisions_—_so time will not be wasted waiting
  for executive feedback. And last but not least,, value has to be placed on
  customer behavior as a measure of progress—not on the number of features the
  team will be shipping.


  A sense and respond organization has to trust and empower its employees if it
  wants to exploit the insights collected using the technology.

  ### The New Definition of “Done”


  > "So making a thing, creating an output of some sort, is not our goal.
  Instead, success is the extent to which we achieve an outcome and help our
  customers achieve an outcome they seek."- Sense and Respond, page 50


  In the industrial-age mindset, success was the launch of a product, especially
  if it was on time and on budget, because at that time the connection between a
  product and its use were usually pretty clear. In traditional and
  well-understood product categories you could be reasonably certain that if you
  could make something that worked, met demand, and was priced correctly, you
  would be successful.


  As our products have gotten more complex and as customer’s expectations have
  risen, our level of uncertainty about our services has also grown. Simply
  making a thing is no longer good enough, because the link between purpose and
  actual use is less clear.


  Amazon’s 2014 Fire Phone can perfectly highlight the point. They created the
  Fire Phone initiative to solve a business problem: Amazon wanted complete
  control over the store that its customers visited on their mobile devices,
  which was impossible with an iPhone due to the 30% shares Apple would take on
  each sale.


  Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, insisted on including a lot of cool features, such
  as a 3D display. However, Amazon did not bother to create a two-way
  conversation with the target audience and they could not define what its value
  would be to customers. Unsurprisingly, the project was a failure due to the
  top-down, change-resistant planning that had been used. Such a process is the
  norm in large organizations and is usually outlined in a document called a
  _feature road map_.


  It gives a clear sense of where we are, where we’re headed, and what features
  we’ll build to get from here to there. It sets expectations about when
  features will be included. It’s also a complete fabrication.


  Providing _outputs_ is not enough_—_our customers are looking for _outcomes._
  This is the new definition of a product or service that is “done”.
f_conclusion: >-
  Sense and respond methods rely on a continuous feedback loop_—_an ongoing
  conversation between our organizations and the people they serve. This way of
  navigating uncertainty has been developed in parallel across many disciplines
  with methods like agility, design thinking and lean startup. Taken together,
  these methods are the future, and our challenge now is to look at our
  organizations and institutions and evolve them—or risk seeing them replaced by
  newcomers.

  "It starts with the notion that we don’t have all the information we’d like to

  it starts with a certain amount of humility, a quality that is often in short
  supply in business."

Together, Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden have spent years working with digital product teams and the companies that support them. They’ve helped teams launch digital businesses, and trained individuals, teams, and leaders around the world. They wrote their first book, _Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience_ that is widely regarded as one of the most important User Experience books in recent years.

With their followup, _Sense and Respond: How Successful Organizations Listen to Customers and Create New Products_, they teach us how to take the structures and methods of software companies and apply them to organizations of all kinds and sizes in order to maintain a two-way conversation with customers and create new products despite uncertainty. The term “sense and respond” describes the basic mechanism, the feedback loop, at the center of this approach.

Are you practicing sense and respond? Do you know what your customers value, or are you only assuming? Grab a colleague, start a discussion and speak with customers to see where you can get a foothold on this path.
