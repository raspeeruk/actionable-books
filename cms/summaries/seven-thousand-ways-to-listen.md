  ### Deep Listening


  > "Deep listening is more than hearing with our ears, but taking in what is
  revealed in any given moment with our body, our being, our heart."- Susan
  McHenry, Seven Thousands Ways to Listen, page 83


  Did you know there are seven thousand living languages on Earth? When Nepo
  learned this information from a Nigerian linguist friend, it stood to reason
  there must then be at least seven thousand ways to listen.


  Hearing is distinct from listening. The former occurs physically when a signal
  is generated in the ear that gathers discrete pieces of information from all
  the senses and sends the aggregate to the brain. The latter is an innate
  process that integrates an array of sensations we encounter through different
  ways of knowing (sight, smell, touch, taste and sound).


  To practice deep listening, we’re urged to learn how to keep emptying and
  opening. Such expansion is a personal pilgrimage that takes time plus a
  willingness to circle back. Ironically, the author came to the awareness that
  there exists a different way of being (and interacting with the world) as his
  own hearing was breaking down.

  ### Table Questions


  > "A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old
  dimensions."- Oliver Wendell Holmes, Seven Thousand Ways to Listen, page 120


  These questions are intended to be asked over dinner or coffee with friends
  and loved ones. The suggestion is to try listening to everyone’s response
  before discussing.


  Here is a series of meaningful conversation starters:


  *   **Consider how experience has excavated a depth in you.** What has been
  opened in you?

  *   **Tell the story of a time when you were slow to listen to a change that
  was unfolding in your life.** In retrospect, what were the signs you were
  given that change was happening? How did not listening impact you?

  *   **Tell the story of a moment when giving and receiving seemed
  indistinguishable.** What did this moment teach you?

  *   **Discuss a situation you lived through in which the truth involved more
  than just your point of view.** How do you now understand what happened?

  *   **In the next week, stop and listen without expectation to another
  person.** This includes their actual words, below their words, the space that
  surrounds them and the presence you feel once they leave. Can you listen to
  the silence beneath their presence?

  ### Journal Questions


  > "Can you hold the door of your tent open to the firmament?"- Lao Tzu, Seven
  Thousand Ways to Listen, page 22


  To encourage us to listen to the part of us that life is trying to wake, we’re
  offered Reflective Pauses throughout. These taking-stock points are an
  invitation to close our eyes, inhale and exhale, and literally breathe in the
  core messages conveyed.


  These “meditations” are followed by journal questions. Here are some
  especially provocative examples of inquiries to which we can scribe our
  responses:


  *   **Describe a learning you were born with and how you came to discover
  this**. Where does this learning live in you now?

  *   **Describe a moment in which you briefly lost your way and what this did
  to you.** What if anything was disturbing about this? What if anything was
  beneficial or growth-enhancing?

  *   **Is there a feeling you’re currently avoiding or running away from?**
  Why? What would happen if you let that feeling touch you?

  *   **Trace your own history and evolution as a listener.** Describe three key
  experiences that have shaped what listening has meant to you. What have you
  heard along the way that has opened you to life and your place in it?

  *   **Which part of you – deep listener, speaker or questioner – is the most
  experienced?** Which needs more of your attention? If each is a teacher, what
  has each taught you?
f_conclusion: >-
  Typically, we filter what we hear through what we believe. This tendency
  limits what we take in to only that which is familiar. According to Mark Nepo,
  much of our trouble comes from the rigidity of obsolete definitions of
  ourselves and the world. As with hardening of the arteries, stale thinking
  becomes a silent killer.

> "We add to our suffering when life changes and we still behave as if it hadn’t." _\- Seven Thousand Ways to Listen, page 7_

In _Seven Thousand Ways to Listen: Staying Close to What is Sacred_, poet and philosopher Mark Nepo offers us ancient and contemporary practices to reflect upon the life we’ve been given. Throughout this enlightening volume, we’re invited to find the language of our own wisdom. The net result is a tapestry of deep reflection, memoir and meditation designed to create a remarkable guide on how to listen more fully.

According to Mark Nepo, much of our trouble comes from the rigidity of obsolete definitions of ourselves and the world. As with hardening of the arteries, stale thinking becomes a silent killer.

Instead, when we can accept that beyond every so-called answer awaits a larger question, we truly begin to live. If anything, it’s when we lose our “map” of how the world supposedly works that our real knowledge of the path begins.

Being lost can be a prelude to a deeper way. Once we admit we’re not sure where life is taking us, we’re ripe for transformation.

Beyond every arrival awaits an unforeseen beginning. I personally look forward with great anticipation to what’s around the next corner!
