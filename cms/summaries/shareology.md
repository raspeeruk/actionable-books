  ### Brands are people, too


  > "Giving value, sharing stories and information, being the go-to resource,
  helping people solve their problems--all of these human activities make us
  more attractive as brands to the people we want to employ and do business
  with."- Shareology, page 36


  I always knew that a brand needs to add value, at times entertain, and avoid
  being too stiff with corporate speak. One thing that _Shareology_ references
  several times is the rule of thirds. You need to have one third news, one
  third ideas, and one third curated content for good balance in your sharing.
  Moving forward, I’ll use the rule of thirds to further develop online
  branding, marketing, and sharing strategies. The rule of thirds will help to
  create variety in the ways that we look to add value.


  Kramer also talks about letting people see “behind the curtain” to see the
  real people behind the brand. I’m really excited to roll out a social sharing
  strategy that highlights both clients and agents to make the brand more human.

  ### It’s all about context


  > "Understanding context means understanding all factors that influence an
  experience, which also includes how people talk about it (and with whom)."-
  Shareology, page 26


  Kramer talks about social listening in terms of focus groups. Market research
  used to include gathering a relatively small number of people together to get
  their opinions on a product or service. Now, millions of people can talk about
  products and services all over the world and we have the ability to “listen”
  to what they have to say and then develop our online strategy accordingly,
  almost in real time. Even the simplest searches or social listening tools can
  give us _so_ much insight into what others are saying about our brands or our
  industries. And then we can use that information to make our posts better
  suited to help out our own audiences.


  To help us out with creating content in the right context, Kramer briefly goes
  over The Four Rules of Context from his previous book. (Number 2 is my
  greatest area of opportunity.) When you are creating content, remember to:


  1.  Think it through. How will what you share contribute to your brand and
  meet your objectives? Is there is a purpose? Will this detract from your brand
  or your goals in any way?

  2.  Skip to the last page first. You have to know where you are going in order
  to lead your audience there. As Kramer says, “comples systems work becuase
  there’s a beginning and an end point…Complicated systems have one or the
  other.”

  3.  Slow down. We’re all guilty of posting because we need to. You may have
  heard the mantra, “done is better than perfect” but I disagree. Slow down and
  put in the appropriate effort. Otherwise, why bother?

  4.  Get out of your head. It’s so important to think about your content from
  the perspective of your audience.

  ### Lend a helping hand


  > "The main goal of active listening on social channels shouldn’t be to sell
  someone something, but to help someone get something done."- Shareology, page
  73


  It’s absolutely necessary for all companies to be online. I think that one of
  the most challenging parts of taking a company online, or improving a
  company’s online presence, is to make sure you aren’t selling all the time. I
  love, love, love the idea of taking selling out of the equation and focusing
  on helping. If we share this article, this video, this meme, etc., how does it
  help our audience?


  The purpose of online channels, branding, signage… everything is to create
  more business. So it seems counterintuitive to hop online and NOT focus on
  driving sales. But isn’t your business helping customers fill some need?
  Aren’t you ultimately in business to help people!? By striving to help your
  audience learn more or do more, you will in fact build a loyal following with
  your product. And your company values will shine through.

  As much as I would like to include everything I took from _Shareology_, it
  just wasn’t possible. You’ll notice that I wasn’t able to touch on the
  importance of measuring your social strategy or how to focus on influencers.
  As far as I’m concerned, those will be part of the second phase of
  implementing a new social strategy with my new company. Now that I’ve outlined
  my new strategy, I’d love to hear about yours in the comments below. I hear
  that it’s human to share and that we should share to help each other. \*wink\*

Bryan Kramer, who also wrote the bestselling book, _There is no B2B or B2C: It’s Human to Human H2H_, has followed up with a book about how and why we share information, experiences, and emotions in _Shareology: How Sharing is Powering the Human Economy_. Kramer focuses on what makes people share, and relates it to how you can make your brand human, shareable, and valuable to your audience.

I’ve worked in the social media space for several years. My team and I never had formal training in social posts (does such a thing really exist?) so we learned a lot as we went. Early on we discovered that the posts where people could easily make a connection were the most popular. One of our early popular posts was a dog with floppy ears running through a field. Our business had nothing to do with dogs, but it made people smile and laugh. There was a human connection.

In _Shareology_, Kramer took that notion of making a connection to a new level for me. He helped me to grasp some of the ideas that I already knew about online sharing and really begin to strategize with them.
