  ### Age Isn't Just a Number


  > "Nevertheless, people who reach middle age are living longer than in the
  past, and the length of lives of adults keep stretching out, between one and
  two and a half years every decade."- Shock of Gray, page 76-77


  Sarasota, Florida – flippantly titled “God’s Waiting Room” – is a
  retirement-friendly city in what has become the oldest state in the United
  States. “_More than 3.3 million people over age sixty-five – nine out of every
  fifty residents – lived in the Sunshine State in 2010_” (page 20), a
  population segment expected to rise about 115,000 people every year until 2030
  at least. Sarasota has become a destination for people over 65, due in part to
  their focus on funding and infrastructure geared towards our older
  populations. _“The region has become a kind of Silicon Valley for aging
  services, with a cluster of businesses, social services, and academic centers
  that create ever-new ways to serve older clients.”_ (page 38). In Spain, the
  government is creating programs to increase immigration to supplement their
  low fertility as women there (as around the world) are getting married later
  and having fewer children later in life. Japan, worried about the affects of
  an aging population on Tokyo’s version of Disneyland, has begun to host flower
  shows and a circus in order to attract its older citizens. The changes are
  inevitable, opening the doors to many opportunities for us younger generation.

  ### Future Joe


  > "It’s going to be someone’s job to care for all these people and I have a
  hard time seeing how society will manage."- Shock of Gray, page 277


  As we get older and continue (or start!) planning our own futures, we need to
  keep in mind that the challenges our governments, our economies and our
  industries are experiencing right now will still exist. They’re very likely
  going to improve some of the more dire and immediate issues but new challenges
  will arise and less urgent situations will become more urgent. What are you
  doing to protect yourself and your family? How can you contribute to your
  community now that will help to mitigate and improve the situation for the
  future? It may be as simple as implementing a succession plan into your
  organization, or lobbying your politicians for tax structures and savings
  incentives. It’s a shift in our mindset, from passive trust that someone else
  will take care of us when we’ve reached our Golden Years to intentional
  activity, ensuring our own security to the best of our ability.

  ### Active Age


  > "Philips and its competitors in the global home-health-care market benefit
  from an innovation boom aimed at commercializing technology suited to an aging
  population that craves independence at nearly any cost."- Shock of Gray, page
  345-346


  Decreased birth rates, urbanization of our populations, more women in the
  workforce and greater access to education and collective global experiences
  have all contributed to our oldest old staying older for longer. And with
  their higher incomes, better health and desire to work in passionate pursuits
  beyond retirement, there are many opportunities for us as entrepreneurs and
  forward-thinking business people to create services and build products that
  make for better living. Private long-term facilities are on the rise, as are
  sports leagues, continuing education programs, travel tours and arts and
  culture programs specifically focused on seniors. We can, and should, be
  changing our funding structures and budgets, focusing more effort on our
  changing demographics, to continue to create these types of products and
  services now and into the future, because while it’s our parents and
  grandparents in their Golden Years now, soon it’ll be us.

  _Shock of Gray_ opened my eyes to the reality of our future. The situation
  isn’t as dire in my community as it is elsewhere which gives me a huge
  opportunity to mitigate the issues and start looking at where I can make a
  difference now. With incredible medical advancements, increased standards of
  living as our careers progress and technological progressions making our lives
  more interesting and exciting to live, I’m looking forward to being “the
  oldest old” as long as we can correct some of the economic and environmental
  situations we’re currently facing. As Fishman says, “one of the most potent
  life-extending phenomena in world history has been the rise of literacy over
  the last century” (page 71), so keep reading, keep doing and keep spreading
  the word on what you’re doing and how you can help other also trying to change
  the world.

“The baby boomers are retiring and we’re in trouble.” We’ve been hearing it for years – the fear mongers and naysayers going on about the upcoming shortage of labour, the loss of experience in nearly all our industries in all our sectors. Trouble is – they’re all right. It’s true and the aging of our populations – globally – is happening and it’s happening exponentially faster than any of us are ready for.

In his book, _Shock of Gray,_ Ted C. Fishman examines cultures around the world and the effect aging is having on their infrastructures, mortality rates and virtually every aspect of their communities. From cities and states in the US focusing their financial and social programs towards the oldest in their populations, to Spanish and Japanese immigration and mortgage incentives offered to mitigate losses of their younger population, each and every community around the world is feeling the effects of smaller families and increased life spans. In _Shock of Gray_, Fishman explains his research and uses statistics to help us understand what we can do about it.
