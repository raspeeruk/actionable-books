  ### Redefining Unapologetic


  > "Fear of failure I thought, will never be our downfall as a company. Not
  that any of us thought we wouldn’t fail; in fact we had every expectation that
  we would. But when we did fail, we had faith we’d do it fast, learn from it,
  and be better for it."- Shoe Dog, page 254


  I’ve heard (you may have as well) the term unapologetic used before. Typically
  in advice lists, like top characteristics of successful leaders or
  entrepreneurs. You read it, you think you get it, you move on. Knight’s story
  is the truest meaning of not just the word, but its essence. If you’ve ever
  thought about what it actually looks like or feels like in practice, _Shoe
  Dog_ is it. Phil Knight is first and foremost a runner, accountant by trade,
  Oregonian, and had a pretty good idea. Take all the stereotypical
  characteristics from those titles and put them together in the best way. His
  combination of intelligence, stubbornness, and relentless drive continuously
  drove his success. Was he always the best? No. Did he always handle things in
  the best way? Absolutely not. So why did he succeed? Because he went for it.
  He made decisions and he handled things in a way that was true to himself.
  Unapologetic doesn’t mean bulldozing over people or mistakes, Phil Knight is
  the opposite. He felt every rough patch. However, he didn’t let that stop
  them, instead he let it fuel them. Unapologetic is owning your responsibility
  as your true self. When you do that, you’re tribe will come (GEM #1) and they
  will stay with you (GEM #2).

  ### It Meant Something


  > "It’s never just business. It never will be. If it ever becomes just
  business, that will mean that business is very bad."- Shoe Dog, page 370


  Continuing the storyline from insight #1, the relationships that Knight and
  the team created always meant something to them. Even if it was dealing with
  bankers (who Knight often struggled with), competitors, or their endorsed
  athletes it was always meaningful and had a purpose to them. The hard
  relationships taught them invaluable lessons and their star athletes,
  customers, and business partners fueled their love and passion for what they
  were doing. Knight often scores himself throughout the book on how he thinks
  he did in certain situations. This occurs mostly in difficult situations where
  he would often give himself a sub-par grade. Some may see this as a quirk, but
  I believe it to be a fundamental indication of his successes. The ability to
  take situations, the good and the bad ones, and to critically evaluate and
  take meaning in them allowed Knight to stay humble, to not get ahead of
  himself, or repeat the same mistakes. I would argue this meant something to
  the tribe that created Blue Ribbon and eventually Nike, which they respected
  in him as a leader.

  ### The Tribe


  > "Don’t tell people how to do things, tell what to do and let them surprise
  you with their results."- Shoe Dog, page 302


  What is most clear is that the success and creation of Nike was the
  accumulation of a hardworking and dedicated tribe. As Blue Ribbon grew and
  Knight continued to encounter all sorts of individuals, it was very clear to
  see who belonged. As the tribe continued to evolve and bring others in it they
  gained momentum. There was a common work ethic, belief, and understanding of
  what they contributed and what was expected of themselves and each other. All
  were asked to do things outside their skillset and comfort zones. All answered
  unwaveringly and with great success. The takeaway here is to not underestimate
  those you work with or are friends with that you feel “just gets it.” There
  are people you may have encountered that if you had the chance to build your
  own empire you would hire on the spot irrespective of the role (or even if it
  existed). They did that every time. In addition, Knight trusted that once a
  proven member they were fully trusted. They relied on each person’s best and
  worst qualities to keep each other accountable. Time and again different team
  members were entrusted with varying tasks and Knight gave them space to figure
  it out. This created deep personal investments and engagement from their team.
  No matter your friend group, work group, or if you’re starting your own
  business, consider your tribe carefully and how you create a culture for every
  member to be successful.

If you want the Keys to the VIP for business, this book is a one stop shop. In Phil Knight’s memoir _Shoe Dog_ he takes us through the inception of Nike to its IPO. It’s relatable, real, humbling and most importantly: unapologetic. What Phil and the other founding fathers felt and continued to try to define as Nike’s brand has remained true to this day. An incredible feat that didn’t go without its own turmoil and potentially career ending risks, Knight peels back the onion on it all. There is plenty to take away – everything from business acumen, marketing, sales, entrepreneurship, self-improvement, work-life balance, etc. You get it all from whichever lens you take. Below are some of my more noteworthy learnings.

“I told Bowerman about my trip around the world. Kobe, Jordan, the Temple of Nike.”

The above quote (which Knight subtly drops early on) foreshadows the magnitude that Nike becomes at a time where he was struggling with the notion to even commit to his idea. A constant throughout the book is a true and unwavering passion for not only running (obviously), but sport in general. He often analogizes using running as an example. Problems were often solved by 6 mile runs or watching a race. You still feel this today, now across multiple sports, Nike’s unwavering commitment to the essence of competition and winning. Knight and the team never lost sight of this throughout their journey. Knight is an unapologetic entrepreneur who found and maintained a winning team (or tribe) that together created meaning in their passion to become the ultimate shoe dog.
