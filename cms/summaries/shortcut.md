  ### Effective analogies use abstractions


  > "In any analogy, there are going to be similarities and differences between
  the objects of comparison. The key is determining which are most relevant."-
  Shortcut, page 123


  When coming up with an analogy or mental shortcut, the connections we identify
  between two unrelated topics can be instrumental in persuading or convincing
  someone. The author uses the example of the 2005 confirmation hearing for
  Supreme Court Judge John Roberts.


  During his hearing, Roberts used a baseball analogy comparing judges to
  umpires to convince people that, given his conservative philosophy, he would
  be a fair and unbiased judge. He said, “Judges are like umpires. Umpires don’t
  make the rules; they apply them.”


  Roberts “psychologically anchored” his argument, convincing listeners about
  the similarities between judges and umpires and overlooking the main
  difference: that judges can in fact change laws. This analogy was effective
  because of the associations that come with using it. Everyone is familiar with
  baseball and the umpire’s role in the game. Pollack believes that once this
  shortcut was planted in the listener’s mind, “the burden of disproving it
  falls on those who doubt its accuracy.”


  Since our brains are programmed to look for patterns and similarities to what
  we already know, emphasizing the similarities between two unrelated topics is
  what makes analogies so effective. Adding emotions to them can boost
  persuasion, as we’ll see in the first GEM.

  ### Use narratives or stories to enhance comprehension and retention


  > "As humans, we generally dislike uncertainty. To address this dislike, we
  construct coherent stories to help us structure the constant flood of incoming
  data we encounter, and then infer meaning from those stories."- Shortcut, page
  125


  A narrative can make an analogy more memorable and understandable. Stories
  help with the flow of information constantly coming at us, providing our
  brains with a shortcut. Narratives respond to how our brains work.


  The reason that narratives work so well is due to the way people use their
  cognitive resources. The author cites research stating that the use of
  cognitive efforts requires glucose and our brains, wanting to conserve
  glucose, are programmed to follow the path of least resistance. When our brain
  stores new information, remembering stories is an efficient way to remember
  since analogies are basically condensed narratives. Pollack adds, “People’s
  minds seek efficient ways to compress mental data.”


  According to the author, a clear and articulate story is easier to understand
  and “when stories are easier to grasp, listeners are more apt to accept both
  the storyteller and their story’s conclusions as credible.”

  ### Emotional analogies are compelling motivators


  > "Emotions, once triggered, are like a genie released from a bottle--hard to
  recapture and cork. And given that emotion often trumps reason, this is one
  reason why analogies can be so hard to parry."- Shortcuts, page 127


  Good, memorable analogies resonate emotionally and are loaded with powerful
  connotations and subjective ideas. The feelings and emotions that they trigger
  makes them powerful persuaders.


  The author believes this often happens subconsciously, without us realizing
  it, adding “The battle between fact and feeling commonly takes place beyond
  our awareness, as our subconscious searches out evidence that makes us feel
  good about what we already think.”


  The most convincing mental shortcuts often use arousing sentiment generated by
  emotions to overcome logic. If combined with a memorable anecdote, the analogy
  is even more forceful.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book is highly recommended, as it can improve your decision making and
  increase awareness of when analogies are used to persuade. So, the next time
  you’re trying to influence someone, add a short and easy to understand analogy
  to make your point more convincing. Combine it with a coherent story and an
  emotional appeal to boost your credibility and persuasion power.

> "The perfect analogy makes things as simple as possible, but no simpler." _\- Shortcut, page 182_

Analogies are shortcuts for our mind, where we use something familiar to explain something unfamiliar. These mental shortcuts help us to persuade, make people understand complex topics and according to Pollack “help us see novel connections and relationships-insights that can unlock unrealized potential.”

Analogies are everywhere and are an efficient way to process the flood of information that we face each day. In John Pollack’s _Shortcut: How Analogies Reveal Connections, Spark Innovation, and Sell our Greatest Ideas,_ he helps us to recognize them, and to know when to use them to persuade, innovate or increase someone’s understanding.

Pollack is a former Presidential speechwriter and journalist, and has written three other books. He also built and sailed a 22-foot ship made entirely out of cork and is currently a consultant and writer in New York.
