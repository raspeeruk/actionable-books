  ### Help others see what you see


  > "The best gift we can give ourselves is learning how to show and tell. The
  best gift we can give one another is an extraordinary presentation."- Show and
  Tell, page 256


  There are three simple rules to creating an extraordinary presentation:


  1.  **Tell the truth** – Telling the truth in our presentations is to lead
  with the heart. It’s where we communicate our passion, our excitement, and
  it’s the foundation of engagement.

  2.  **Tell it with a story** – Using the story to communicate our ideas makes
  the concepts clear, and the ideas more memorable. A story is a way of
  structuring, and it includes the listener.

  3.  **Tell the story with pictures** – Help the audience see what you mean by
  using pictures. They can see what you see, and then some! Using pictures
  captures the imagination. And that brings us back to engagement.

  ### Lead with the eye and the mind will follow


  > "The ideal picture is as simple as a clear sentence. It enters our eye and
  tells a story. It doesn’t call much attention to itself."- Show and Tell, page
  233


  According to Roam, “In order to illustrate any story, we need only six
  pictures.”


  Use the appropriate pictures depending on the question/topic we are
  illustrating. If we are talking about…


  *   Who/What? = Portrait. Shows our players and objects.

  *   How much? = Chart. Shows how much there is.

  *   Where? = Map. Shows where they are located and overlap.

  *   When? = Timeline. Shows their sequence in time.

  *   How? = Flowchart. Shows the chains of cause, effect, and influence.

  *   Why? = Equation. Shows the moral of the story.


  This makes it so easy! What are you trying to illustrate? Choose the
  appropriate picture. You then have options. Will it be a photo, a graphic or a
  drawing? Feel free to be creative. However, don’t miss this step. We’ve all
  heard it time and again. We know that too many words on a slide can be painful
  to look at. We’ve had to do it too many times! So, now you know what to do.
  What are you trying to illustrate? Choose the picture. Choose the type of
  picture. Illustrate your presentation.

  ### Lead with a story and understanding will follow


  > "After we’ve finished presenting, how do we want our audience to be
  different from when we started?"- Show and Tell, page 40


  This is the question that needs to be answered in order to pick the right
  storyline. Roam makes it easy. He outlines that each storyline has the same
  elements: main idea, main storyline, supporting ideas, one last hook. How
  these elements are presented, and how they support each other, makes for the
  difference in what we want our audience to hear. There are four different
  storylines:


  1.  **The Report** presents data. This is intended to change the audience’s
  information.

  2.  **The Explanation** shares knowledge. It tells the audience about
  something, or how to do something.

  3.  **The Pitch** shares a problem as well as the solution. It’s persuasive.
  With the pitch, the objective is to change the audience’s actions.

  4.  **The Drama** takes the audience on a journey. Changing the audience’s
  beliefs is the goal with the pitch.


  Determining the right storyline suddenly makes crafting this presentation
  relatively straightforward. When you know that you are presenting a Report,
  you have no need to try to fit that into a Drama outline. That would feel like
  putting a square peg into a round hole!
f_conclusion: >-
  I was pleasantly surprised by what I learned from this little book full of
  illustrations. It’s full of very applicable concepts, quite logically
  presented. Putting even a few of the ideas into practice will most certainly
  improve any presentation. Although the author spends little time on the skill
  of presenting in this book, he sets us up for success with the format for the
  presentation. And, I believe he’s right when he says “when we trust our idea
  and are confident, we will enjoy our time onstage and we will help our
  audience change.”

> "At any presentation, the audience is investing a part of their lives in us. Let’s give them a show." _\- Show and Tell, page 255_

Have you ever been in this position? You’re planning a presentation, you’ve opened up your PowerPoint program, you’re looking at that first blank slide, and now what?

Well, if you are looking for ways to capture your ideas, and communicate them to your audience so that they think “Wow!”, _Show and Tell_ is the book for you. Dan Roam outlines, in a fun, creative and very doable way, the elements needed in the structure of an extraordinary presentation. This book is full of illustrations, and also packed with very usable information. He takes us through the “Three Rules of Presentations”, how to balance the information you present, the different structures of presentations, and making the most of visuals.

Although presenters always ought to strive to be engaging, and to tell a great story, knowing that there are different ways to tell different stories makes it easier. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you’ll want to create a presentation style that will change the audience in the way you intend. Do you want to change the audience’s _information_? Then, that is what team status meetings, financial updates, quarterly reports and project overviews are for. Do you want to change the audience’s _abilities_? You do that with an academic paper, a how-to show or a class lecture. How about changing the audience’s _actions_? That is the role of a job interview, sales pitch or product launch. Creating presentations that might change an audience’s _beliefs_? These are the commencement address, the sermon or the TED Talk.

Knowing what you want your audience to experience, and taking them on that journey is no accident. It requires a well designed presentation.
