  ### Share every day


  > "A daily dispatch is even better than a resume or portfolio, because it
  shows what we’re working on right now"- Show Your Work, page 48


  There is a whole chapter devoted to this idea. It is simple, share something
  publicly every day. It can be work in progress, something inspiring the work
  process, a snippet of work you are doing. This idea can help in two ways:


  1\. Builds an online portfolio/journal  

  2\. Forces work to be done – accountability.


  I am way more likely to sit down and write another scene in my play than watch
  a show, if I am committed to sharing every day. In the book, Kleon draws
  attention to the fact that people don’t care so much what project someone
  worked on two years ago, or even last month – what is being worked on right
  now? Share it.  

  While this is the The Big Idea for me, I haven’t started doing it yet. Every
  day that I don’t create and share something is a step back from attracting
  people to my work.

  ### It is okay to make money


  > "We all have to get over our ‘starving artist’ romanticism and the idea that
  touching money inherently corrupts creativity. Some of the most meaningful and
  most cherished cultural artifacts were made for money"- Show Your Work, page
  163


  About a year ago, the director of a school I studied at was in my city. We
  were touring the city and I shared with her some program ideas I had. She
  asked me what was stopping me from starting them. I explained that I would
  need to get charitable status, and form a not-for-profit board. She looked at
  me and said, “You know, it’s okay to make money at this”. Since that moment, I
  have found a little less anxiety associated with making money at things I do
  naturally, or creatively. This was another reminder of that lesson.

  ### To hoard is not to hold


  > "Your influences are all worth sharing because they clue people in to who
  you are and what you do –sometimes even more than your own work."- Show Your
  Work, page 77


  Love this. As a teenager, I would proudly wear band shirts and write my
  favorite lyrics onto my binder with a sharpie marker – everyone knew what I
  liked. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve held my favorite bands and books a little
  closer to me. Kleon suggests that people should share their inspirations and
  influences with others, and that sharing can help people feel closer to the
  creator. Lately, many of the artists I follow online have entire newsletters
  all about the music, sites and art they are inspired by. I eagerly absorb this
  information and feel in on a secret. I’ve begun searching for the writers that
  inspired the writers I like – I love their work so much, I want to experience
  the source of their inspiration. If you’re really blown away by something, or
  crushing on something hard – share it.
f_conclusion: >-
  The lovely thing about Kleon’s book is that it is all very do-able. It is
  highly readable and honest. The danger is that the simplicity of the lessons
  make it seem easy. It is not. I believe that if every person who hated
  self-promotion were to integrate just one of the suggestions from this book
  into their marketing, the world would get to see, experience and be inspired
  by a whole new league of artists.

  "I’m going to try and teach you how to think about your work as a never-ending
  process, how to share your process in a way that attracts people who might be
  interested in what you do, and how do deal with the ups and downs of putting
  yourself and your work out in the world"

I never read Kleon’s _Steal Like an Artist_. I will now.

His latest book, _Show Your Work: 10 Ways to Share Your Creativity and Get Discovered_ is a super accessible and very actionable book. I read it in a night, and then a second and third time. It is full of such goodness that it can be overwhelming in one sitting. Each chapter could easily be the focus for an entire week (or month), and this book could be seen as a roadmap for building or expanding an online presence in 10 weeks.

What stops you from sharing your work, process or inspirations? What have you done to overcome that obstacle and get seen?
