  ### Start with One


  > "Every side hustle has a target customer, a specific type of person that its
  product or service is designed for…you can think of them as ‘your people.’"-
  Side Hustle, Day 8, Page 74


  The first week of side hustle month is about your ideas. The second week of
  the program encourages you to get clear about your ideal or target customer.
  The phrase “think of them as ‘your people’” resonated well. In some instances,
  you’ may be your ideal customer, so you can easily describe the pain you feel
  and what you want or need to serve and satisfy yourself. In other instances,
  ‘your people’ are different from you in some critical way and you need to be
  able to clearly describe who your ideal customer is, what they need, why and
  how they are feeling pain, and what they would consider a great product or
  service.


  The author proposes two practical methods to find out more about “your
  people”. If you know one of them, have a coffee. But if you don’t: ‘have an
  imaginary coffee with them’, or write a letter to them. And I would add a
  third, write a blog to them – and post it. Then wait to see what response, if
  any, you get.


  My realization from having a coffee with a colleague, was that ‘my people’ are
  fundamentally different from me in one important characteristic – they lack
  confidence – which makes it easy for me to serve them because I am a great
  encourager.

  ### Focus area #1: How you can change your customer’s life


  > "The best hack of all is to do something that makes a difference in \[your\]
  people’s lives."- Side Hustle, Day 16, Page 140


  A side hustle is, by its nature, something you do on the side, so the best way
  to be efficient is to be laser-focused on improving the experience for the
  customer. This includes learning to:


  \+ Clearly explain what your product or service is, why “your people” will
  benefit and how it works.


  \+ Deliver what you promise, so start simple with your promise, but go above
  and beyond whenever possible.


  \+ Uncover and respond to unspoken needs. If you uncover something else “your
  people” want, offer to help with it at least once at no charge, then start to
  charge for it.


  \+ Find a way to report back to “your people” in some way. People often forget
  how bad the problem was, once it is solved. Get them to write down the pain
  they are feeling before they use your product / service. Quizzes are great for
  this. My partner \[vested interest alert\] asks participants in his
  eOrganising program to complete ‘before and after’ quizzes.


  \+ Make it fun, interesting, or a source of status to write or record a
  testimonial for you. A friend asks for video testimonials from satisfied
  clients. She told me that a young, media savvy client is already planning what
  to say in the testimonial video, so the client is paying careful attention to
  the positive changes she’s making, courtesy of the program.

  ### Create your Origin Story


  > "Like a comic book superhero, your side hustle needs a history \[or
  herstory\]. Don’t just give ‘em the facts; tell them a story/"- Side Hustle,
  Day 10, Page 87


  The author cleverly compares a factual story – a guy went travelling, got
  hitched, the couple saw a business opportunity, bought product cheaply and
  re-sold at a profit – with a ‘feel good’ story. A couple met and fell in love,
  got married in the wife’s home town in the high mountains of Nepal, saw
  cashmere shawls sold cheaply, recognized they would sell well in cold Canadian
  mountains, found suppliers with a complementary commitment to quality, sold
  out the first shipment and gave a percentage of profits to the cashmere
  farmers to educate their children, and now they have a thriving side hustle.
  Both are true, but only one is likely to get you to Google and buy from
  “Corala Cashmere.”


  The author encourages us to look for our own origin story – what is our
  superpower in relation to “our people” and importantly, what is the drama, or
  the ‘turning point’ that gave us our superpower. E.g., for years, I’d wanted
  to write a book, but the voice in my head said “you’re not good enough – you
  don’t have anything interesting to say”. After nine months of agonized
  procrastination on a writing course and staring down the barrel of a missed
  opportunity to promote my as-yet-unfinished book, I realized that the voice in
  my head was both true and misleading. It’s true I wasn’t good enough – yet.
  But the answer wasn’t to give up on the dream, the answer was to write more
  regularly. Now, I confidently encourage others to “just start writing” and
  then re-write, re-write… and get a good editor.
f_conclusion: >-
  The main messages of this book are all about finding “your people” and taking
  action to offer and deliver a great product or experience for them. When in
  doubt, the author says: “send the email.” Reach out to at least 10 people. The
  people who get annoyed are probably not “your people.” Those who are, will be
  pleased you’ve connected with them. But don’t just send an email about you –
  make sure that every communication provides value that makes it worth their
  time to read.

  "Everyone should have a side hustle. Even if you love your job., having more
  than one source of income will give you more freedom and more options."

> "Everyone should have a side hustle. Even if you love your job., having more than one source of income will give you more freedom and more options." _\- Side Hustle, Page 3_

This is a book with heart. It’s aimed at giving people two very valuable gifts. For those who feel stuck and maybe a bit desperate – workers or managers who cannot afford to give up their day jobs, but aren’t getting enough satisfaction from their work – a side hustle provides an extra source of income. But much more importantly, it gives the gifts of more freedom and more options (security). And even for those of us who love our work, having options is valuable in a time when business or government can change our world quickly and dramatically.

This book is a practical guide, designed for the many of us who are busy and impatient. But be warned, this is not a book for reading, this is a book for IMPLEMENTING. If you are a thinker, not a doer, make a commitment to stop at the end of each weekly chapter, and do the work. You’ll thank yourself in a month if you do.
