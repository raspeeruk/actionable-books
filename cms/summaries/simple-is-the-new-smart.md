  ### Dismantle Your Barrier Beliefs


  > "The more you focus on what you can do rather than on what you can’t do, the
  more successful you will be."- Simple is the New Smart, page 89


  A barrier belief is a negative message or image that we’ve internalized over
  time. It stops us from trying something we believe is difficult to do or
  beyond our skillset. It effectively tells us we’ve failed before we even lift
  a finger or open our mouth. Examples that may resonate with you include: “I
  can’t sing.” “I’m not good at sales.” “I can’t think on my feet.” “I could
  never do that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (fill in the blank).”


  Fazio challenges us to examine our barrier beliefs and recognize them for what
  they are – internal messages and assumptions, _not_ facts! Just because you
  haven’t had success doing something in the past, it doesn’t mean you can’t be
  successful now or in the near future. When you catch yourself uttering a
  barrier belief (either about yourself or one of your colleagues), stop and ask
  yourself these questions:


  *   Where did I learn this?

  *   What can I do to break free from this mindset?

  *   What do I need more of in order to change this from ‘can’t do’ to ‘**can
  do**’?


  Based on your answers, select one or two simple things you can do dismantle
  that mental misconception and do them. Similar to learning to tie your shoes
  or mastering the art of delegation, changing a ‘can’t do’ to a ‘_can do_’ will
  take repeated effort and practice before you feel confident and competent. The
  two Insights that follow should help improve your success rate.

  ### What Would Edison Do?


  > "We all fail. If you fail, I want you to fail forward and see failure as
  feedback, a moment, not a permanent barrier."- Simple is the New Smart, page
  18


  Thomas Edison was a prolific inventor with an enviable _can do_ attitude.
  Edison and his team are reported to have conducted 10,000 experiments before
  they discovered the filament to power the incandescent light bulb. Rather than
  labeling these experiments as failures, his team rightly focused on what they
  learned in order to inform their next attempt. Sounds simple in theory, yet in
  the thick of things we often choose to focus on the failure. Which is why I’m
  going to start asking myself “What would Edison do?” as an inspirational
  reminder to look for the learning in my setbacks.


  Fazio shares several other insightful questions that will help you snatch
  victory from the hands of defeat. My favourite example of a failing forward
  question is this reframe:


  “Rather than asking ‘Why am I never getting asked to take on key
  responsibilities at work?’ try asking yourself, ‘What are the people who are
  getting asked to take on key responsibilities doing?’” (And you might add,
  “that I’m not currently doing?”).


  How we interpret and describe our situations, our strengths and our
  limitations shapes what we choose to do next. Being more mindful of what you
  ask and what you tell yourself will make a world of difference on the road to
  success.

  ### Challenge Your Assumptions


  > "The framework EAR will help you be intentional about what you hear."-
  Simple is the New Smart, page 77


  Barrier beliefs are not the only assumptions that need to be confronted if we
  are going to move confidently toward our desired future. We have a bad habit
  of interpreting numerous situations that arise throughout our day using
  erroneous assumptions. Taking a few minutes to challenge our initial reactions
  and thoughts can help us identify more constructive ways of thinking and
  acting.


  Fazio uses the framework EAR to guide this reflection. It looks like this:


  **E**vent – what happened, the situation  

  **A**ssumptions – your initial thoughts, beliefs and feelings about the
  event  

  **R**esult – what happens, the consequence


  He posits that it is our assumptions about a given event that influence the
  outcome, not the event itself. Since we have two ears, and because you
  actually need to work through the framework twice to reap the benefits, I
  think of Fazio’s framework as EARs2! Here’s the example he shares in the book.


  **Round One:  

  **Event – Failure to hit monthly sales numbers.


  Assumptions – I’m not a good leader. No one on the sales team is focused on
  results. We are never going to get out of this mess.


  Results – Feelings of self-doubt, low confidence and motivation; fearful of
  what will happen next; focused on what you can’t control.


  **Round Two:  

  **Event – Failure to hit monthly sales numbers.


  Assumptions – We’re facing a tough situation – it’s an opportunity for the
  team to focus on new tactics. This is disappointing – what can we learn from
  this experience? Our current efforts didn’t pay off – what do we need to do to
  prevent this from happening next month?


  Results – Embrace acceptance and action; adopt positive thinking; focus is on
  what you can control.


  I think it’s clear that round one thinking will keep you demotivated and stuck
  while round two thinking guides you towards problem-resolution mode. Once
  you’ve made the shift to positive, can do thinking, you are ready to implement
  insight #2.

  Fazio set out to write a book to help people adopt simple strategies that
  would help them achieve their dreams faster and with less stress. The common
  thread throughout all the approaches he describes boils down to cultivating an
  ownership mentality and abandoning the victim mentality. When you choose to:

> "The premise of this book is to help you take a direct path toward success through applying simple strategies that work. The best strategies are the ones you apply." _\- Simple is the New Smart, page 20_

The subtitle to Rob Fazio’s book _Simple is the New Smart_ promises readers 26 success strategies _to build confidence, inspire yourself, and reach your ultimate potential_. Like other authors describing pathways to success (e.g. [Stephen Covey](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/), [Michael Hyatt](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/living-forward/), [Charles Duhigg](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/smarter-faster-better-2/)) Fazio believes the key lies in being _intentional about how you approach your work and life goals_ and **taking action.** And like his contemporaries he emphasizes that simple is not necessarily easy (at least not initially).

Fazio groups his lessons and tactics into four categories:

1.  Psychological Swagger – how you think, feel, act.
2.  Reading – what you choose to hear about yourself, your performance and your potential.
3.  Leading – think fast and having the skills and capability to work your plan.
4.  Accelerating – sustaining momentum and accountability.

I appreciated his efforts to describe the success strategies in ways that were **appetizing** (things people want), **digestible** (easy to understand and apply) and **memorable** (easy to recall). There’s actually more than 26 helpful ideas presented between the covers (many of his sub-headings are actionable Insights) so you are bound to find several to add to your repertoire. I chose to focus on strategies that will help me manage my biggest critic and detractor….me!

Your beliefs drive your behaviours. You control your beliefs. It’s simple. Think smart. Be confident. Achieve success.
