  ### Increase your personal value


  > "Personal value consists of the gap between those activities that bring you
  the most happiness and those that keep you from enjoying life to the
  fullest."- Simple Rules, page 147


  Although doing more of what we love and less of what we don’t seems like
  common sense, many people don’t follow thru with this. Maybe they are
  overwhelmed by the process or just don’t know where to start. This is where
  simple rules can help increase follow-through.


  Figuring out a good place to start can be difficult. The authors suggest a few
  thought-provoking questions to get going:


  *   What aspect of your life do you most want to improve?

  *   What activities bring you the greatest happiness and sense of well-being?

  *   Which aspects of your life cause you the most fear, stress, or anxiety?

  *   If you look back in five years, what will you regret not changing?

  *   How might a trusted friend, spouse, or loved one answer these questions
  for you?


  Based on the answers to the above questions, try to narrow it down to a more
  specific objective and see if you can identify a bottleneck. The authors
  describe a bottleneck as “something that stands in the way of achieving one of
  your personal goals.”


  We’ve identified our objectives and bottlenecks and are now ready to move on
  to creating our own simple rules.

  ### Simplify to increase compliance


  > "Complicated solutions can overwhelm people, increasing the odds that they
  will stop following the rules."- Simple Rules, page 13


  The reason that complex rules can be so overwhelming is that many times they
  try to “anticipate every contingency and dictate what to do in each scenario,
  thereby reducing people to automatons who do what they are told.” But in
  organizations and society, situations arise that can’t be predicted and people
  may need to react or respond on the spot.


  The authors also cite a study on personal tax compliance that was undertaken
  in 45 countries. The conclusion was that the best predictor of tax compliance
  was the complexity of the tax code, regardless of tax rates. In other words,
  the tax code with the fewest complex regulations also had the highest
  compliance. That is truly amazing considering that today’s governments are
  fiscally challenged and this would be a great way to raise much-needed funds.


  The key to success in simplifying is to limit the number of rules or
  requirements that need to be followed. Not only is this practical and
  efficient, but according to Sull and Eisenhardt, having a limited number of
  rules “simplifies the cognitive organization of the brain.” It is consistent
  with the way our brains are hardwired to operate. We were built for
  simplicity.

  ### Create your own simple rules


  > "Willpower is a reservoir, not a river, and when it runs out (as it often
  does at the end of a long day), rules can be effective tools for imposing
  limits on behavior."- Simple Rules, page 150


  Crafting your personalized simple rules will increase your chances of
  following through on your action plans created during the step above. Where do
  you start when attempting to create your own simple rules? Sull and Eisenhardt
  recommend investing some time to research multiple sources, such as reaching
  out to role models for advice and ideas, finding pertinent information in
  books or simply reflecting on past personal experience for figuring out what
  didn’t work in the past.


  Some basic requirements for good rules: they should be easy to remember, few
  in number and provide concrete guidance. One of the examples provided in the
  book walks us through the decision-making for someone using an online dating
  site who needed to streamline potential dating opportunities. His bottleneck
  was reviewing profiles and writing introductory messages to prospects. It was
  taking too much time with mixed results. He settled on ‘How’s it going?’,
  which, based on a study, triggered a high a response rate from online daters.
  The salutation was short, easy to remember and took minimal time to write as
  he was browsing prospects.


  Simple rules are also ideal with recurring activities and in situations where
  there are more alternatives than available resources. Since rules also
  function well with channeling willpower, they are great for activities related
  to diet, exercise and saving money.


  The authors recommend keeping track of how well the rules are working.
  Sometimes they may have to be tinkered with to see what needs to change in
  order to get better results and increase compliance.
f_conclusion: >-
  Although simple rules help maintain a strict focus on what matters most,
  simplicity is not easy. Steve Jobs said it best when he expressed that “You
  have to work hard to get your thinking clear to make it simple.” This great
  book demonstrated the practical benefits of simplicity and how to incorporate
  it in our everyday lives. It is up to us to do the heavy lifting and create
  some simple rules to reach our targets. What’s your personal value and what
  rules will you create to increase it?
