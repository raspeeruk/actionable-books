  ### Eight Questions


  > "Far and away the best prize that life offers, is the chance to work hard at
  work worth doing."- Simply Brilliant, page 221


  The above quote from Theodore Roosevelt remains relevant today: work worth
  doing means increasing the level of impact and enriching our levels of
  achievement. Taylor intends to motivate us with this in mind and as he
  suggests the stories are only useful if they contribute to your success. His
  core messages can be collated with the following eight questions, the answers
  to which may give current struggling business owners collective brilliance.


  _1: Can you develop a definition of success that allows you to stand apart
  from the competition and inspires others to stand with you?_


  What struck a consistent chord among “Brilliant” businesses was the single
  minded purpose that they believed to be uniquely theirs, and equally are
  uniquely important. They have a highly developed sense of perspective on how
  they see the world, they offer an intense projection of everything they do,
  they are highly intrusive and built on rock; a lighthouse. Some companies
  describe themselves as operating at the lunatic fringe, and that is why these
  companies are noticed. They operate as missionaries as opposed to mercenaries,
  striving not just for profit but also significance.


  _2: Can you explain, clearly and compellingly, why what you do matters and how
  you expect to win?_


  Brilliant leaders move beyond simple leadership rhetoric and boring acronyms
  to a unique conversational mode of precision, provocation and passion. They
  communicate that what they do is unique and compelling to the outside world.


  _3: Are you prepared to rethink the conventions of success in your field and
  the logic of success as a leader?_


  The analogy, “It is difficult to see the forest because of the trees,” makes
  change difficult for people who have been in the same field for a long time.
  Taylor describes the practice of “provocative competence” as a common thread
  of “Brilliant” leaders. Simply stated, it is the ability to challenge your
  assumptions of your career, think about the future, and recognize that your
  current mindset may be holding you back. How do you make sure that what you
  know doesn’t limit your imagination.


  _4: Are you as determined to stay interested as to be interesting?_


  The most influential and leaders have figured out how to remain interested, in
  the serendipity of life, in the enduring purpose of their enterprise and new
  ways of bringing that mission to life. They have a unique quality to also
  instill this quality in their people. Their organizations are viewed as
  leadership and learning laboratories for business. “Ancora Imparo”; forever
  learning.


  _5: Do you pay as much attention to psychology and emotion as you do
  technology and efficiency?_


  What really stands out in successful business are the small gestures of
  kindness that make us feel empathy and compassion. As Mother Teresa said, “Not
  all of us can do great things but we can do small things with love.”


  _6: Do the values that define how your organization works reflect the values
  proposition around which it competes?_


  You can’t be exceptional in your marketplace creating something special and
  distinctive without programming your culture. Be provocative enough to change
  what people do everyday.


  _7: Are you as humble as you are hungry?_


  Simply stated, your job as a leader/manager is to set the stage, not to
  perform on it. Be humble enough to allow cross pollination of ideas within
  your within organization and outside it.


  _8: Are you prepared to share the rewards of success with all those who had a
  hand in achieving it?_


  The winner takes all approach is a non sustainable way of conducting business.
  The businesses that allow members a seat at the table and a share of the pie
  are able to generate a deep sense of loyalty and engagement with their
  employees.

  ### Kindness Matters


  > "What is it about business that makes it so hard to be kind? What kind of
  leaders have we become when small acts of connection feel so uncommon?"-
  Simply Brilliant, page 138


  A young man was visiting his terminally ill grandmother in hospital about to
  undergo another bout of treatment. She was desperate for a bowl of clam
  chowder from Panera bread. The trouble was that they only sell clam chowder on
  Fridays. The young man explained the situation to the on duty manager—not only
  did they get the soup but also a box of cookies and a get well card. With the
  current younger generation, Facebook of course became involved and Panera
  Bread received an unbelievable amount of free publicity, resulting in 81000
  likes and more than 35000 comments. A simple act of kindness brought more
  positive publicity than any advertising could have generated.


  A similar company, Pret A Manger, allows their employees to give away free
  food for repeat customers (within limits of course), as well as only employing
  friendly and lively employees and extensive training, which creates loyal and
  bonded clients.


  Act on any opportunities for acts of kindness within your industry—you may be
  surprised at the response.

  ### Allies are Ubiquitous


  > "In businesses (and social movements built on ideas), responsibility for
  generating and evaluating ideas has to become everybody's business."- Simply
  Brilliant, page 178


  A Canadian gold miner by the name of Rob McEwen was in financial distress: he
  had acquired a property which left him with a dilemma. Where should they set
  up the mine and where should they dig, based on geological data? Undertaking
  their own expensive exploration and information analysis could bankrupt the
  company. The solution? With the current ethos of open source software, he
  invited the whole world to advise him on where to drill after posting
  geological data online and requesting help. For a fraction of the possibly
  prohibitive costs, the subsequent analysis generated were way ahead of
  anything his team could generate and the information turned the mining
  company’s fortunes around completely. McEwen was humble enough to admit that
  his team did not have the smarts to generate the ideas based on the
  information they had. He recruited an army of willing and motivated engineers
  and scientists by creating a stage for them to perform.


  How could you generate help in your industry?

  try new approaches: stop being boring, and start being brilliant.
