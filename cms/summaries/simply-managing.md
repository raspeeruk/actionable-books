  ### An Integrated Whole


  > "An organization is an interacting network, not a vertical hierarchy.
  Effective managers work throughout; they do not sit on top. Out of this
  network emerge strategies as engaged people solve little problems that can
  grow into big strategies… To manage is to help bring out the positive energy
  that exists naturally within people. Managing thus means engaging, based on
  judgement, rooted in context. Leadership here is a sacred trust earned from
  the respect of others."- Simply Managing, location 1874


  Mintzberg broadens the perception of management by insisting that managers
  move through a multidimensional space, requiring a variety of mindsets, and
  managing (as opposed to attempting to fix) the unresolvable and inevitable
  paradoxes of a complex work environment. It’s a question of balance (getting
  it right!), and really knowing yourself (and when you need others) and your
  context. The purpose of managing is to ensure that your sphere of
  responsibility serves _its_ basic purpose.


  Mintzberg presents a conceptual model of managing that places the manager
  between their unit of responsibility and the rest of the organization, as well
  as the context that surrounds the organization. From this junction point,
  Mintzberg describes the elements of his model, beginning with Three Mindsets.


  Effective managing is a blend of art, craft and science. The ART mindset
  provides the vision and creative insights – here’s the inspiration and
  passion. Experience and practical learning provide the CRAFT mindset. And
  SCIENCE, arguably the exalted managerial mindset to the exclusion of the other
  two in the popular view of management, encompasses analysis and a regard for
  systemic evidence. The combination of all three is required. Could be all
  well-balanced in one person, but that’s not been my experience! Being someone
  who relishes working creatively with others, I can see how a truly integrated
  team can be successful in fully and ideally representing a blend of these
  mindsets.


  Building from these mindsets, Mintzberg sees them blending and operating on
  different planes, performing different roles. Mintzberg discusses each aspect
  of the model in turn and then pulls everything together in conclusion. Namely,
  that managing is doing and leading and dealing and linking and controlling and
  communication and more – all blend together in a combination of art, science
  and craft. A focus on any of these functions, planes, or roles to the
  exclusion of the whole will put the whole organization out of whack.


  “We have all experienced lopsided managing, whether due to the detachment of
  strategizing, the heavy – handedness of controlling, or the self-absorption of
  narcissistic leading.**”** Thus, he broadens our perception of managing, and
  explains the interconnectedness and messiness of managing effectively, and how
  it must be practiced holistically.

  ### Culture as Decision Shaping


  > "Leading means helping to establish and strengthen culture. Culture is
  intended to do collectively what other aspects of the leading role do for
  individuals and groups: encourage the best efforts of people by aligning their
  interests with the needs of the organization. In contrast to decision making
  as a form of controlling, culture is decision shaping as a form of leading."-
  Simply Managing, location 618


  I love how this framing of culture as “decision shaping” affirms the
  importance of paying attention to culture. I’ve worked in cultures that are
  built on distrust. They result in tight control and monitoring to ensure
  everyone follows the rules. Unfortunately, this type of culture fails to
  leverage the passions, skills and experiences of the staff with the
  organization’s goals, values and interests. My view is that a culture of
  trust, respect, openness, and learning generates increased organizational
  capacity exponentially. When each staff member is engaged and committed to the
  success of the organization, it means that the culture is supporting and
  shaping their experiences and actions.


  Mintzberg also notes that culture can be built into the very system, depending
  on the type of organization. It might not be so obvious to outsiders (or maybe
  it is!), but libraries have definite cultural norms – built into the hierarchy
  and practices of librarianship. Working with that culture, and yet shaping its
  adaptation in order to achieve continued success as a service organization,
  will be key.

  ### Employee Engagement


  > "There is nothing so powerful, or so natural, as engaged managers who are
  committed to developing themselves, their organizations, and their
  communities."- Simply Managing, location 2065


  The mission of the organization can only be fulfilled with the full
  participation of the people who work there. The organization’s success relies
  on the ability of managers to bring out the best in other people so they can
  make the best decisions for the organization as they go about their daily
  work.


  My work setting is a library. If we’re successful in supporting the
  development of staff, then those folks who deal first-hand with the public
  will be inclined to commit to the success of each and every person who walks
  into the library. And that, in turn, shows the organization’s commitment to
  developing the community.
f_conclusion: >-
  Lest anyone think that management is an easy gig, _Simply Managing_ should set
  them straight. To be effective as a manager, one has to acknowledge the
  complexity of the work, engage in honest reflective practices, and commit to
  the success of those you lead. We all face different circumstances – and that,
  as well as who you are as a person, impacts how you perform your work.
  Experience by experience, we bring ourselves wholly and personally into the
  work and, if effective, can take satisfaction in the success of others. For my
  part, the framing of the organization as a community of engaged people
  resonates and inspires.

  "What could be more natural than to treat our organizations, not as mystical
  hierarchies of authority, but as communities of engagement, where every member
  is respected and so returns that respect?"

> "What could be more natural than to treat our organizations, not as mystical hierarchies of authority, but as communities of engagement, where every member is respected and so returns that respect?" _\- Simply Managing, location 2091_

Henry Mintzberg, a leading thinker and academic, writes prolifically on management and business strategy. His books challenge the norms and offer countering views. Always inclined to swim in less popular streams, I was attracted to Mintzberg’s alternative approaches, and curious to read his thoughts on management.

His book, _Simply Managing_: _What Managers Do – and Can Do Better_ is a shortened version of his previous book, _Managing_. It is designed for busy managers – an appealing goal similar to that of Actionable Books! Mintzberg forgoes chapter summaries and extended narrative in favour of bolding key messages and summarizing his models with functional diagrams; useful and much appreciated by this time-challenged executive.

_Simply Managing_ brings in a reality that resonates and lends weight to his message. When he acknowledges the hectic pace and volume of interruptions that is the daily reality of a manager, you know he knows what he’s talking about. He describes the unrelenting pace of managing; “the brevity, variety, discontinuity of its activities; the orientation to action; the favouring of informal and oral forms of communication; the lateral nature of managing (with colleagues and associates); and control in this job as implicit more than explicit.”

It’s reassuring to hear the reality acknowledged, to feel understood. The management models, the knowledge he conveys, and the wisdom he imparts caused me to think differently about my management practice.
