  ### Bigger Than Your Job Description


  > "He's taken his passion for the industry he serves and mixed it with his
  interest in new media and expanded his job description."- Referencing
  Christopher S. Penn, Six Pixels of Separation, page 114


  There’s the distinct possibility that you’re tired of hearing about social
  media. Tired of reading (here and elsewhere) about Facebook, Twitter, “Web
  2.0”, and social networking. I’m going to respectfully argue that if that’s
  the case, you actually haven’t heard enough about the digital world. Because
  if this stuff is obnoxious to you, you’re missing the point. Social media is
  an opportunity; without question the greatest opportunity presented to us, as
  a species, in the last 200 years.


  Not long ago, Christopher S. Penn (mentioned above) was an unknown executive
  at the Student Loans Network. Understanding the fiercely competitive nature of
  his industry, Penn created a daily
  [podcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) called “Financial Aid Post”…
  and he did it with style. Integrating music, interviews, stories and pertinent
  information on student loans into an entertaining radio show, Penn quickly
  rose in fame and credibility. Having now been featured in the Wall Street
  Journal and the New York Times and making appearances on CNN, PBS and ABC
  News, Penn is now a nationally recognized expert on the topic and is a highly
  sought after speaker.


  And this is the point – Penn saw an opportunity to bring his subject matter to
  life; to inject a typically dry topic with his own personality and passion. He
  did it for little-to-no-cost, he did it utilizing little in technical skill,
  and he did it online. And you can do the same thing.


  The power of social media and the myriad of platforms you can broadcast from
  (most of them free) is levelling the playing field. For the first time in
  centuries, those with passion can compete with those with money. And they
  often win.

  ### Pick Your Battles


  > "Be curious about everything, but ruthless in what you get involved with."-
  Six Pixels of Separation, page 158


  As mentioned, there’s a lot of noise out there. There are also an unwieldy
  number of places you can be joining (or starting) conversations. It’s
  impossible to be everywhere, in fact. The internet has become a place of
  “skimming” – cruising from site to site, reading a bit here or a bit there,
  absorbing content at your own pace and on your own schedule. Which is
  fantastic as a consumer, but a disaster as a producer. If you pop up here or
  there without taking the time to establish yourself – to build credibility and
  connections – you’ll get lost in the sea of voices. Better to go deep on a few
  select channels. If you’re planning to blog, blog. Comment on other blogs, but
  don’t get caught up in trying to have a presence in every social network or on
  every platform available. Be strategic, not scattered. Understand what mediums
  work best for you and dig in. Better to own the pond than disappear in the
  sea. As Joel says in _Six Pixels of Separation_, _“‘Do one thing great’ is,
  without a doubt, the biggest lesson you should apply to your online
  endeavours.”_ (page 174)


  This is true in life in general, isn’t it? Tiger Woods doesn’t interrupt golf
  practice to work on his jump shot, does he? Stephen King isn’t doing stand up
  comedy in between books. The truly great among us choose an endeavour and
  dedicate themselves to success in that world. I’d encourage you to do the
  same. Once you’re entrenched you can expand, but don’t get scattered too early
  on.

  ### Patience in an ADD World


  > "It's no longer about outbound calls and pressing the flesh at industry
  events - it's about using these online channels to communicate how you think
  and how you speak."- Six Pixels of Separation, page 18


  You’ve probably heard this too, but it’s worth repeating: anything worth doing
  is worth doing well. In the online world “doing something well” means having
  three things: passion, patience and a willingness to go with the flow.


  What element of your job or industry are you passionate about? What aspect of
  the role got you excited in the first place? Write it down. So often we get
  distracted or disheartened by our roles because we lose sight of the big
  picture objective. A blog, a podcast, social network, Twitter or Facebook
  account can be our platform to reconnect and share our passion. (Incidentally,
  _Six Pixels of Separation_ does an excellent job of walking you through not
  only how to set these things up, but also provides tips on how to best start
  and pitfalls to avoid along the way.)


  Find a platform that makes sense for you and start sharing. Start sharing your
  experience, your expertise or your interests. Give likeminded people a place
  to connect with you. And then be patient. There are over 130 million blogs
  catalogued on [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) (the globally leading blog
  index service). That’s a lot of voices. Have faith. Community gathers around
  the individuals and organizations that are authentic, consistent and
  interactive. Keep writing (or podcasting or recording videos) regardless of
  how many followers you have initially. Gary Vaynerchuk, one of the leaders in
  the social media space talks of how his first episode of [winelibrary
  TV](http://tv.winelibrary.com) had one viewer – his grandmother. He now has
  over a million followers on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/garyvee) and tens of
  thousands of daily views of his wildly popular show.


  We all want to be overnight successes, which is why it’s doubly important that
  you engage with topics that feed your passion. Despite the speed of the
  internet, true success takes time. Be patient. Be persistent, but be patient.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Six Pixels of Separation_ is, frankly, better than I expected. It’s a book
  full of practical tips and great resources as mentioned. More than that
  though, it has an underlying sensibility of what’s possible in the digital
  world when you get past the hype and frantic rush from one platform to the
  next. For the first time ever, public attention is “driven by time vested –
  and not by money invested.” (page 5) It’s an exciting era, one destined to be
  dominated by those who care.

I had the pleasure of meeting Mitch Joel in Calgary a couple weeks ago backstage at The Art of Marketing. While I was chagrined at the fact I hadn’t read his book yet, I took the time to complement him on his accomplishments so far and let him know that _Six Pixels of Separation_ was next on my list. I laughed politely when he told me that _Six Pixels_ was the kind of book you would read, highlight, write in and reference for years to come. (I think a lot of authors would like to think that.) Having now completed the book I’m chagrined again, this time at having skepticism in his comment. He was absolutely right – _Six Pixels of Separation_ is so chock full of resources, checklists and references that I can guarantee it will be close at hand for years to come.

Joel is a marketer and an entrepreneur. Not surprising then, this is a book written for entrepreneurs, focusing on the power and “how-tos” of marketing in the online world. Joel uses specific and personal examples to teach the most un-tech savvy of us how to play and prosper in social media. Even if you have no interest or intention of being present online (a bad idea, if you were to ask Joel), _Six Pixels of Separation_ has some valuable life lessons we can all learn from and adopt.
