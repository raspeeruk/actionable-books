  ### The Three Imperatives


  > "The difference between the small giants and everyone else lies in their
  refusal to let go of the passion and their success in keeping it alive."-
  Small Giants, page 199


  Perhaps one of the benefits of easing up on the “growth for growth’s sake”
  mentality, is that it opens your mind to other methods of measuring success.
  For the 14 companies in Burlingham’s case study set, the measuring stick
  became quality. All 14 of these companies have become synonymous with
  excellence. As far as Burlingham has been able to identify, there are three
  broad “imperatives” that were unanimously true within the culture of each
  organization; imperatives that, when adhered to, allowed for that
  exceptionally high standard. Tellingly, all three of those imperatives have to
  do with employee interaction:


  1.  **Share a Higher Purpose.** The leaders of these “Small Giant” companies
  constantly and consistently remind their employees of their overarching
  mission; their purpose for being. The mission is different for each
  organization, of course, but in all cases it rises above and beyond profits.
  Profits become a way to fuel the mission, not the ultimate end objective.

  2.  **Remind people in unexpected ways how much the company cares for them.**
  Whether it’s through education funds, exceptionally generous benefits, or
  allowing single moms to bring their kids to work, the companies studied in
  _Small Giants_ go out of their way to make it known to their employees how
  much they (a) appreciate them, and (b) respect them. Keep in mind these are
  **small** businesses. They don’t have limitless cash. They do, however,
  understand the importance of their people… and they let them know.

  3.  **Build a culture of collegiality.** As Burlingham is quick to admit, at
  first glance it may not seem that you as a leader have much control over how
  well your employees get along. And yet, the leaders of these small giants have
  been able to do just that. Whether it’s creating policies that help people
  feel more secure in their roles, creating opportunities for growth within the
  organization, or simply making sure everyone feels heard, the small giant
  leaders keep their finger on the pulse, so to speak, around the culture of
  collegiality.


  Three imperatives, the summation of which create a culture in which employees
  genuinely care about the success of the business. The good news is, we can all
  create such environments. It’s not easy, but it is possible. Here are a couple
  tips to get you started.

  ### What's the Focus?


  > "‘We wanted to raise the bar,’ he said. ‘Instead of trying to do it all, we
  wanted to be the best at a few things. We physically gave up our licenses in
  other states so we couldn't work there, and we went from taking every job to
  questioning every job.’"- Bill Butler, Butler Construction, quoted in Small
  Giants, page 39


  In the case of all small giants, once they got to the cash-flow positive
  point, the focus became something other than growth. For some it was quality.
  For others it was staying in a certain geographic region, or certain hours.
  For Bill Butler, the motivation was to keep his head count below 150. He
  wanted to know the names of everyone in the company, and didn’t think he could
  manage that with more than 150 employees. This motivation forced Butler to be
  selective on which clients he worked with. The “exclusivity factor” (and
  subsequently the ability to charge more) was the **result** of following a
  different motivation, and not the original purpose.

  ### Be Unprofessional


  > "Though \[small giant leaders\] were consummate businesspeople, they were
  anything but professional managers. Indeed, they were the opposite of
  professional managers. They had deep emotional attachments to the business, to
  the people who worked in it, and to its customers and suppliers - the sort of
  feelings that are the bane of professional management."- Small Giants, page
  xxxi


  I find it sad that “professional” has somehow become synonymous with
  “detached”. Aloof and calculating may have worked well for Gordon Gecko in
  _Wallstreet_, but it doesn’t work in small business. Leaders of Small Giant
  companies care. Passionately and deeply, they care. They care about their
  people, their product, their clients, their community, etc. They genuinely,
  deeply care, and they’re comfortable showing it. Yes, it opens them up to the
  risk of pain and rejection. It also attracts employees, clients and fans.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are many lessons and takeaways from _Small Giants_, but ultimately I
  think the biggest value for me was in the inspiration this book provided.
  Burlingham has identified hundreds (if not thousands) of businesses that have
  chosen greatness over size; purpose over profits. The irony of course being
  that all of the companies studied realize excellent profits compared to their
  peers. These companies have soul (or what Burlingham refers to as “mojo”), and
  they are an inspiration for the rest of us.

  "...there are libraries of books, reams of articles, and endless videos and
  tapes on how to create a motivated workforce, but if you want to see examples
  of businesses that have cracked the code, so to speak, you need look no
  further than the small giants."

There’s a point in every small business’s lifespan when, so long as they survive, they are faced with the decision of how fast to grow, and to what end. For some entrepreneurs, the idea of an IPO or Acquisition is **the** reason for starting the business in the first place. _Small Giants_ is not a book for these entrepreneurs.

In the words of _The_ _Washington Post_‘s, Steve Pearlstein, “Bo Burlingham’s done for private companies what Jim Collins did for public companies in [_Good to Great_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/good-to-great/)_._ Which is to say that from atop his perch as Editor at Large of _Inc. Magazine_, Burlingham set out to codify what makes certain small businesses (less than $350 million) exceptional, virtually in every way. The companies, these “small giants”, as Burlingham has labelled them, provide exceptional quality. They engage exceptional employees who, in turn, provide exceptional customer service. These companies have particularly strong ties to their communities, rabidly loyal employees and customers that rave about them. And while every one of the companies studied can be safely labelled “successful”, many of them are **actively avoiding** growth, whether that entails turning down new clients, or refusing to expand geographically.

_Small Giants_ is a book about questioning the “growth for growth’s sake” mentality in business, and examining what really makes a privately held company “great”.
