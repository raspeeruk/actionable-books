  ### Creating Smart Habits and Changing Behavior


  > "The mind is designed to think as little as possible. Habits are created by
  consistent mapping and repetition. Habit change requires replacing bad habits
  with good ones."- Smart Thinking, page 27


  Okay, repeat after me, “Duh!” Of course what the author says above is obvious.
  However, evaluate your own success in regards to changing a deeply entrenched
  habit you are unhappy with. There are gaps between knowledge and application
  of that knowledge when it comes to forming new habits. We need to understand
  that our mind is always on the look out to create habits and that most of
  those habits are, in fact, good ones because they allow us to perform crucial
  actions in our daily lives without thinking about them.


  **To engage in ‘smart thinking’, we have to become more acutely aware of our
  environment and the desirable behaviors that will support smart habit
  creation.** To create habit change, there are two things that must happen.
  First and most obvious is to find ways to stop engaging in the old,
  undesirable behavior. The second and most critical to change is to replace the
  bad habit with a good one.

  ### Smart Thinking in Practice


  > "By adding elements to your environment that remind you of actions that you
  are supposed to perform, you are providing a framework or scaffold to support
  your new behaviors."- Smart Thinking, page 187


  Slow down. Think. REALLY think before you act. **I’m not your mother, but
  remember effective learning requires a process to think more deeply.** By
  talking to yourself as you are learning something new and walking through new
  concepts around the higher-level knowledge, you allow your brain to flex its
  associative muscles and make patterns of understanding that will lead to smart
  thinking.


  When you are in a situation of new learning and challenged with understanding
  knowledge unfamiliar to you, it helps to create a summary of the experience
  before moving on to the next thing. Few people do this. You should. Stop.
  Structure your new learning by taking notes and write a summary of what you
  think you need to understand for the long term and isolate the key points
  (_can you say “Actionable Books Summary”?!_).


  This will create high-quality knowledge that you will be able to apply more
  readily when a situation comes up that requires smart thinking. Your (written)
  summary should organize around three elements: **objects** (people),
  **events**, and **casual understanding**. Casual understanding is organized
  around explanations and is always related to a particular _why_ question. When
  you understand the reasons behind the acquisition of this new learning
  experience, then you will be able to use that information to determine its
  application towards your desired outcome.


  _Smart Thinking_ is presented in a simple, readable fashion that encourages
  taking action to arrive at a better understanding of our good and troubled
  habits, and then provides new strategies to serve new, more beneficial
  outcomes in your personal and business life. The information in the book could
  be a life-altering experience for many readers. On the surface, the
  discussions of cognitive science and behavior modification seem somewhat
  obvious and straightforward. However, based upon my own experiences in the
  weeks after finishing the book, I was making ‘connections in search of
  meaning’ and had the sense of being more creative when looking at the
  opportunities and struggles inside my business.


  One brief example: Upon finishing the book, I came up with a unique and
  different way of approaching my Monday-Friday work schedule. I created a
  highly personalized approach to moving distraction-riddled behaviors into a
  new schedule that addressed the trigger situations that created the bad habit
  and inefficient thinking. I engaged in the smart thinking process, quite
  literally. I am three weeks into this new schedule and I am demonstrably more
  productive and creative in my work.


  How could replacing bad habits with good ones change your life?

  ### The Formula for Smart Habits


  > "There is a formula for Smart Habits, which requires only two ingredients:
  1. Mapping between an action and the environment consistently and 2.
  Performing that action repeatedly."- Smart Thinking, page 33


  **There is hope.** You can perform _desirable_ behaviors _automatically_. The
  first part of forming a smart habit is creating consistent mapping, which is
  making a connection between the environment and a behavior. We need to slow
  down and be cognizant of the outside world _and_ our internal mental feelings
  and thoughts. Consciously and slowly recognizing an environment that brings a
  bad habit into presence is the first key to habit change. Then, when engaging
  in the new, desired habit, a ‘new map’ between the environment and action is
  created. Repeating that action in that environment will result in a new habit
  forming.


  **Surprisingly, you do not need massive amounts of willpower to create new
  habits intentionally** (and this is backed up by the most recent studies in
  cognitive psychology). These new habits can develop as long as you
  consistently map your physical _and_ mental environment _to_ the behavior you
  desire to carry out. By slowing down and thinking about this linking of
  environment and behavior, you engage the frontal lobes of your brain that can
  empower you from not carrying out the undesired habit. In other words, be
  mindful about the unwanted habit and your environment, and you have the clues
  to begin to remove them.

Sigh. We know we have accumulated plenty of bad habits over the years but the question always thrust upon us at the beginning of a new year is: **What can we do to eradicate the habits we know are holding us back from reaching a higher level of accomplishment and personal fulfillment?**

_Smart Thinking_ provides a simple framework to understand how memory and experience work while providing methods to implement specific strategies that will enable deliberate, helpful changes to improve our effectiveness. Author Art Markman utilizes his years in cognitive psychology to “replace self-limiting habits with those that foster ‘**_smart thinking_**_’”_. ‘Smart Thinking’ simply means: do more, better. It is the ability to solve new problems using one’s current knowledge, and the good news is that it is a skill that one can develop.

**So how do we rid ourselves of muddled thinking and destructive patterns of behavior?** Markman presents three key areas that we need to be in control of in order to engage in ‘smart thinking’: **smart habits**, **high-quality knowledge,** and **the** **application of that high-quality knowledge**. The fact is that most of what we do every day, we do without thinking – but that’s not a bad thing because the brain is designed to focus on the easiest, safest solutions to any problem without the heavy lifting of slow, ponderous thought patterns. However, Markman believes that we need to organize our life so that the things we do by habit are actions that will promote ‘smarter behavior’. **This means we have to work harder at thinking about what we do as we do it.**
