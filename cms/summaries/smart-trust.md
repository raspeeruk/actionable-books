  ### Trust Changes Prosperity, Energy, and Joy


  > "He studied how other banks set up their loan operation, and then he set up
  a bank, the Grameen Bank, that did the exact opposite ... Contrary to almost
  everyone's expectations, an amazing 98 percent of Grameen Bank borrowers do
  pay back their loans ... \[T\]o date the organization has made more than $6
  billion in loans to more than 8 million borrowers."- Smart Trust, pages 7-8


  Distrust slows processes. It requires more paperwork, more checks and
  balances, more conversations, more people, more time. Businesses working in a
  **low-trust environment** incur a tax. **Everything they do costs more.**


  Trust not only eliminates that tax, it acts as a **performance multiplier.**
  Two studies quoted by Covey and Link found that high-trust organizations
  outperformed low-trust organizations and the market in general by almost three
  times.


  High-trust relationships **amplify the engagement and innovation** of all
  involved. Worrying less about hidden agendas frees the players to dig in and
  do the work. A chart showing the relationship between trust and happiness
  within countries shows a tight connection: higher trust brings greater
  happiness.


  Trust is the difference between **happiness**, success, progress, and
  stagnation and **misery**.

  ### Take the 5 Actions of Smart Trust


  > "\[F\]ive specific actions that, remarkably, an incredibly diverse variety
  of high-trust individuals, teams, and organizations from all over the world
  have in common."- Smart Trust, page 83


  Covey and Link continue the tried-and-true method of giving us a list, a
  process, an overview of **practical steps** to improve **our own quality of
  trust** while simultaneously **planting seeds** of trust’s benefits in the
  lives of those around us. They call these “The 5 Actions of Smart Trust.”


  **1\. Choose to believe in trust** – The greatest benefit of smart trust is
  that it isn’t credulity, blind trust. It allows us to have **reasons to
  believe in the practical value** of trust, to extend it to others, and to act
  in a trustworthy manner without undue concern about being taken advantage of.
  Believing in trust also means believing that most people are basically
  trustworthy. Again, smart trust shows us how to extend that trust with a
  **minimal downside,** growing our propensity to trust bit by bit rather than
  requiring huge leaps of faith. When we understand the principles of smart
  trust, it is the obvious choice for leaders.


  **2\. Start with yourself** – Trust yourself. **Self-doubt can be managed with
  smart trust principles.** Give others a person they can trust. (This leads
  into the next two actions.)


  **3\. Declare your intent, and assume positive intent in others** – Make it
  obvious to others what you’re going to do, and why. **We all have an agenda.
  Make yours public** and others will see that your words and actions are
  aligned. Trust can’t be earned by invisible actions. Assuming positive intent
  in others has been shown to be key in creating trustworthy behavior in others.


  **4\. Do what you say you’re going to do** – Obvious, yes? Then why is it so
  rare? There are four options in the “say/do” matrix. Underpromising and
  underdelivering causes a **gradual erosion** of trust. Overpromising but
  underdelivering is the obvious **trust-destroying** action. “Underpromise, but
  overdeliver” is a common business mantra, yet it leads to **very slow** trust
  growth. It’s also a great way to be invisible. When we **promise to achieve
  the minimum, nobody cares.** The final option, promise and deliver (in the
  best case, overdeliver) results in **the greatest leaps in trust.** Big
  promises stand out more than little ones. When we deliver, even overdeliver on
  those big promises, we enter the rarified air of world-class trust.


  **5\. Lead out in extending trust to others** – Leaders, by definition, go
  first. Extending smart trust to others produces **tangible results.** It
  increases trust, because we’ve created it when we extend it, and because it
  **leads to reciprocity.** Yes, extending trust involves risk. Multiple
  examples in the book show that the risks are usually **less than we’d think.**
  Zappos’ 365-day guarantee has resulted in increased business, not abuse and
  loss. Zane’s Cycles, one of the largest bicycle stores in the US, lets any
  customer take a bicycle for a test ride without asking for identification or
  collateral. Hot prospect for bike thieves, right? They’re almost begging you
  to steal the bike. Actual losses amount to **5 bicycles stolen per year,
  compared to 5,000 sold.** If a $13 million business can extend trust, we can,
  too.

  ### Balance Propensity to Trust with Analysis


  > "Smart trust… optimizes two key factors: (1) a propensity to trust and (2)
  analysis."- Smart Trust, page 57


  You’ve known both types: the **gullible** trusting sort who’s always taken
  advantage of, and the **paranoiac** misanthrope who has their own mother sign
  a receipt. Most of us fall somewhere in between, with a strong leaning toward
  one or the other.


  Smart trust is **not about balance,** trusting enough but not too much. It is
  about **trusting just as much as possible,** while keeping an eye on the
  downside.


  Getting the analysis right is the trick. Covey shows us three areas to
  analyze: **opportunity, risk, and credibility.** How great is the opportunity?
  Some outcomes are so worthwhile they warrant the risks which are necessary to
  get there. Other times, the risks are so great that no outcome validates them.


  **Risk** is where this often falls apart. Covey and Link tell two brief
  stories: one, about the commander of a nuclear sub who pointed out that they
  had regulations about everything right down to using the bathroom. Nobody was
  about to change that, because if something goes wrong on a nuclear sub, the
  outcome can be a world-class disaster. On the other hand, newspaper companies
  accept the risk that when someone drops a quarter in the machine, they just
  might take two papers instead of one. Newspapers probably recycle more than is
  stolen. Low-risk, that. So in your analysis, ask yourself, are we talking
  about **nukes or newspapers?**


  When the other party has credibility, that combination of **character and
  competence,** it intrinsically lowers the risks.


  For those of us who tend to trust first and ask questions later, learning this
  type of analysis is a practical tool. For those who have a low propensity to
  trust, the lesson is that **we learn to trust by trusting.** Monitor your
  analysis, and balance the risks and opportunity. Weigh in the credibility of
  the other party. Begin with low-risk situations. Extend trust, even though
  it’s uncomfortable. As you realize more opportunities, others’ credibility
  will grow, as will your propensity to trust.
f_conclusion: >-
  Trust is a very personal concept in my life. Born in a rural area of northern
  Wisconsin, I grew up in a home where **we intentionally left our doors
  unlocked** when we left home, in case a passing motorist broke down and needed
  shelter from life-threatening weather. We loaned things just because we were
  asked. We believed what we were told.

Would you loan me $20?

Unless you know me personally, probably not.

When you buy a book at Amazon.com, do you take the great deal offered by BrandNewSeller#37 and get a “like new” used copy for half price, or do you pay full price to get it from Amazon?

Take a look at Transparency International’s [Corruption Perceptions Index](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/). Chart the gross domestic product of each nation, and note the near-perfect **correlation between trust to prosperity,** worldwide.

From individuals to companies to entire nations, trust affects not only how we do business, but how much business we do. **If we are perceived to be trustworthy, business is streamlined.** There’s less muss and fuss when both players trust. Warren Buffett has closed multimillion dollar deals on, literally, a handshake, because there was trust on both sides.

Introduced in his first book _The Speed of Trust,_ Covey’s concept of “smart trust” aims to help us find a human and rational balance between our **innate desire to trust** and our **learned fear** of being taken for a ride and then asked to pay the fare.

Trust is a very personal concept in my life. Born in a rural area of northern Wisconsin, I grew up in a home where **we intentionally left our doors unlocked** when we left home, in case a passing motorist broke down and needed shelter from life-threatening weather. We loaned things just because we were asked. We believed what we were told.

As I grew up, **I extended trust, but without analysis.** Over time, experiences shifted me from “a high propensity to trust” to downright cynical. A decade ago I decided that was no way to live, and started my own quest for smart trust, though I didn’t have that term back then. Covey and Link’s books, both _Smart Trust_ and _The Speed of Trust_, would have been a godsend 10 years ago. At least now I have the **terminology**, the **science**, and the **evidence** for smart trust.

It’s a **happier** way to live. It’s a more **productive** way to live.

How’s your **propensity to trust?** How do you balance it with **analysis?**

**Are you practicing smart trust?**
