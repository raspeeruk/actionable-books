  ### The hard way, the cheap way or the smart way?


  > "Too many of us place our hopes and dreams in the unreliable hands of luck,
  but the world’s most rapidly successful people take luck into their own
  hands..."- Smartcuts, page 14


  Does this classic success advice sound familiar? Work hard, believe you can do
  it, visualize and push yourself harder than anyone else. This is the hard way.
  Or maybe you’ve been schooled with other common success advice. Outsource the
  tough stuff, and try to profit from the arbitrage. This is the cheap way.
  Shane teaches us the smart way. He claims that the fastest route to success is
  never traditional and that anyone can speed up progress with the following
  nine principles.


  1.  **Hacking the ladder:** Approach a problem laterally. Companies that
  pivot, switch business models or products while on the upward swing, perform
  better.

  2.  **Training with masters:** Learn from those who have gone before you.

  3.  **Rapid feedback:** Use failure to push yourself forward.

  4.  **Platforms:** Find the ‘paved roads’. Build on top of things that already
  exist.

  5.  **Catching waves:** Like a surfer who watches the waves for just the right
  one, watch the horizon to see what trend is coming and jump on.

  6.  **Superconnecting:** Build a powerful network and be generous in serving
  them.

  7.  **Momentum:** Break the challenge into smaller tasks so you can feed off
  the energy of the small step wins.

  8.  **Simplicity:** Eliminate the clutter so your hard practice is focused and
  targeted.

  9.  **10X thinking:** Have a noble big vision.

  ### Superconnectors – you just might be the catalyst to something big!


  > "No matter the medium or the method, giving is the timeless smart-cut for
  harnessing superconnectors and creating serendipity."- Smartcuts, page 138


  The most successful people in any industry are extremely generous. Adam
  Grant’s research proves this. (Enjoy the summary of his book _Give and Take_
  [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/give-and-take/).) But don’t
  worry, this generosity doesn’t need to involve huge acts of sacrifice. The
  generosity simply comes from a focus on acting in the interests of others,
  such as by giving help, providing mentoring, sharing credit, or making
  connections for others.


  A friend of mine lost her job this week. In fact her entire sales team lost
  their jobs. She sent me a note describing her colleagues and what a great team
  they were and how they could just be the best thing a growing company came
  across. She extolled the virtues of her peers and that yes, by the way, she
  would also be looking for a job.


  I was impressed by her act of generosity and I know she will succeed. Contrast
  that to her peer, who when my friend called him about the openings she found
  advertised in his part of the country, pleaded “don’t tell the others”. Having
  a mindset of abundance will feed your generosity whereas a mindset of scarcity
  starves it.

  ### Momentum – success breeds success


  > "…momentum – not experience – is the single biggest predictor of business
  and personal success."- Smartcuts, page 13


  Only one third of Americans are happy in their jobs. Why do you think that is?
  What affects your happiness most dramatically? The answer was deduced from
  Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile from her study of 238
  white-collar workers. It is simply progress; a sense of forward motion;
  regardless of how small.


  Do you remember the story from Greek mythology about Sisyphus? As the story
  goes, as punishment for chronic deceitfulness Sisyphus was condemned to push a
  rock up a mountain. Upon reaching the top, the rock would roll down again,
  leaving him to start over.


  Yesterday I wasn’t happy with my work-day. I had spent days preparing to shoot
  an educational video. Finally, with minutes remaining before the kids would
  come clamoring home from school, I did it! I shot the perfect take. Progress!
  And then discovered the memory card was full and it wasn’t captured. All those
  hours of work down the drain.


  Are your happiest days when you see progress, regardless of how small? So make
  your days (or your team members’ days) happier by setting up lots of tiny
  wins. When I teach how to influence behavior change, for example, we break the
  influence into five steps. Ascending the “staircase of behavior change” by
  merely one step is cause for celebration. It makes a huge difference for
  people. Instead of saying “we failed” when the person doesn’t change a
  behavior, they can say “We saw progress”. The person moved up one step! It
  makes the world of difference in their momentum to make the next call. Success
  breeds success. How can you set up more wins in your day?

  Shane Snow shares nine smartcuts to help us improve our lives and careers.
  What conventions do you need to reject to work smarter. What mindsets do you
  need to alter? What smartcuts do you need to add? To have the breakthrough
  change you desire, maybe you need to break some of the rules.

> "…the fastest route to success is never traditional…" _\- Smartcuts, page 6_

Imagine you are driving in a storm. Between the furor of the windshield wipers, you make out the figures of three people waving you down. You cautiously slow down and realize that one of them is a frail old woman, who looks on the verge of collapse. Another one is a friend who once saved your life. The third is the romantic interest of your dreams, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to meet him or her. You have only one other seat in the car. You have to choose. It’s a tough one. There is good reason to choose any one of them.

Who do you pick up?

The old woman of course. Then give the car keys to your friend and stay behind with the romantic interest to wait for the bus!

And this is the kind of lateral thinking that Shane Snow says overachievers have used throughout history. The world’s biggest successes have resulted from people who refused to follow the expected course and rather buck the norm. _Smartcuts_ is about bucking the norm.

In _Smartcuts_, Shane Snow shares his discoveries of what people and businesses do that achieve rapid success and breakthrough innovations. He catalogues their patterns and culls them down to nine principles. These nine principles comprise a framework for breaking convention and explain how successful people do more with less.

He admits, however, that the one irreplaceable ingredient is work. This book is not for people who are averse to hard work. Rather he tells edge-of-your-seat stories of successful people who didn’t want their hard work to end up in vain. He then illuminates the patterns that led to their success. Lateral thinking, he says, doesn’t replace hard work; it eliminates unnecessary cycles.
