  ### Rock, Paper, Scissors


  > "The future isn’t one thing. Rather it is a multitude of possibilities that
  often contradict one another until one of them comes true."- Smarter Faster
  Better, page 179


  I think the short answer is that thinking is hard work. It’s hard because for
  many situations in life, there is not one right ‘answer’ or solution. And our
  school system has trained us (inadvertently perhaps?) to seek out the ‘right’
  answer and so we are reluctant to be wrong. As Duhigg points out, the future
  is _a multitude of possibilities_. And the larger the number of possibilities,
  the harder it becomes to sort out which solution is the right one for us.
  While we can never predict the future with 100% accuracy, the good news is we
  can improve our chances.


  Statistics always boggled my mind in university and yet I was fascinated by
  the research Duhigg presents on probabilistic thinking and patterning (often
  referred to as Bayesian cognition). Apparently humans frequently rely on
  mental forecasting to aid our decision-making even when we have very little
  data to go on. What really astounded me is that research has shown we are
  surprisingly accurate with many of our ‘predictions’ without needing to think
  about them too hard. We rely a lot on our lived experience and our
  observations of past events when considering possible outcomes and over time
  our instincts become quite good – so long as our base assumptions are correct.


  My big ah-ha? If you want to make smarter, faster, better decisions, you’ll
  need to strengthen your Bayesian thinking muscles!

  ### Master the Art of Chunking


  > "One way to overcome information blindness is to force ourselves to grapple
  with the data in front of us, to manipulate information by transforming it
  into a sequence of questions to be answered or choices to be made."- Smarter
  Faster Better, page 246


  Duhigg describes ‘information blindness’ as _“our mind’s tendency to stop
  absorbing data when there is too much to take in.”_ While it is important to
  consider multiple scenarios before making a decision, we do risk overwhelming
  ourselves with too much information which results in indecision instead of
  clarity. In business this is often referred to as analysis paralysis.


  Duhigg notes that when we become overwhelmed by the data surrounding a
  decision, our brains automatically pivot to a more binary decision – “_Do I
  try to make sense of all this information or just ignore it?”_ Knowing that
  binary choices simplify decision-making provides us with a strategy for moving
  out of analysis paralysis – data chunking.


  Let’s say you walk into an ice cream parlour that offers fifty different
  flavours of ice cream. How will you choose which one to order? You can
  simplify the decision by breaking it down into multiple smaller decisions that
  are easier to make. Do I want ice cream or gelato? Something new or familiar?
  Tart or creamy? Cone or bowl? One scoop or two?


  For low risk decisions like ice cream, we do this fairly quickly and without a
  lot of thought or debate. For higher-risk decisions (like buying a car,
  choosing a university, selecting investments) we will progress more slowly and
  thoughtfully, influenced by how we choose to organize and manipulate the
  information as well as our values and priorities. Interacting with the data in
  some way is critical; it’s less about the tool (calculator vs spreadsheet) and
  more about creating smaller, easily managed data chunks.


  So the next time you are faced with a decision that involves processing a lot
  of information, try asking yourself a series of binary questions. Not only
  will it help you organize that information into more manageable information
  chunks, it will shrink the perceived risk associated with each decision point.
  Will that be a waffle or sugar cone?

  ### Always Consider Multiple Outcomes


  > "To become better at predicting the future – at making good decisions – we
  need to know the difference between what we hope will happen and what is more
  and less likely to occur."- Smarter Faster Better, page 180


  I’ve lost many a chess game because I was too focused on what I hoped a
  particular move would cause my opponent to do rather than thoroughly
  considering all the possible counter-moves. We may think we approach
  decision-making in a calm, collected, rational manner, yet if we were honest
  with ourselves we would acknowledge that in the final moment, it is our
  _emotions_ not our logic that heavily influence our choices. We usually go
  with what **_feels_** right and pay more attention to facts (and assumptions)
  that support our emotional decision.


  Successful people have developed habits that help them make decisions more
  effectively. Specifically, they:


  *   work at managing their emotions,

  *   reflect on and analyze failures as well as successes,

  *   constantly question and update their assumptions, and

  *   envision multiple futures and outcomes.


  Oh, and they do one other thing better than most people. They make peace with
  uncertainty, knowing that over time the odds will be tilted in their favour.
  With practice, you too can leverage the power of probability to improve your
  decision-making outcomes.

> "We’ve been staring at the tools of productivity – the gadgets and apps and complicated filing systems for keeping track of various to-do lists – rather than the lessons those technologies are trying to teach us." _\- Smarter Faster Better, page 8_

As a trainer, I see it all the time. People attend a workshop looking for that one tool or tip that will simplify their life, solve their problems and improve their chances of success. I’m pretty confident we read business books (and you’re reading this Actionable summary) for the same reasons – a desire to find some shortcut to doing things _smarter, faster, better._ I’m not throwing stones in a glass house, I do it too! And, apparently investigative reporter and author Charles Duhigg shares this universal human desire as well.

What I’ve learned over time, and what Duhigg underscores in this book, is that while tools, gadgets, systems and apps provide a structure for productivity and goal achievement, the real work occurs between our ears and cannot be avoided or side-stepped. Fellow Actionable Book Club member Ronni Hendel-Giller’s summary of [_Smarter Faster Better_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/smarter-faster-better/) noted the book is not a compilation of tips and strategies, as much as an exploration of the lessons that underpin productivity at a holistic level. I agree. When you understand the science behind why people do what they do, you appreciate the power that comes from shifting one’s internal thinking processes first instead of latching onto the latest productivity app or system.

So why are we so focused on finding the right tool rather than developing our thinking abilities?
