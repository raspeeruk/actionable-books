  ### Productivity is About Choices


  > "Productivity is about recognizing choices that other people often overlook.
  It’s about making certain decisions in certain ways. The way we choose to see
  our own lives; the stories we tell ourselves and the goals we push ourselves
  to spell out in detail; the culture we establish among teammates; the ways we
  frame our choices and manage the information in our lives."- Smarter Better
  Faster, location 4360


  In a book with so many disparate topics—many of which are seemingly
  disconnected from one another—the thread that sits behind all of them is that
  we make choices—all the time. Productivity isn’t only about how we use our
  time, it’s about how we approach our work and our lives—alone and together.
  It’s about who we bring in and how we engage them. It’s about how we frame our
  decisions—and it’s about our mindsets as we work and live.


  Productivity isn’t, as we might think, about efficiency. In fact, there is
  waste and there is messiness. Productivity, according to Duhigg, is about
  thinking differently.


  For me, this opens up ways of thinking about how I work and live that I hadn’t
  considered before and new ways to define and measure my productivity.

  ### The How of Teams vs. the Who of Teams


  > "The right norms could raise the collective intelligence of mediocre
  thinkers. The wrong norms could hobble a group made up of people who, on their
  own, were all exceptionally bright."- Smarter Faster Better, location 951


  I found the chapter on teams to be the most intriguing in Duhigg’s book with
  both surprising and quite practical implications. We learn about Google’s
  People Analytics team’s quest to understand why some teams perform better than
  others. After analyzing a trove of data, the team finds itself unable to
  identify patterns that would correlate anything about a team’s composition
  with its success. Bottom line, who was on a team didn’t seem to matter.


  So, what did matter? The answer was the groups norms—how they operated—not who
  they were. In strong teams, norms were established that created psychological
  safety. Healthy teams of nurses, for example, were those who had permission to
  report mistakes. Norms that exemplified strong teams created a “sense of
  togetherness while also encouraging people to take a chance.”


  A team of “mediocre thinkers” might display more collective intelligence with
  the right group norms than a team of exceptionally bright people who were not
  psychologically safe in their team.


  One particularly interesting measure of psychological safety that also
  provides a practical way to assess a team is that members of strong teams
  speak in pretty much equal proportion. If one person or a small sub-set speak
  all the time, collective intelligence drops. “The conversations didn’t need to
  be equal every minute, but in aggregate, they had to balance out.”


  So, great teams, from the outside, might look loud and messy, with people
  speaking over one another—going off on tangents. Less productive teams could
  look efficient—quiet, with no one interrupting anyone. Those “efficient” teams
  are likely still made up of individuals acting individually, whereas the messy
  team is more likely to be one in which people are speaking as much as they
  need and are attuned to one another. And, they are much more productive.

  ### Setting Goals—SMART is Not Sufficient


  > "If you’re being constantly told to focus on achievable results, you’re only
  going to think of achievable goals."- Smarter Faster Better, location 1938


  We often talk about setting SMART goals. The problem is—that’s not enough. I
  love my to-do lists—and Duhigg points out why that’s not always serving me.
  Our brains get enormous satisfaction when we check items off the lists—when we
  get closure. At the end of the day, however, we may not be doing what matters
  most. The satisfaction of cleaning out our inbox can be enormous—except the
  result is that we didn’t write the article that was significantly more
  important. At the end of the day we can tick a bunch of items off our list
  (and feel great in the moment)—but not move to our important goals.


  On the other hand, stretch goals aren’t sufficient either. Without a way to
  get them done—we are unlikely to achieve them. The tasks that create closure
  will win out over the big stretchy goals.


  So, the answer is to create stretch goals that are supported by SMART goals
  (or any other method to break down the stretch goal—SMART isn’t the only way.)
  Every task is in service of a large ambition—the tasks, taken together, result
  in achieving the greater goal or ambition. When we write down the goals
  together with the tasks that support them, we literally keep our eye on what
  really matters as we check off the steps to get there.


  I’m starting my months, weeks and days now by thinking about what I really
  want to accomplish—what matters most—and then putting my lists together more
  consciously in service of those bigger ambitions. And, I’m working harder to
  keep the larger goal top of mind as I work on the tasks that will get me
  there—rather than spend my day focused exclusively on the tasks and items on
  my list.

  It was hard to choose two Insights to share here—as each chapter is built
  around a insight related to its particular topic. Many of them are easy to
  incorporate into daily life—others are ways of operating differently in groups
  and teams. All are useful.

> "Productivity, put simply, is the name we give our attempts to figure out the best uses of our energy, intellect, and time as we try to seize the most meaningful rewards with the least wasted effort." _\- Smarter Faster Better, location 80_

Unlike many books on productivity, _Smarter Faster Better_ is not a book of tips or systems to become more efficient. Instead, Duhigg looks at productivity holistically. How do we make the most of our lives? The topics he explores include creating focus, setting goals, working in teams, managing others, making decisions, innovating and absorbing data. Each topic—or chapter—is rich with stories, data and insights. And, while some of what he shares is familiar, there’s enough that’s new—and that provides a unique and counterintuitive perspective—to be interesting and provocative. And, the book is quite actionable.

Duhigg is a terrific journalist and writer. This is a fun and engaging book to read—so even if there’s a topic or chapter that you might not initially think applies to you—you’ll probably enjoy reading it and walk away with a valuable insight nonetheless.

It was hard to choose two Insights to share here—as each chapter is built around a insight related to its particular topic. Many of them are easy to incorporate into daily life—others are ways of operating differently in groups and teams. All are useful.

The last part of the book is a description of how the author has taken the various Insights and incorporated them into his daily life and routines. It’s a helpful review—and reminds you of just how practical the book is and how easily you can adopt its findings in your life. I encourage you to read to the end!
