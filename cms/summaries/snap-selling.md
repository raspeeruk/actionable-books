  ### SNAP Factors


  > "Your ability to stay in the Go Zone - where you’re still a player and have
  a chance of getting the customer’s business – is highly contingent on your
  ability to successfully leverage the SNAP factors."- SNAP Selling, page 23


  _SNAP_ is the framework that Konrath uses to describe how sellers can stay in
  front of today’s frazzled customers. It stands for:


  Simple  

  iNvaluable  

  Aligned  

  Priority


  Let’s start with **Simple**. People simply can’t stand to add more complexity
  to their lives. Management is fighting fires and managers are simply trying to
  stay afloat with all the projects they’ve been assigned. Even a small
  perceived complexity can scare away a customer. Keeping the messages simple
  without the fluffy marketing lingo will help keep things crystal clear in the
  eyes of the customers. Today’s buyers have no time for sellers that only have
  a “skin deep” understanding of the issues that their customers face. Buyers
  are expecting sellers to know their issues better than ever before and only
  those who can bring **iNvaluable** insights to the conversation. A seller that
  also waits for direction from the buyer will be written off as someone who
  does not have the experience or expertise. **Aligned** is the most important
  of the SNAP factors. In the customer’s mind, you’re either aligned or not. If
  your vision is not aligned to the company or individual’s mission, you’re not
  going to get in the door. Buyers will also be turned off immediately if the
  seller goes straight into explaining their offerings or shares customer case
  stories/studies that do not directly relate to them. Finally, let’s talk about
  **Priority**. Frazzled customers have no bandwidth for new projects that are
  not urgent. If it’s not a priority, then it’ll be tabled.


  I admit it’s a bit daunting to have to meet these factors consistently with
  every customer that sellers speak to. Besides, it takes time and research to
  understand what a customer’s priorities look like and what they see as
  relevant or irrelevant. (The challenge is exasperated when it is a prospect.)
  But the framework is a valuable start in understanding how to sell to your
  customers and stay relevant in their world.

  ### The 3 Decisions


  > "Your prospects make three very different and distinct decisions in
  relationship to working with you."- SNAP Selling, page 51


  The sales process involves three major decisions. The first decision is over
  **whether you will be allowed access**. This requires the seller to convert
  the oblivious customer to a curious customer. Your simple focus is to have
  them agree to a conversation. Being able to get to a conversation requires
  understanding the customer’s challenges, having a solid value proposition, and
  piquing their interest just enough. The second decision is about **initiative
  change**. You’re trying to help the customer go from complacent to committed.
  When customers are complacent they’re willing to listen to ideas but they’re
  not committed to making a change… yet. At this decision stage, the seller’s
  role is not to understand the needs of the customer better or to impress them
  with the products and services. The goal is to get them to understand _what is
  possible_ if they work with you and your company. Don’t get this wrong with
  “visioning” – it’s much more real than that. You need to show that you
  understand their business and sharing with them impact that you’ve been able
  to make with other companies that directly relate with their own priorities.
  The third decision is about **selecting resources**. At this stage, you’ve
  gotten your customer to open up to the possibilities and the status quo is no
  longer acceptable. Make sure to coach your champion and guide him/her through
  the process. You’ll also need to make sure that you’re also doing your best to
  influence the decision-making criteria to help your solution standout. The 3
  Decisions are a great way to break down your sales process and making sure you
  check off your list at each stage will be crucial to your success.

  ### SNAP Rules


  > "When you do figure out how to deal with frazzled customers, everything
  changes. They want to work with you. Sales cycles speed up. You have less
  competition…all at the same time."- SNAP Selling, page 31


  So let’s go deeper into the framework.


  Keeping your message simple means that you’re eliminating as many (if not all)
  the complexity in the language and process that you have when dealing with
  your customers. Find confusing language and throw it out along with complex
  steps in your sales process which might slow it down. For example, if your
  sales process requires a demonstration or sample, keep it as simple as
  possible. Don’t overwhelm the customer with all the features and
  functionalities. Stick to the ones that will help resolve the business
  challenges that you can help solve.


  Being iNvaluable is about continuously finding ways to be valuable to your
  customers. Learn about the top challenges that executives you speak with are
  dealing with or find stories of similar companies that you’ve been able to
  help. With more knowledge and expertise, you can position yourself to become
  an expert.


  To ensure alignment, make sure you are asking these questions:


  1.  How does my offering impact my customer’s primary issues and objectives?

  2.  What criteria are important to them as they make their decision?

  3.  What do they value in their working relationships?


  Staying aligned during a sales cycle means making sure you’re asking the right
  questions throughout to test the interest and commitment they have with your
  proposal. Finally, when it comes to alignment, it is important to know what
  other projects the customer is working on so you can uncover new opportunities
  and make sure you’re raising your priority ahead of others.
f_conclusion: >-
  _SNAP Selling_ is another great addition to sales “how to” books out there.
  The book is very clear with its steps and provides real scripts and talk
  tracks that you can start implementing immediately. I really liked Konrath’s
  approach because now more than ever people are crunched for time and the
  buying process is much more complex. Helping to cut the clutter for customers
  will make their lives easier and help you sell more.

> "In this book you’ll get an inside look at how your prospects actually make decisions – or don’t – in today’s crazy-busy organizations." _\- SNAP Selling, page 4_

_SNAP Selling_ is a fantastic wake-up call for sellers to step up their game to win more business in an increasingly complex world. The author, Jill Konrath, cut her teeth at Xerox and continued her amazing sales career as a sales strategist for some of the biggest companies in the world. Konrath’s book will make anybody who sells anything a little bit uncomfortable. Her “SNAP” Selling approach makes it very simple to understand how to speak to today’s frazzled customers. However, it requires sellers to step up their game and be even more relevant to their customers and prospects than ever before. Konrath’s approach to understanding your customers may be the only way that sellers will be able to keep up with the ever busy, ever confused, and ever risk-averse customers that we speak to today.
