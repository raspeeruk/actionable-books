  ### The Power of Career Capital


  > "The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming ‘so good they
  can’t ignore you’, is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital. "-
  So Good They Can’t Ignore You, page 48


  Careers that are fulfilling have the following traits:


  1.  Creativity

  2.  Impact

  3.  Control


  These factors are rare and valuable. Most jobs do not offer their employees
  great creativity, impact or control over what they do and how they do it.


  Based on the economic theory of demand and supply, in order to have a great
  career, you need something of great value to offer in return. These rare and
  valuable skills you can offer are your career capital.


  Are there strategies to systematically, reliably and quickly build career
  capital?


  Cal proposes ‘deliberate practice’ – an approach to work where you
  deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you are comfortable and then
  receive ruthless feedback on your performance.


  Musicians, athletes and chess players know about deliberate practice but most
  knowledge workers avoid the uncomfortable strain it brings, instead continuing
  with familiar tasks that do not expand their skills.


  By introducing deliberate practice strategy into their work, knowledge workers
  can accelerate past their peers in the acquisition of career capital. For
  example, Cal’s deliberate practice routine includes summarising a research
  paper weekly, indicating how it might be relevant to his research.

  ### The Power of Mission


  > "Missions are powerful because they focus your energy toward a useful goal,
  and this in turn maximises your impact on your world – a crucial factor in
  loving what you do."- So Good They Can’t Ignore You, page 152


  Like ‘control’, ‘mission’ is one of the desirable traits for a fulfilling
  career. However, it is not something that happens easily in a moment of
  inspiration.


  Cal’s research reveals the tactics for realising missions.


  1.  Missions require relevant career capital. You cannot skip straight into a
  great mission without first building mastery in your field.For example, Pardis
  Sabeti, a professor of evolutionary biology at Harvard University, found her
  mission in using computational genetics to help rid the world of ancient
  diseases after years of acquiring enough skills to recognise the exciting new
  opportunity.

  2.  However, career capital alone is not enough to make a mission a reality.
  Many people are good at what they do but have not reoriented their career in a
  compelling direction.


  2.  Missions require little bets – small and achievable projects.The best way
  to discover and realise a mission is to take small, tentative steps. This
  means deploying small, concrete experiments that return concrete feedback, and
  identifying those with the highest likelihood of leading to outstanding
  results.

  3.  Missions require marketing.For a mission-driven project to succeed, it
  should compel people to remark about it to others and be launched in a venue
  that supports such remarking.

  4.  For example, Giles Bowkett is a well-known Ruby software programmer. His
  mission is combining the worlds of the arts and Ruby programming. This mission
  was successful when he released Archaeopteryx, an open source computer
  software that writes and performs its own music, to the open-source software
  community. People took notice and spread the word.

  ### The Power of Control


  > "Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases
  their happiness, engagement and sense of fulfilment."- So Good They Can’t
  Ignore You, page 113


  Control is one of the most universally important traits that you can acquire
  with your career capital. It is so powerful and essential to the quest for
  work you love that Cal has called it the dream-job elixir.


  We need to be aware of the traps in acquiring and managing control so that it
  can work in our favour.


  **Trap #1.** Control that you acquire without career capital is not
  sustainable.


  **Trap #2.** Control generates resistance from employers. Acquiring more
  control in your working life benefits you, but likely has no direct benefit to
  your employer. They will fight your efforts to gain more autonomy.


  Both traps indicate that gaining control is not easy. When you do not have
  enough career capital, you are not in the position to pursue opportunities
  that allow you more control. But once you do have this capital, you have
  become valuable enough that your employer will resist your efforts.


  The key is to know when the time is right to be courageous in your career
  decisions.


  When deciding whether or not to pursue a bid for more autonomy, use ‘The Law
  of Financial Viability’. You should only pursue a project if people are
  willing to pay you for it. If they aren’t, you probably don’t have sufficient
  capital to exchange for the control you desire.


  The definition of ‘willing to pay’ is flexible, and may include customers
  paying you for products or services, or getting approval for a loan, receiving
  outside investment or convincing an employer to hire you with your choice of
  hours.

  Skills trump passion in the quest for work you love and pre-existing passion
  helps to sustain the journey in the acquisition of skills.

> "If you want to love what you do, abandon the passion mindset (‘what can the world offer me’) and instead adopt the craftsman mindset (‘what can I offer the world’)." _\- So Good They Can’t Ignore You, page 42_

Starting around 1970, the idea of following your passion in your career choice grew in popularity till it became the de facto advice for American career planners and seekers.

According to Cal Newton, author of _So Good They Can’t Ignore You_, this is an appealing, simple equation but should not be taken at face value because:

*   Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.

*   The vast majority of people don’t have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered and matched to a job.

In fact, following your passion can actually make it less likely to feel passionate about the work.

The passion mindset is self-focused, always asking: What is this job doing for me? Am I happy? Is there something else that I like better?

The trap of focusing on what you want causes anxiety and uncertainty. Nothing is going to measure up to the mythical idea that this is your passion and you will love it. This is harmful, leading to chronic job hopping and steering you away from a meaningful, satisfying career.

In contrast, the craftsman mindset asks: How much value am I producing? How useful am I? How can I create more positive contributions to the world?

The relentless focus on how I can make myself and my output more valuable is significantly more likely to craft a career that is a huge source of passion.

Cal observes that people are passionate about their job because they have become so good at it that they are able to choose how they want to work on it, on their own terms.

The book includes case studies of both passion and craftsman mindsets, and prompts us to examine our own approach in the search for a fulfilling career.
