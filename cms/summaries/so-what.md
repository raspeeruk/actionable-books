  ### The So What Benefit


  > "Every single time you communicate, you must ask yourself what’s important
  to your audience. Have you thought about the key points of your presentation
  from their perspective or could they be saying ‘So what?’"- So What?, page 137


  Do you know your So What Benefit? What is important to them? If you don’t
  know, Magnacca suggests you simply ask! Specifically he suggests you ask a
  member of your target audience to complete the following sentence:


  _All I really care about is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_._


  This will move you away from the logical (and less influential) ostensible
  benefit to the emotional (and more influential) So What benefit. For example,
  did you buy an iPod for its “portability” (ostensible benefit) or because you
  will have 1000 songs that you want in your pocket (So What benefit)?


  Emotion drives decision making, not logic. The So What Benefit helps you
  connect to that emotion. Move away from the benefit that seems like the reason
  people buy your product and move to the so what benefit that causes them to
  say “I love it, I want it, I’ll buy it.”

  ### It's about them, not you


  > "The quickest way to reduce nervousness is to focus on the needs of your
  audience rather than be concerned about how you look or sound in front of the
  audience."- So What?, page 136


  Sometimes we get so focused on what we have or what we want to tell them that
  we forget what they need or want. For example, people don’t go to the hardware
  store because they want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They go because they want
  to make quarter-inch holes. Are you too focused on your quarter-inch drill
  that you’ve forgotten all about what they wanted the drill for?


  If you concentrate too much on what you want to tell them, you may forget
  their needs. An antidote? Develop an inquisitive mind to discover the needs
  and a genuine interest in meeting the needs of your audience.

  ### Prepare the Soil


  > "Neil, here’s the simple reality. This game was over before it began. This
  audience made up their mind that it was not useful to listen to you even
  before you started talking. Let me tell you why."- So What?, page 57


  Does your audience or customer have a preconceived notion about who you are
  and what you do? Does that lead them to believe you might just waste their
  time? How are you preparing the soil so that your seeds or ideas can
  germinate?


  One of the ways Magnacca suggests that you can prepare the soil is to position
  yourself just like you would your product or service. Understand what is
  important to your audience and then focus on those benefits that bring meaning
  to them in the form of a personal biography. You can think of it as a document
  that answers the questions most people have before they agree to work with you
  – but are uncomfortable asking.


  While this isn’t a new idea (as far back as Napoleon Hill, the idea has been
  suggested) it has not been implemented as well as it could. In short, it
  should include:


  *   _Who you are_

  *   _Your character, competence and common ground_

  *   _What makes you unique_


  Want to make one for yourself? Magnacca offers 7 steps to help you create your
  biography and examples at sowhatbook.com.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are many ways to improve how you influence others. Magnacca offers one
  significant way that he calls the So What mindset. This will help you clarify
  your thinking and communicate what matters most to your audience. He proposes
  that if you help enough people get what they want, by showing them how what
  you have can benefit them, then you can have anything you want.

How often do you need to influence someone? Think about it. It starts the moment you wake until you lay your head back down. We influence and persuade all day long. But how much thought do you put into how you do that? How much faster, easier, more satisfying would your life be if you could influence others more effectively?

Mark Magnacca studied the communication successes and mistakes of people and companies who have changed our world and those who should have. He shares their examples with us to illustrate how the So What Question was integral to their success. All the successful influencers, he says, focused on what was important to their audience. They asked themselves ‘so what?’

He not only shares the examples, but then makes them tangible by teaching us ten ways to make them happen. His ideas help you change the way you communicate with people from ‘_here’s what I have and want_’ to ‘_here’s how you can benefit_’. The result? You learn how to engage your audience’s interest and influence them.

### The So What Benefit

> "Every single time you communicate, you must ask yourself what’s important to your audience. Have you thought about the key points of your presentation from their perspective or could they be saying ‘So what?’"- So What?, page 137

Do you know your So What Benefit? What is important to them? If you don’t know, Magnacca suggests you simply ask! Specifically he suggests you ask a member of your target audience to complete the following sentence:

_All I really care about is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_._

This will move you away from the logical (and less influential) ostensible benefit to the emotional (and more influential) So What benefit. For example, did you buy an iPod for its “portability” (ostensible benefit) or because you will have 1000 songs that you want in your pocket (So What benefit)?

Emotion drives decision making, not logic. The So What Benefit helps you connect to that emotion. Move away from the benefit that seems like the reason people buy your product and move to the so what benefit that causes them to say “I love it, I want it, I’ll buy it.”

While this sounds seductively simple, Magnacca admits it is difficult to apply. He therefore offers, as a bonus after reading the book, his 21-day challenge to reinforce the ideas, recondition your thinking and develop the So What Mindset. Brilliant!
