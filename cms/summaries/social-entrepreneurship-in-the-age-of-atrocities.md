  ### Everyone is a Change Maker


  > "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change
  the world; indeed it’s the only thing that ever has."- Margaret Meade


  The wise words of Margaret Meade have never been truer than they are today.
  Even though our world is facing a host of serious and often appalling
  challenges, the great news is we can all contribute to positive change. Often
  times the biggest barrier we face when trying to deal with social injustice is
  a lack of confidence in our abilities and potential solutions to the problems
  society struggles with.


  The first and most important step to overcoming the obstacle of insecurity is
  to give ourselves permission to look at problems objectively and realize that
  we can solve them. Giving ourselves permission to fix a problem and then
  acting on those impulses is what will ultimately change our world. With the
  amount of people that inhabit this earth, there is no way for problems to
  outnumber solutions.


  As Bill Drayton, the Founder, Chair, and CEO of _Ashkoka: Innovators for the
  Public_ says in his foreword, **“Social Entrepreneurship can be the rule, not
  the exception.”**


  This idea is best illustrated by the individuals that are profiled throughout
  the book. These individuals are neither brain surgeons nor astrophysicists but
  rather a group of committed, passionate, and often young people who saw that
  the world needed changing and gave themselves permission to come up with and
  act upon solutions.

  ### Collaboration is Key


  > "Many of the world’s problems must be addressed at the global level. Today’s
  needs, exemplified in this book by atrocities, are often so complicated and
  challenging that they demand international collaboration on solutions."-
  Social Entrepreneurship in the Age of Atrocities, page xxxv


  Society teaches us from a young age that to not only survive but to also
  thrive in our world we need to learn how to play well with others. We need to
  share and to be team players not only in order for ourselves to be successful
  but also for any project or organization we are a part of to be triumphant.


  Throughout each case study in the book, **collaboration was a trait common
  amongst all the social entrepreneurs.** Despite different backgrounds,
  different educations, and passions for different social issues, each
  entrepreneur was not only a leader but also a team player. These individuals
  knew not only how to share information with others but also how to work with
  other organizations toward achieving common goals and desired results.


  In the area of social enterprise, collaboration is essential because there are
  many organizations working toward some of the same goals. A huge number of
  these organizations compete for funding. Collaborating with these other
  organizations as well as with local governments helps to eliminate
  redundancies and also helps ensure each organization is successful in
  fulfilling their individual missions.


  If you want to help, it is important to make sure there is actually a market
  or a need for a specific service. The only way to ensure this is through due
  diligence and working with others. Also, because most social enterprises are
  using financial resources donated by outsiders, it is imperative to make sure
  those funds are being put to good use. None of the organizations profiled in
  the book would have been successful without collaboration.

  ### Find Your Passion


  > "Entrepreneurship is often most successful when it is driven by value-based
  faith. From motivating the individual to engage in the entrepreneurial
  activity in the first place, to persuading others around her to support the
  initiative and trust the entrepreneur, deeply rooted and life-defining values
  inspire and compel."- Social Entrepreneurship in the Age of Atrocities, page
  xxxv


  Most successful pursuits in life result from a moment of obligation. This
  moment occurs when individuals begin to discover what inspires and motivates
  them and this then helps individuals recognize the ability they have to make a
  unique contribution, thus leading them to start chasing their passions.


  Although it is important to be engaged in things that we are passionate about
  in any area of life, it is absolutely imperative when becoming involved with a
  social enterprise.


  Because social enterprise seeks to change the injustice in the world, these
  ventures can face many difficulties in even getting off the ground. From
  finding a committed team of individuals to help with your mission to securing
  limited financial backing, while also considering language, cultural
  differences, and distance issues for organizations operating in foreign
  countries, social enterprises face many challenges.


  Being passionate about your cause is what will keep you committed to seeing
  your pursuit through, even when the chips are down. **Find your passion and
  then step out boldly.** Passion is integral to the success of a social
  enterprise.
f_conclusion: >-
  Although _Social Entrepreneurship in the Age of Atrocities_ was not quite the
  book I thought it was going to be, it was fascinating and highly informative.
  For anyone looking to help create positive change in our world, this book
  offers a lot of practical advice from individuals that have gone before us and
  stepped out to create solutions to some of our biggest social challenges.

**It is no secret that we are living in a world full of social injustice.** Everywhere we turn, we are bombarded by messages of inequality, oppression, political strife, and human violation.

To some, the situation may seem dire and many may feel helpless. In a time when the media may lead us to believe that we are fighting a losing battle, trying to impact the world in a positive way may seem overwhelming and unrealistic. Fortunately, Zachary D. Kaufman and his fellow contributors to _Social Entrepreneurship in the Age of Atrocities: Changing Our World_ illustrate that we already have everything we need to begin the process of making the world a more just place.

The fall of the Berlin Wall was a time of optimism and renewed hope that we would be able to move the world forward and make it a better place. Unfortunately, while some gains have been made since 1989, we have experienced a multitude of human tragedies. From two major genocides of magnitudes unprecedented since the Holocaust of World War II to the rise of ethnic conflict and escalating anti-Americanism, we are facing challenges that are often too great and interconnected for states alone to combat. Even when governments or individual states try to step in, they often unintentionally exacerbate issues or leave behind new wounds to be dealt with.

This is where social entrepreneurship comes into play; but before we can look to social enterprise for help in creating solutions to some horrific problems, we first need to understand exactly what social enterprise is. Because the field of social entrepreneurship is so young, it can be hard to define, but the book provides a good starting point: “**Social Entrepreneurship is in essence the privatization and secularization of activities that used to be considered the sole responsibility and province of government and religion.** Social Entrepreneurship often serves to ameliorate market failures. Not only do social entrepreneurs seek to fill gaps in existing political, social, economic, and legal systems, but these entrepreneurs also endeavour to rectify many of the very problems these systems often inadvertently create.”
