  ### We're Doing It Wrong


  > "Its rapid ascent is due in large part to its ability to help people avoid
  information indigestion."- Socialnomics, page 3


  Without a strong understanding of how it works, I think it’s easy to write off
  social media as “yet another marketing tool.” As Qualman brilliantly shows,
  “marketing tool” is entirely the wrong way to think of social media. Yes, you
  can sell through social media, and yes, the myriad tools – from Facebook and
  Twitter to lesser known platforms like Hi5, Orkut or Diaspora – can be
  harnessed and used effectively by marketing departments. But social media is
  so much more.


  One of my favorite criticisms of social media is the derision around a user’s
  tweets. (Oddly, the example I get more often than not is related to cats. As
  in: “Why do I care if your cat rolled over in her sleep?”).


  Too many marketers (and professionals in general) focus on the **broadcast**
  part of social media; they view it as yet another way to push their content on
  the masses. Social media is not about the push. Heck, it’s not even about the
  masses.


  Here’s the reality:


  *   The value’s **not** in the original broadcast (**Sally:** “My cat’s having
  a bad dream.”)


  If you’re in the pet care business, the value is in **_listening_** and
  **_responding_**.


  *   The value **starts** in the **response** to the broadcast.

  *   (**Tim {company rep}:** “What kind of cat do you have?”)

  *   The value **continues** in the dialogue that follows.

  *   **Sally:** “Siamese, she’s gorgeous!”

  *   **Tim:** “I love Siamese cats! That fur can be pain to manage though, eh?”

  *   The ROI comes from **the invested relationship that builds as a result.**

  *   **Sally:** “Totally! But I don’t mind; she’s worth it  Do you have one?”

  *   **Tim:** “We have a couple at the store here; next to the Birman, they’re
  my fav!”

  *   **Sally:** “What’s a Birman? I don’t know that one.”

  *   **Tim:** “Oh, they’re gorgeous! And they have beautiful personalities. You
  should totally come down and see them! Here’s a pic of one we just got in…
  {link}”

  *   **Sally**: “Ohh! So cute! I’d love to come see her. Where are you guys
  located?”


  This is an intimate, personal way to connect with your customers – on their
  terms, and on topics they are genuinely interested in. It’s a radical shift in
  thinking, and requires a totally new mindset to be harnessed effectively.

  [Gary
  Vaynerchuk](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/gary-vaynerchuk-less-talking-more-doing/)
  once answered the question, “What’s the ROI of social media?” with the
  memorable retort, “What’s the ROI of your mother?” (As an aside: Gary’s known
  for his “tweetable quotes”. This is a whole other lesson – keep your
  soundbites under 140 characters, and make it easy for people to share them
  online… Which will happen more often if they’re hilarious, as an FYI.)


  Gary’s response may sound flippant, but his point is this: dysfunctional
  families aside, most of us love our mothers unconditionally. While we can’t
  put a dollar figure to the value she’s added to our lives (nor should you…
  that would be weird), we are loyal to her and would do virtually anything for
  her. We have a **relationship** with our mothers.


  Social media is about relationships. It’s not about the quick sell, and it’s
  not a “marketing tactic”. We need to get our heads around this. Social media
  is not “yet another thing” – this is an entirely new way to interact with, and
  provide value for, your customers. So, while units of sale may be _one_ aspect
  of tracking the value of social media, you’re doing yourself and your company
  a great disservice if that’s all you’re focused on.


  What about assigning your social media budget to your R&D (Research and
  Development) department? Has there ever been a more honest, more robust market
  research opportunity? How much do you normally spend on sample test groups?


  What about thinking of your social media costs as an extension of your
  Customer Service, or PR efforts? Could you decrease call center costs by
  having someone available on Twitter or monitoring your Facebook page?


  Having direct, immediate, unfettered two-way communication with your customer
  (and potential customer) base, combined with a little ingenuity around how
  you’re going to utilize it, is a fairly incredible thing. The ROI on **that**
  could be unprecedented. It just takes a new way of thinking.

  Tweeting “50% off cat food!” doesn’t build a relationship. Showing a cat lover
  a cute picture of a new kitten does.


  We’ve talked in past articles about the importance of customer experience in
  our new digital world. Competing against the Wal-Marts of the world and a
  million other online retailers, you likely can’t compete on price. Most of us
  are selling competitive products, so you can’t really compete on quality
  either (unless you’re Apple). Where we can compete (and win) is on **user
  experience**. And what cheaper, more effective way is there to start building
  an experience than to listen to and join online conversation?


  As human beings, we have an innate desire to heard – to feel as though we’re
  understood and considered. We don’t want to be yelled at; we’ve had enough of
  that over the last 50 years. We’re saturated with _sell_ (all stocked up,
  thanks!); we’re looking for _connection_.


  Where are your clients spending time online? What are they talking about, and
  how could you join the conversation by adding **real value**?
f_conclusion: >-
  I like _Socialnomics_ for its ease of access, the topical and valuable
  examples that Qualman provides, and the focus on _Why_ social media is
  important. At the end of the day, that’s all that matters anymore – the
  **why.** We have more content thrown at us each day than we could read in a
  month. We have more tools at our disposal than we could possibly use. While
  it’s easy to feel overwhelmed, or to write it all off, it’s important to
  remember that for everything we get bombarded with, so do our customers. Give
  them a break. **Listen** to what’s important to them, and then give it to
  them. It’s as easy (and as complex) as that. Whatever you do though, do
  something. As Trip Advisor CEO Steve Kaufer states “The quickest death in this
  new world is deliberation rather than doing.” (_Socialnomics,_ page 204)

While there seem to be as many books out today on social media as there are so called “Social Media Experts,” there is no denying that the social media era is very much upon us, and all of us – regardless of position or industry – should have a rudimentary understanding of the field at the very least. This makes a book like _Socialnomics_, penned by Erik Qualman, an invaluable resource. _Socialnomics_ is a book that speaks to the _Why_ as much as it teaches the _What_ and _How_ of social media, giving even the least techie of us a solid foundation of understanding and simple set of tools to put social media to work – for ourselves and for our companies.
