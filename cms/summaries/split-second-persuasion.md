  ### Cracking the Code of Persuasion


  > "There is a special kind of persuasion – split-second persuasion. It’s a
  kind of persuasion that can get you whatever you want. Reservations.
  Contracts. Bargains. Babies. Anything. In the right hands. But which in the
  wrong hands can prove disastrous and be as brutal and deadly as any weapon
  that’s out there."- Split-Second Persuasion, page 13


  The Internet and social media have exploited all the well known norms of
  influencing. Now less is more. **We are faced with drawing on our senses,
  intellect and timing to make a memorable impact in as few words as possible.**
  Some of us are better than others at persuasion and there is a spectrum of
  talent along which each of us has our place. By learning about this mysterious
  strain of persuasion you can build upon your existing persuasive abilities and
  progress further along the spectrum.

  ### Horizons of Influence


  > "Unbelief is the friction that keeps persuasion in check. Without it,
  there’d be no limits."- Split-Second Persuasion, page 314


  The principle of how our brains make up our minds is flawed. If belief and
  emotion are so deeply intertwined, could it be that our brains are somewhat
  less discerning than we think? That they leap _before_ they look? That _first_
  they believe and _then_ appraise and consider? And the views we espouse are
  not the views that we’ve reasoned ourselves _towards_ – but instead are the
  views we’ve been unable to reason _away_ from? Though such a notion seems
  crazy, there’s evidence to suggest that it’s true. And that the feeling we get
  when we’re served up new information – of chewing it over and deciding, morsel
  by morsel, whether or not to swallow it – is actually an illusion.


  Our job as persuader is easier than we think. It’s not to get others
  _believing_ what we say. **It’s to stop them _unbelieving_.**


  Persuasion has acquired quite the reputation. To some it’s a dirty word
  associated with manipulation, coercion and deceit. To others it is an honest
  pursuit of mutual self interest where both sides benefit mutually and
  accountability is built into the deal.


  Dutton’s work provides a thorough examination of influence – the what, why and
  how. It’s well worth reading if persuasion is a crucial business skill.
  However, if persuasion seems like a dirty word to you, then your biggest
  challenge will be to redefine what you perceive persuasion to be. With a
  definition that has meaning and relevance to you, your mindset will help you
  be an intentional communicator and a principled persuader.


  When would split-second persuasion have made a difference for you?

  ### The Anatomy of Influence


  > "No two people think alike. Successful persuasion depends on who you are and
  who your audience may be."- Split-Second Persuasion, page 213


  Have you ever watched a sophisticated interrogator in action? It’s fascinating
  to watch. You would have noticed that they have much in common with the
  world’s most sophisticated con artists. They infiltrate the minds of their
  subject, drawing on street smarts to crack the code and get them to reveal
  pertinent details.


  You don’t need to be an interrogator to elicit a desired response. The process
  is available to everyone. It depends on how aware you are of the process. Do
  you recall the spiritual song “Dem Bones” by James Weldon Johnson? It goes
  something like this: “the knee bone is connected to the thigh bone; the thigh
  bone is connected to the hip bone.” The tune is memorable and the words taught
  many about their anatomy. Well, influence has an anatomy too.


  For those with persuasive talent, there are some constants otherwise known as
  the Three A’s:


  1\. The basic raw material for what you say – what your audience pays
  _attention_ to.  

  2\. The manner in which you deliver that raw material – a major predictor of
  how your audience will process or _approach_ it.  

  3\. Psychosocial factors relating to how your audience evaluates you, or
  appraises what you say, in the context of their relationship with others: the
  parameters of _affiliation_.


  Dutton’s team found the Three A’s were integral to mapping the genome of
  influence. But by digging deeper, their analysis revealed five major axes of
  persuasion – SPICE for short:


  1\. Simplicity  

  2\. Perceived self-interest  

  3\. Incongruity  

  4\. Confidence  

  5\. Empathy


  These five factors fit perfectly with the Three A’s.


  *   Simplicity and incongruity mapping onto attention

  *   Confidence on to approach

  *   Perceived self-interest and empathy on to affiliation


  Here was an influence that united all influences. That had an incubation
  period of seconds. A strain of persuasion so immediate, so dangerous, so
  _ancient_ – it didn’t just turn the tables, it kicked them over. In the number
  of words you could slap on the front of a t-shirt.


  The golden rule of any kind of persuasion – from politics to advertising, from
  negotiating that contract to preventing a large-scale race riot – is that
  **it’s not what you say that necessarily wins the day, but how you say it.**
  Often the simpler is better because our brains have a bias for simplicity.


  If your persuasion spectrum is usually a 6 or 7, applying the combo of the
  Three A’s and SPICE can take you to a 10 and dramatically increase your
  chances of getting what you want.

  "…I began to unearth a tantalizing body of evidence – circumstantial,
  anecdotal, allusive – which suggested the possibility that there really might
  be black belts of influence in our midst. And, what’s more, they might not all
  be good guys."

We are constantly reminded that we need to change mindsets – because an outdated mindset trying to solve a modern day problem is doomed to fail. Parents are warned they cannot parent their 17 year old daughter in the same way they did when she was seven. Organizations are warned that a 21st century business cannot excel with a 20th century organizational structure. Leaders are warned they cannot develop Generation Y the same way they developed Boomers. How often do individuals ignore the obvious? What will change their minds? **Is there a ‘persuasion pathway’ in our brains?**
