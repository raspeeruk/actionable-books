  ### Documenting your Plan


  > "If your business can’t operate without you, it's not a business, instead
  it's a job and possibly a miserable one."- Start at the End, page 206


  This book is designed primarily to generate your strategic plan. This is your
  road map for the future. He theorizes that the process of generating your plan
  and then reading and addressing it regularly will get your subconscious mind
  used to the fact that it can be accomplished, plus it eliminates any
  confusion, gives clarity to any employees and allows outsiders to assess the
  business quickly. The strategic plan includes your long term vision and
  aspirations, while planning is restricted to a twelve month period. This gives
  business sufficient time to allow constant analysis and measurements of
  actuals versus expected results.


  There are ten key areas with a strategic plan:


  1.  Executive summary: this is simply a summary of the most important parts of
  your strategy, what your business does, and what market it serves. It must
  also include your unique success factors, which are 4 to 7 reasons why your
  business will succeed.

  2.  Company vision statements: Most readers will be familiar with vision and
  mission statements. What sets Lavinsky’s concept apart is the idea of both an
  old school customer focused vision, and a business focused vision including
  future sale price, expected EDITDA’s (earnings before interest, taxes,
  depreciation, and amortization) and revenues that will get you there.

  3.  Opportunities to pursue: What you choose to pursue in the way of
  opportunities this year and your “why.” For example, moving your business
  online or opening in a new site.

  4.  Goals and milestones: Documentations of expected financial metrics and
  business assets over five years, one year, quarterly and monthly financials.

  5.  Financial metrics and KPI’s (key performance indicators): Documentation of
  tracked KPI’s historically, their expected values in the future and any new
  KPI’s to be measured.

  6.  Business Assets: Documentation of business assets you need to develop in
  the coming year and the individual projects. This includes team training, new
  services, more customers, etc.

  7.  Systematization Plan: Documentation of ongoing system development
  priorities and the team member responsible for implementation.

  8.  Marketing plan: Documentation of your marketing plan, how you get new
  customers, improve lead generation, conversion rates, optimize transaction
  value and maximize lifetime customer value.

  9.  Human resources plan: Identify new employees that you need to hire this
  year and outline any training for key team members to ensure the business
  model is adhered to.

  10.  Financial projections: Identify ways the company generates income,
  whether you need to borrow money for new projects, only include key financial
  projections and break it down into monthly budgets.


  The implementation and generation of a strategic plan was relatively easy for
  my own business using the downloadable templates. Potential investors were
  very impressed—a good enough reason to purchase the book alone.

  ### Delegation


  > "The fact is this: Delegating tasks to others can save you a great deal of
  time and allow you to focus that time on the highest value-added tasks."-
  Start at the End, page 161


  It is critical to delegate effectively. Lavinsky discusses 6 steps to improve
  your skills in delegating.


  1.  Identify the correct person: the right person should have the requisite
  skills to do the task.

  2.  Clearly define the project: this includes your why, completion date and
  clarity around the purpose.

  3.  Discuss the plan of action: give specifics about how the person can
  complete the task, pay attention to details, and treat the work as a process
  (rather than a task), ideally documenting the process for future use.

  4.  Have them repeat back the plan: repeat until they get the process right.

  5.  Monitor progress and provide feedback: check in and provide feedback to
  monitor progress at previously identified time schedules.

  6.  Evaluate Performance: a very important step that is often missed for
  several reasons. If they do an average job and there is no feedback, then that
  average job will become the norm. Explain why they did a great job and explain
  if there is room for improvement, using concrete examples.


  Effective delegation makes you replaceable, which is a good thing.

  ### Simple Extras


  > "In giving you these ideas, I not only wanted you to receive immediate
  gains, but I wanted to show you that you can always be making incremental
  improvements to your business."- Start at the End, page 204


  Some of the best strategies are left towards the end of the book as extras to
  include in your thinking, and include the following ideas:


  _Do more of what works_. Lavinsky tells a story that describes an engineer who
  decided to start his own consulting business after working in another company
  for 20 years. He built up the firm over 30 years to be relatively successful
  and generated over several million in revenue. He died at the age of 72 and
  left his wife the business. His wife had never run a business before, however
  after 12 months profits had doubled.


  Her strategy was simple: she liaised with management and told them to do two
  things;


  1.  Make a list of the five things that worked the best in the last 12 months
  and

  2.  Make a list of things that worked the least in the last 12 months.


  She then instructed the team to do more of the things that worked and stop
  doing the five things that didn’t. So simple, and yet, so effective. Stick to
  strategies that work and stop trying fix things that don’t.


  _Advisory Board_. Another easy strategy is to develop an advisory board.
  Choose successful people whom you respect to use as mentors/advisors. The cost
  is minimal and advisors can act as sounding boards, generate practical ideas,
  set goals and give access to valuable connections. Quarterly or monthly
  meetings are ideal.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Start at the End_ is full of inspirational ideas to take your business to the
  next level, and the tools available make it an invaluable asset to any
  business. Planning your business with your end goals in mind will help you
  stay on track, and avoid getting bogged down in day to day details.

> “If you don't know where you’re going, you probably won't get there.” _\- Yogi Berra, Start at the End, page 1_

This statement reflects Dave Lavinsky’s philosophy around business growth based on the concept of where you want to go, writing it down, and referring to it on a regular basis. The book is aimed at new or existing entrepreneurs without formal MBA training who, despite having strong motivation to keep their businesses successful, invariably become bogged down in day to day managerial issues, and forget about their long term aspirations that originally inspired them to start a business.

The book is loosely based around Covey’s second habit from [_The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/): “Begin with the end in mind.” Instead of a theoretical discussion, Lavinsky’s book gives a clear set of instructions, templates, and action steps to implement within your business. These steps are clear, simple, and easy to implement. In business it is imperative to have a vision of where you want to go, if you focus on plans of achieving those end goals as opposed to focusing on short term problems your business will flourish, Lavinsky gives us the tools to achieve this. The key is to start at the end: figure out where you want to go, and reverse engineer the process to get there.
