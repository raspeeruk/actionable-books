  ### Disrupt your Assumptions


  > "Whenever we believe there’s just one way of thinking or doing something, we
  become complacent."- Startup Your Life, page 65


  Businesses have business models and individuals have mental models. Mental
  models make us operate on autopilot. They’re great for coping with the variety
  of situations we navigate in a given day, like meal planning or driving a
  vehicle. But they also create irrational biases in our outlooks, which can
  limit our capacity for empathy.


  Akbari urges us to disrupt some of our mental models that are considered
  conventional wisdom, like “just be yourself.” Although comforting, just being
  ourselves in all situations often doesn’t end well. We always need to adapt
  and compromise to some degree.


  Ways to escape your mental models:


  *   Engage with people from outside of your usual groups

  *   Ask people how they got where they are to help you accept change and
  adjust your vision

  *   Remain aware of which of your ideas are inaccurate or out-dated, and scan
  for updates.


  Our mental states need to be dynamic to reflect the world’s dynamic nature.
  Disrupting our mental models and creating more diversity of thought can lead
  to more opportunities. Just as companies like Blackberry floundered when they
  started to rely too much on groupthink, we need to be flexible to stay
  competitive. Unlearning is hard, but we need to continually reflect on our way
  of thinking to know if a mental model is limiting us. There’s always more than
  one way of doing something.

  ### Establish Product Market Fit


  > "As you try to find your niche—whether it’s personal or professional—staying
  nimble and picking up on contextual clues is key."- Startup Your Life, page 80


  Whether it’s the job or dating market, catering to your audience is about
  figuring out where what’s essential for you overlaps with what interests them.
  This takes empathy, and operating from an empathic perspective is the result
  of observing your audience.


  The most successful personal reinventions and product innovation comes from
  getting the details right. Gmail was in beta mode for 5 years, but it allowed
  them to experiment, refine, and grow their devoted user base and technical
  capacity while making absolute sure that their product fit the market. We
  should all go into beta mode periodically, if it isn’t forced upon us already.


  Credibility matters too when it comes to finding an audience. We earn it
  through loyalty and “everyday heroism” like offering up a seat or being
  present with a friend. You win people over with who you are, not just what you
  can do. And even when you feel you’ve got your market figured out, you may
  need to change course or start over at any time, given the fluidity of the
  market—and of life.

  ### Make Decisions Based on Experience


  > "Experimentation is the best path to clarity and sustainability."- Startup
  Your Life, page 50


  Anyone who has struggled to make a decision can probably see how more
  experimentation could have made the decision easier. Experimentation is the
  new planning. Once you’ve observed, and created a vision and hypothesis, start
  to experiment to increase your confidence about one option or the other. At
  the least, you’ll become more competent and maybe even more lucky.


  Indeed, luck is now considered by researchers to be a result of our openness
  to experiment and an upbeat attitude, rather than just something that we
  stumble on by chance. Almost all successful startups will have a path full of
  experimentation, but somehow individuals usually seem to think they’ll get it
  right the first time.


  Psychologist Richard Wiseman says people increase their luck by:


  *   Noticing chance opportunities

  *   Making decisions by listening to intuition

  *   Projecting positive expectations that become self fulfilling prophecies

  *   Exercising resilience


  If we make a habit of paying close attention to our surroundings, we can turn
  our lives into a constant experiment where each result is a part of a bigger
  picture, not an end in itself. Inventor Thomas Edison conducted thousands of
  failed experiments in his life, but his persistence led him to some major
  breakthroughs. Negative results can be the best kind of results when they
  provide information we can apply to make the next attempts stronger. Once
  you’ve identified many of the wrong paths, the right ones start to appear.
f_conclusion: >-
  If happiness is something that we create over a lifetime, then staying in
  action is what counts. Make sure to regularly disrupt your assumptions, use
  experiments to make decisions, and find and adapt to where you belong, and
  you’ll have the best chance of a fulfilled life.

> “Personal fulfillment is created, not inherited or earned.” _\- Startup Your Life, page 14_

_Startup Your Life_ is a guide to finding happiness using concepts from startup culture. Ideas like failing fast and product market fit are all relevant when applied to our professional, romantic, and financial lives, and in the way we make decisions and establish routines. The entrepreneurial mindset is about following a process that requires discipline and constant readjusting.

Author Anna Akbari realized that she could use the entrepreneurial approach as a way to improve her life after hitting a hard spot in New York as a new graduate with a sociology degree. She targeted different aspects of her life and systematically transformed herself through a series of personal sociological experiments. After spending time in the entrepreneurial world, she’s now an innovation consultant, and believes that we can all be “serial reinventors” of our own lives.
