  ### Nothing is Original


  > "All creative work builds on what came before. Nothing is completely
  original."- Steal Like an Artist, page 7


  The premise for this book, which I have read twice already, is that nothing is
  original. When I first read this I have to admit it took me by surprise. I had
  never really thought about it before. What completely resonated with me, as I
  pondered the notion that it all has been done before, is that this idea is
  actually very freeing. It removes the “burden of trying to be completely
  original.” No pressure. Can’t come up with that new product? Pulling your hair
  out to develop the next best viral sensation? Trying to figure out what to
  write about next? No pressure. It has already been done before. So, go look at
  the best of what has been done before and steal from it.

  ### School yourself


  > "Always be reading… It’s not the book you start with, it’s the book that
  book leads you to."- Steal Like an Artist, page 20


  Austin Kleon is a big fan of schooling himself in the analog world. He
  believes in being a regular at your local library and physically surrounding
  yourself with lots of books. He says “nothing is more important than an unread
  library.”


  In this digital age I find the premise of surrounding yourself with physical
  books to be ‘avant-garde’ as so many advocate for the latest tablet or
  electronic gadget. But of course, Austin Kleon is talking to a kindred spirit
  here, with his love and appreciation for books in print.


  This idea of following a literary trail of any book is almost magical. A
  little like the breadcrumb trail that the fairy tale characters Hansel and
  Gretel left to help them find their way home. Following the trail starting
  with one book could take you absolutely anywhere. Places you have never gone
  before, encountering ideas you probably have never though. Places full of
  ideas to steal.


  Another method of schooling yourself that Austin Kleon writes about is
  sharing. Here the idea is that the more you share, the more you learn. Sort of
  the reverse of stealing I suppose. He speaks from experience when he says that
  he’s “learned so much from the people that submit poems to my site. I find a
  lot of things to steal, too. It benefits me as much as it does them.”

  ### Steal like an artist


  > "Art is theft."- Pablo Picasso, Steal Like an Artist, page I


  Austin Kleon, a writer and artist himself, speaks to the age old question that
  people ask creative types, “Where do you come up with all your ideas?” As Mr.
  Kleon says: “every new idea is just a mash up or a remix of one or more
  ideas.”


  Of course, ideas can come and go with daily life. And interruptions can cause
  a perpetual state of forgetfulness (at least for me). That is why, as the
  author suggests, you should always carry a notebook and a pen with you
  wherever you go. This way when you see something, experience or hear something
  new, you can pull it out and jot down your impressions, feelings or thoughts.
  Try “copying favorite passages out of books, record overheard conversations or
  doodle when you’re on the phone.”


  To steal like an artist you need to view anything and everything as a
  potential source. Take from it what you will and make it your own. A starting
  point is to copy what and who you love. Your heroes, whether literary,
  academic, or scientific all offer a field of ideas ripe for the stealing. It
  can be overwhelming this stealing like an artist so “first, you figure out
  what’s worth stealing, and then you move on to the next thing.” The author
  suggests that you go deep when you steal and “don’t just steal the style but
  the real treasure worth stealing is the thinking behind the style. You don’t
  want to look like your heroes; you want to see like your heroes.”
f_conclusion: >-
  It takes a bit of getting used to, to think of yourself as a thief as we
  immediately associate the word with an illegal, deviant form of behavior. But,
  I think Mr. Kleon is on to something. So, I for one, will embrace this kind of
  thievery and will share the results of my loot with whomever is interested.

I’m a thief. At least I want to be a thief. Since reading this _New York Times_ Best Seller by Austin Kleon, I have been stealing like crazy. Don’t worry, the author clarifies the difference between plagiarism and stealing and rest assured I am all out stealing. The concept behind _Steal Like An Artist: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Being Creative_ is that we learn by copying. As Mr.Kleon reminds us, even as youngsters we learn how to talk and walk by copying those older people around us. The more we copy the more practice we get doing what we love. Eventually the final version is our own. The fact that we were inspired and influenced by the work of others leads us to our own discoveries and creations. This is what stealing is all about. If you are looking for a book to take with you on vacation, you won’t go wrong with packing this little treasure in your suitcase. The graphics, photos and easy to read format are engaging on all levels. You will find yourself flipping from page to page and back again preparing for your new assignment as thief in training.
