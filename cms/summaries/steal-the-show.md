  ### Be Yourself


  > "Finding your voice is important for your results. If you want to play
  different roles authentically and amplify or downplay different parts of your
  personality to do so, it’s important to be comfortable with who you really are
  and what you stand for so you never lose sight of your values."- Steal the
  Show, page 5


  Having the courage to be you, or finding your voice as Port calls it, is not
  easy. But then again, if you want to shine and put on the best performance of
  your life, you have to leave your comfort zone. Many of the biggest
  accomplishments have been achieved when we step outside our comfortable spots
  and push the limits.


  One of the first steps to being yourself is to let go of your inner critic.
  Stop being so hard on yourself and don’t be afraid to take a chance. Port
  asserts that reducing self-criticism can boost the natural conviction that
  what you have to say matters as much as anyone else.


  An additional tip to increase your authenticity is to not be afraid to talk
  about your weaknesses, difficulties or differences. This can be difficult
  since no one wants to be seen as vulnerable, especially in a room filled with
  strangers. But being open about your weaknesses can make you more approachable
  and will allow you to connect with the audience at a much deeper level. As the
  author states “what you say doesn’t have to be different to make a difference.
  It’s the way you say it that matters.”


  Providing a personal story that’s related to the message you’re sharing can
  boost your authenticity. Port also reiterates the importance of not making
  your presentation goals unattainable. In other words, you don’t have to have
  all the answers or solutions. Admitting you don’t know something can increase
  your credibility with the audience. A great place to start boosting your
  credibility is through improvisation.

  ### Be in the Moment


  > "Showing empathy for the audience means I’m paying attention to how they are
  listening and what they are feeling."- Steal the Show, page 75


  A key step for being in the moment during your big presentation is to be
  prepared and well-rehearsed. Preparation gives you the confidence to be
  present and in the moment because your brain is not so focused on remembering
  the material. It allows you to pick up on the audience’s visual cues and be a
  better listener. When listening, clear your mind of anything other than what
  is being said and try not to plan your response until the person has finished
  speaking.


  Port also reiterates the importance of using all your senses to notice
  people’s reactions after something is said. Is the audience getting restless
  or tired or are they paying attention to every word, writing down notes?
  Sensing audience engagement or lack of it allows you to connect with the
  audience.

  ### The Value of Improv


  > "Every speaker faces difficult situations and surprises at some point—improv
  is great training for saving those moments during a performance."- Steal the
  Show, page 182


  Learning to improvise is a great resource for improving your presentations. It
  boosts your confidence, increasing your adaptability to handle any situation.
  Improvising also sharpens the skill-set needed to deal with difficult moments
  when things don‘t go as planned.


  A group exercise Port suggests to improve your improvisation techniques is the
  story game. A theme or setting is provided to the group as well as an opening
  line such as, _The cat jumped over_ _the moon_. The first group member then
  proceeds to build on the opening line until the facilitator says _next_, and
  the story-line then moves on to the next person and so on.


  Another technique that the author refers to throughout the book is to adopt a
  mindset of _yes, and._ Saying yes and, “begins the positive cycle of creative,
  productive problem solving.” It’s about having the courage to explore all
  possibilities to find out what works and what doesn’t. Saying no shuts down
  creativity, discourages audience engagement and prevents creative dialogue.
f_conclusion: >-
  Being in the moment is all about being present. To fully engage the audience,
  you have to be aware of what’s going on. This valuable book summarizes many
  practical tips from Port’s acting background and public speaking successes.
  Following his advice will boost your confidence and presentation skill sets,
  and help you to steal the show at your next presentation.

  negotiation rather than how you think you’re doing and what you think people

> “Always focus on the outcome you want to achieve in a meeting, interview, or negotiation rather than how you think you’re doing and what you think people will think of you.” _\- Steal the Show, page 36_

There are many people who would easily rank public speaking as more fearful than death itself. This valuable, action packed book aims to transform that fear into courage. By concentrating on the goal for the presentation instead of people’s impressions, the author believes the fear will diminish.

Michael Port is a former actor and best-selling author, who now helps people deliver show-stopping performances by speaking at corporate events. His recent book, _Steal the Show: From Speeches to Job Interviews to Deal-Closing Pitches. How to Guarantee a Standing Ovation for All the Performances in Your Life_ by Michael Port, distills actionable advice for novice and advanced speakers as well.

Whether you’re prepping for an interview, sales call, or presentation to the board of directors, Port’s advice will have you feeling confident and engaging your audience. Prior to your show-stopping performance though, it’s important that your authenticity comes out.
