  ### You ARE a Leader


  > "Not only is leadership not a position, but the truth also is that you can’t
  not lead."- Stepping Up, page 91


  People often view leadership as a responsibility that comes with a position
  (manager, director, vice president, etc.) The truth is, however, that **each
  and every one of us “leads” every day.** Whenever we encounter a problem or
  situation and choose to act, or not act, we are leading. We might not always
  be aware of it, but we cannot help but have an influence (and thus “lead”) the
  people around us. In Izzo’s words, “simply by showing up a certain way in our
  life and work, each of us creates a ripple even if we don’t intend to.”


  _Hmm… damned if I do, damned if I don’t…_


  For those who are not convinced of this, Izzo asserts that **when we suddenly
  find ourselves sounding or acting like one of our parents, we are showing that
  our parents are influencing us without intending or trying to do so** (in
  fact, they don’t even have to be physically present to do it.) And, he says
  that if your parents are doing this, you are doing it too – not just to your
  kids, but to everyone you encounter.


  So, guess what? Regardless of whether you wanted to, you’ve already stepped
  up. You are already a leader.


  If you’re like me, then after learning this, you’re probably thinking that
  you’d rather lead intentionally than unintentionally. To this end, Izzo
  suggest that we consider how we are using the influence that we already have.

  ### Scaling Down Stepping Up


  > "Find one thing. Think of something at work, in your life, or in the world
  that you want to do something about."- Stepping Up, page 75


  Often, when I notice a problem that I wish would change (e.g. garbage on the
  side of the road), I quickly come up with grandiose plans in my mind to rid
  the world of the problem (e.g. a combination of a series of community clean-up
  events, newspaper editorials, radio interviews.) Although I’d like to believe
  that some of my plans would work, the reality is that I often let the
  complexity of my plans prevent me from even taking action (my usual excuse is
  that I just don’t have time or energy to implement the plan). Apparently, I’m
  not the only person who does this.


  For those who suffer from this problem, Izzo suggests that we stop trying to
  “hatch a master plan” and focus instead on identifying one thing that we can
  do now, immediately, to “move in the direction of the change you seek.” So, if
  I apply this to my displeasure at seeing garbage on the side of the road, I
  could choose to keep garbage bags in my car trunk and stop to pick up garbage
  when I see it instead of organizing a series of community clean-up events. Or,
  I might set aside an afternoon to visit a place where I’ve noticed a lot of
  litter and just take it upon myself to pick things up. **The point is that
  doing something, regardless of how small, is better than making big plans and
  then doing nothing.**

  ### Stepping Up with Intention


  > "One way to get in touch with how you want to be influential is to ask
  yourself what your intention is every day. That is, in what ways do you want
  to influence others every day, just by the way you show up."- Stepping Up,
  page 92


  The suggestion Izzo makes in the quote above is a very simple and very
  powerful way to step up and make a difference. Imagine how much better the
  world would be if everyone started their day by deciding on and then declaring
  their intention. How would things change at home if you reminded yourself
  daily that you intend to show your family members that you love them? How
  different would your workplace be if you decided to bring courage, compassion,
  or hope to others in the office?


  Personally, I found this idea inspiring and have begun to practice it. I can
  tell you that it _has_ made a difference in my life. Give it a try. You don’t
  have to go public with your intention and announce it to your family or
  colleagues for it to work.
f_conclusion: >-
  John Izzo ends _Stepping Up_ by admitting the desire to leave the reader with
  some profound, inspirational statement, something memorable. Instead, he ends
  by expressing his hope that his book will cause readers to take action, to
  “step up” and make a difference in the world. He writes, “It is my hope you
  will focus even more on taking responsibility and even less on pointing
  fingers. I hope you will stop trying to get others to change and focus even
  more on trying to change yourself. I also hope that you will assume you can
  change things and do what you can, while encouraging others to step up even if
  it seems naïve of them to try.”

> "Stepping up is seeing a need and deciding YOU are the right person to do something about it." _\- Stepping Up, page 5_

John Izzo has decided that you ARE the right person to do something about “it” (regardless of what “it” is.) In _Stepping Up: How Taking Responsibility Changes Everything_, Izzo takes on helping you figure out what “it” is, convincing you to take action, and providing suggestions on “how” to do so.

Izzo aims to convince you to step up by sharing how others, from all walks of life, have stepped up and showing what has happened when they did so. His examples include the following:

*   The owner of a small wholesale paint store who stood up to the Mafia in Naples, Italy
*   Two young teachers who took on education reform
*   An accountant who is doing her part to rid the world of the plastic contributing to the floating Great Pacific Garbage Patch ([http://myplasticfreelife.com/](http://myplasticfreelife.com/))
*   A homeless dumpster diver who started a recycling program that now employs hundreds of homeless people

Each chapter of the book focuses on a point in support of two main messages Izzo wants to convey about stepping up into leadership. The first message is that you can make a difference, that really _anyone_ can make a difference. His second message is that **it’s okay to start _small_ . . . as long as you _start_ something.**

To help readers get started, Izzo ends each chapter with a section titled, “Ways to step up” where he provides two or three suggestions on _how_ to step up. Below are two examples of the practical suggestions that Izzo provides in these sections:

**Catch yourself blaming someone for a problem.** When you find yourself in that position, ask yourself, “In what way am I contributing to the problem?” Ask, “what can I do to make things better?”

**Question your hesitation**. When tempted to stay on the sidelines, ask which you will regret more, trying without success or holding back. In most cases, thinking it through causes us to realize that failure or moderate success is much more palatable than having never tried.

Izzo has succeeded with me. After reading _Stepping Up_, I find myself stepping up more frequently and in more parts of my life.

How are you stepping up?
