  ### Flossing can enhance creativity


  > "It would be many years before I began to understand that all of life is
  practice: writing, driving, hiking, brushing teeth, packing lunch boxes,
  making beds, cooking dinner, making love, walking dogs, even sleeping. We are
  always practicing. Only practicing."- Still Writing, page 75


  If you want to deepen your creativity and produce great work, you should start
  by changing a habit or two. As you know, this is not easy. I’m embarrassed to
  say it took me years to start flossing regularly. Once I finally started
  massaging my gums nightly, I was reminded that developing a new habit –
  whether big or small or even as unsexy as flossing – **is** possible and it
  can be an incredibly empowering breakthrough that can lead to other new
  habits.


  I’ll warn you now – I’m going to ask you to make a few big changes in your
  daily routine. These changes will pull you away from the screens in your life
  – iPhone, TV, and laptop – and may even feel a bit archaic. _Who actually
  writes on paper with ink nowadays?_


  When it comes to our creativity, I think experimenting with your own habits is
  integral to the process. So let’s view this as a lil’ game and see what
  happens, eh?

  ### Make a mess


  > "Just as we need to feel our feet on the earth, smell and taste the world
  around us, the pen scratching against the page, sensory and slow, is the
  different between looking at a high-definition picture of a flower and holding
  that very same flower in your palm…"- Still Writing, page 105


  Writing longhand in a notebook and typing on your laptop are two very
  different experiences.


  When you sit down to create – whether you’re writing a novel or developing a
  new strategy for your sales team – do you choose keys over ink? _I usually
  do._


  Typing makes me feel fast, efficient and unstoppable as I slam the keys. When
  I write in my notebook, I slow down. My mind travels to new places. I cross
  out words, I doodle, I underline. The page becomes messy very quickly. Maybe
  that’s why I’ve avoided it.


  I challenge you (and myself) to learn to love the beautiful, complicated mess
  and the playful process of creating with pen and paper. The notebook allows
  you _“to see a road map of your progress as you build the architecture of your
  story”_. The screen’s white space may put your mind at ease – _so neat and
  tidy!_ – but you lose the fever. And the fever carries you forward, deeper
  into your work.


  Here’s how to experiment with longhand:


  1.  **Pick a notebook** – choose one that lights you up. A notebook that you
  actually want to carry.

  2.  **Choose a pen that feels good** – one that makes you want to doodle for
  days at a time.


  **Start your next project here,** with the notebook and pen. Allow yourself
  time for discovery amid the chaos.

  ### Wake up to words, not your iPhone

  approach the page yourself, that music will carry you."- Still Writing, page

  What’s the first thing you do when you wake up every morning?


  Many of us – barely awake – reach out desperately to grab our iPhones and
  check email, Facebook, the news, etc. _All fires must be put out before we
  brush our teeth!_


  This routine may feel normal and it may even make you feel like you’re at the
  top of your game. But is it healthy?


  Dani Shapiro strongly recommends you view your first few minutes awake in the
  morning as sacred time, setting the tone for the rest of the day. **Instead of
  grabbing your iPhone immediately, pull out a paperback book and read.** Think
  of it as breakfast for your mind.


  Here are 3 simple rules that may help you change this habit:


  1.  **Don’t sleep with your iPhone.** It’s pretty simple. Give Siri a bedroom
  of her own, somewhere far away from your bed. If you use your phone as an
  alarm, buy a new [alarm
  clock](http://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Home-Kitchen-Alarm-Clocks/zgbs/home-garden/3734911)
  on Amazon. They cost ten dollars – you can afford it.

  2.  **Strategically place a few of your favorite books near your bed**, within
  arms reach. Dani Shapiro keeps the following books in a pile next to her:
  Virginia Woolf’s _A Writer’s Diary_ and Thomas Merton’s _Thoughts in
  Solitude_. Blogs and magazines do not count for this exercise. Devour a
  delicious book, something that will give you the fuel you need for the day.


  **Read for anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.** If you need to set your
  alarm slightly earlier, do it. Allow yourself to linger in bed with your books
  and avoid running through your checklist for the day. Stay present and gently
  ease into your day.

  I believe technology is a beautiful thing, when we control its role in our
  lives. I’ve noticed it has a way of creeping, uninvited, into sacred areas of
  my life like dinnertime, bedtime and my own creative time.

> "Everything you need to know about life can be learned from a genuine and ongoing attempt to write." _\- Still Writing, page 1_

**I don’t crush on celebrities – I crush on writers.** Maybe it’s their mysterious nature or the way they build routine and discipline into their lives. Or maybe it’s the fact that they seem to get life and they slow down enough to observe the world instead of zooming through it like I tend to do.

Whatever it is, I dig writers and I believe we can learn a lot from their lifestyles and creative processes. In _Still Writing: The Perils and Pleasures of a Creative Life_, author Dani Shapiro shares a collection of stories, meditations and advice about her own creative life, providing exceptional insight for all creative folks (_like_ _you!_), **not** just writers.

Together, we’ll follow Dani’s guide and **extract a layer of technology from our own creative lifestyles.**

It’s important for all of us to audit our own relationship with technology and truly understand the ways in which it is improving our lives and alternatively, the ways in which it is damaging our lives.

And by all means, kick Siri out of the bedroom.

_“If I dismiss the ordinary – waiting for the special, the extreme, the extraordinary to happen – I may just miss my life.”_
