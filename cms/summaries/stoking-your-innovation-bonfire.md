  ### Move Innovation to the Centre


  > "You have to make sure that stakeholders know not only that innovation is
  important to the organization, but also what innovation means in their
  organization and how they can participate."- Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire,
  page 10


  Is innovation at the centre – the heart – of your company? If it isn’t, it
  should be. Your employees must recognize that innovation is not only valued,
  but is a priority in your organization. “Otherwise,” as Kelley writes, “how
  can stakeholders be expected to make any significant changes?” (10)


  As most of us know, humans are naturally resistant to change (doubly so in
  business, where failure can mean termination). To circumvent this fear, a
  clear **innovation vision** must be articulated (complete with a plan) by the
  senior leaders. As Kelly explains, “An effort to move innovation to the center
  is best led by the CEO, but it requires the support and involvement of the
  senior leadership to tell the stories to employees and customers about what
  the organization is trying to achieve, what innovation means to their
  organization, and how the employees and other stakeholders can participate.”
  (10)


  An innovation vision is fluid and always changing, depending upon the
  marketplace’s needs at any given time. That said, there are a few places we
  can start in creating our own.

  ### Accessing the Voice of the Customer


  > "The man or woman stitching up your clothing has no idea whether the
  stitching method worked well for you, or if you were happy with the product.
  They only know whether they made their daily quota and how much failed Quality
  Control. If the persons stitching up your clothing had access to the voice of
  the costumer, would they do their job differently? Would they feel differently
  about their job?"- Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire, page 47


  In today’s business world, the employee class is largely disconnected from the
  voice of the customer. A consumer’s thoughts on a product or service, whether
  they loved it, were generally satisfied but thought it required improvement,
  hated it, or otherwise is typically relegated to the company’s marketing or
  customer research department. Kelley would argue that this detachment between
  the employee class and the consumer is not conducive to innovation and the
  creation of a quality product or service.


  “Today’s customer benefits from marketing developments such as mass
  customization, mass personalization, and micro-segmentation. In addition, they
  have unrivaled access to communication channels to make their preferences
  known.” (47) I found the example that Kelley provided, and quoted at the
  beginning of this insight to be a good one. I’ll offer another. My favourite
  holiday film, _A Christmas Carol_, starring Alastair Sim was released two
  years ago on Blu-ray by VCI Home Entertainment. While the quality of the film
  on Blu-ray was miles ahead of the previous standard definition DVD incarnation
  (especially for a 60 year old film), there were still many problems with the
  video and audio that could have easily been avoided. As Kelley writes, today’s
  consumer “has unrivaled access to communication channels”. Today’s home video
  enthusiasts are especially savvy. Gone are the days when you blindly picked up
  a movie off the shelf; today there are reviewers to tell you if a film has
  been properly presented on home video. The said reviewers pointed these flaws
  in their reviews of _A Christmas Carol_, which deterred many from purchasing
  the film. Consumers in turn voiced these problems on such online forums as the
  Home Theater Forum and Blu-ray.com, and on VCI’s Facebook page and through
  their customer support e-mail address. This year they’re releasing the film
  again on Blu-ray and have vowed that they have gotten their product right this
  time. If they don’t, you know consumers will be using these online outlets to
  make sure their voices are heard.


  Simply stated, Kelley is an advocate of allowing anyone in a company to access
  to the voice of the customer – for the betterment of the company, the employee
  and the consumer. As Kelley himself asks, “what do you have to lose?” Nothing!


  **Who in your company is interacting directly with the end user? Are there
  other people that should be?** (The answer is “yes”, by the way.)

  ### Innovate for the Future Present


  > "The ideal is to design a product based on customer insights appropriate to
  the time of the product launch to maximize the useful life of the customer
  insights."- Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire, page 57


  In researching _Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire_, Kelley spoke with
  ethnographer Cynthia DuVal who advised ethnographers and researchers involved
  in innovation “to consider the timeline of the development process when
  extracting insights.” (56) This is critical to success because “if you’ve got
  a 12- to 18-month product or service development process to go from insight to
  in-market, then you should be looking not to identify the insights that are
  most relevant today, but the insights that will be most relevant 12 to 18
  months from now.” (56) This is innovating for the **future present,**
  anticipating what your consumers will need at the time when you plan to launch
  your product or service. This kind of innovation isn’t easy, and necessitates
  flexibility in case the insights you have predicted are a little off the mark.
  But almost all of the leaders in any particular field (Apple, for instance)
  have mastered this. Those who haven’t have fallen behind, many irretrievably
  so. The trick for innovating for the present future is to get to know your
  customer well and learn to think one step ahead of them.


  **What is your customer asking for? What can you extrapolate from that to
  identify what they _might_want in the future?**
f_conclusion: >-
  Braden Kelley’s _Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire_ is a small book jam packed
  with invaluable information on how to ignite innovation and is a vital tool in
  helping erode the barriers to lasting innovation. Throughout the text Kelley
  provides many helpful illustrations, diagrams, and graphs, as well as more
  than 30 pages of appendices to get your innovation juices flowing. He even
  went so far as to establish InnovationBonfire.com for the overflow of material
  that didn’t make the final manuscript. (Where you can be sure there’s plenty
  of opportunity for user feedback) Simply put, _Stoking Your Innovation
  Bonfire_ is a must read to help you and your team get innovating, and stay
  ahead of the competition.

Braden Kelley, author of _Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire_, is no stranger to innovation. He was the founder of Blogging Innovation, the internet’s fastest growing innovation community. He has recently teamed up with another innovating authority Rowan Gibson (who penned the forward to this book), who have collaborated on InnovationExcellence.com.

_Stoking Your Innovation Bonfire_is a distillation of his original blog, and is an invaluable resource for managers looking to break down the barriers that prevent innovation in their companies and organizations.
