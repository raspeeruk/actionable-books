  ### Flashes of Insight


  > "By pulling together these various sources, we are able to arrive at a
  modern discipline that puts flashes of insight at the center of a philosophy
  of action across all fields of human endeavor."- Strategic Intuition, page 1


  The “various sources” Duggan refers to, in the line above, come from the
  book’s many innovation examples in the fields of science, psychology,
  business, neuroscience, education, social enterprise, and military strategy.
  _Strategic Intuition_ is a whirlwind tour of the history of innovation and
  creative thinking. This journey of discovery underlines and reinforces the
  **consistency of a conscious, or unconscious process the innovators followed**
  to develop their new ideas and successful endeavors – from Napoleon to Martin
  Luther King; Picasso to ex-IBM CEO Lou Gertsner; from Grameen Bank founder
  Mahamad Yunus to Thomas Kuhn, the great historian of scientific achievement.


  In all the examples we review, none of the innovators began with a master
  theory. But, they **all shared a pattern**. Duggan reveals, through interviews
  and biographies, how Bill Gates & Paul Allen (Microsoft), Sergey Brins & Larry
  Page (Google) , and Steve Jobs (Apple) were successful , not because of any
  preconceived opinions, but through mixing successful elements around them that
  they saw were working through a “flash of insight”. In most cases, these
  flashes of insight created something the innovators **could not have foreseen
  otherwise**. Microsoft, Google, and Apple are given as examples of companies
  formed out of a spontaneous recombination of successful elements spotted by
  the founders. They were more a “strategy of rearrangement, not invention”.


  Why is this particular process so prevalent? Duggan offers that this
  recombinant activity is the way the brain works naturally and most
  effectively. He points to **advancements in neuroscience** that have been
  steadily charting how the brain functions. Key research came from
  neuropsychiatrist Eric Kandel who won the 2000 Nobel Prize for his work
  overturning the two brain – right brain, left brain – theory (even though that
  old brain model is still held by many management practitioners and trainers).
  Today an MRI machine can “see” how a single thought sparks activity in
  multiple brain areas, including left and right sides simultaneously.


  This newest working model of the brain recognizes that intuition and analysis,
  the creative and the logical, are together in all modes of thought.
  Neuroscientists have observed more of a “mosaic” or “intelligent memory” model
  of brain functioning where the brain is recognized as “the greatest inventory
  system on earth” and that it takes information apart (parsing) and stores it
  in the “shelves of the brain”, readying it for future use. This **structural
  mechanism in the brain** is the basis for strategic intuition and it suggests
  that the brain is hardwired and maximally effective at developing new ideas
  through flashes of insight – combining old ideas and recent knowledge into new
  ideas and vision.


  The extensive documentation, research, and examples given make a very strong
  case for the theory of strategic intuition and flashes of insight as a serious
  model to use for anyone looking for more innovation and creative ideas.

  ### Welcome to the Matrix (team tool)


  > "The operative assumption is that someone, somewhere, has a better idea; and
  the operative compulsion is to find out who has that better idea, learn it,
  and put it into action – fast."- Strategic Intuition, page 141


  Developed at GE and heavily utilized by CEO Jack Welch and Chief Learning
  Officer Steve Kerr, the what-works matrix was used to solve all types of
  problems and challenges. The matrix mapped out the issue in question by
  stating, on the first line, your understanding of the situation or goal. Next,
  you identify and list all the elements you think are part of a good solution
  to the problem. Then, you ask yourself who has successfully solved any of
  these elements or pieces of the puzzle before and list those sources across
  the top. Now, “the treasure hunt” begins as you start exploring the sources
  and filling in the matrix with what could work.


  To better understand, here’s an example of what a matrix model might look
  like:


  **Situation or Challenge**


  **Sources of Prior Success**


  Source #1 Source #2 Source #3Source #4Source #5


  **Element #1**


  **Element #2**


  **Element #3**


  **Element #4**


  **Element #5**


  **Element #6**


  The value of the matrix is that it generates a **creative, visual exercise**
  that a company or team could follow without it being bound by any single
  approach or bias. Essentially, it helps you piece together new ideas from a
  combination of old ideas from many different sources, industries and
  approaches.

  ### The four steps towards innovation (mind training)


  > "These four elements apply to all fields of human endeavor."- Strategic
  Intuition, page 61


  _Strategic Intuition_ **provides an actionable process** you can apply to any
  challenge – the same mental process used consistently by many of history’s
  greatest and most successful innovators. Duggan outlines this step-by-step
  innovation system in the hopes that “by understanding how it works, you can do
  it more and better yourself”.


  Duggan describes the **non-linear, thought process of innovation creation**
  as:


  1) Start by building a strong knowledge base through _extensive_ study of the
  issue at hand and its elements, both within and outside of your industry.


  2) Drop preconceptions and clear your mind to be open to new possibilities.


  3) Proceed to opportunistically combine and re-combine elements of the issue
  with sources discovered (history and what is working around you) until they
  come together in a new combination that addresses the problem.


  4) Have the resolve to test and follow through the new idea to make it happen.


  Take a problem you are currently working on and try tackling it with the above
  process to generate new solutions. See where it takes you.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Strategic Intuition_ wants you to think about where ideas come from and
  consider how your mind works. It is a fascinating exploration into **how the
  human brain rearranges and connects experience and knowledge to create
  entirely new ideas in flashes of insight**. It gives us the renewed confidence
  and the steps to take to address our biggest challenges.

Is there a common way of thinking, or mental mechanism, at the heart of outstanding advancements across all fields and disciplines? It would be a hell of a thing if there was, right? Well, Columbia Business School associate professor William Duggan, offers an insightful book that makes a strong case that there is and that anyone can do it. He calls that mechanism “strategic intuition”.

While [_The Medici Effect_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-medici-effect/), which I reviewed last month, describes external mechanisms for new idea creation, _Strategic Innovation_ focuses on the internal mechanisms. Many books discuss innovation and creativity, but few delve into the actual details or offer suggestions on **how those new ideas happen**. _Strategic Intuition_ explains how the mind takes huge leaps to the next “big” idea.
