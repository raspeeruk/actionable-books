  ### It’s all on you. Learning a living.


  > "The importance of keeping our skills and abilities fresh in order to be
  competitive in the job marketplace is mandatory. To keep nudging our own
  sell-by date out further, we must be in constant refresh mode."- Stretch, page

  The hero message of _Stretch,_ for me, as obvious as it may read, came from
  _The Stretch Imperative_. At its heart lies three recurring themes for
  building a successful career in the future. They are: _1\. It’s all on you. 2.
  You need options, and 3. You have dreams._


  Imperative #1, **It’s all on you**, is the reality check we need. No matter
  whether we have a boss or are in business for ourselves, experience and
  capabilities for ‘tomorrow’s workplace’ are unlikely to land in our laps. It’s
  up to us to find them, build and understand them.


  But we **need options** to help us stretch. Options come from diverse networks
  of contacts and being open to experiencing new things. If we are serious about
  stretching to our full future potential, we need to **have dreams** and create
  a “living of learning”.


  To prepare ourselves for a career or business opportunity tomorrow, we need to
  be individually proactive in learning and understanding what lies ahead of our
  current role and industry. We must build capabilities that “future-proof” us
  and set us up for success.

  ### Capability building


  > "The number one concern employees around the world share is that their
  position will change or their skills will become obsolete."- Stretch, page 221


  In _Stretch_, capacity refers to “a collection of credentials, skills and
  qualifications that demonstrate accomplishment and potential in a given area”
  to help you “future-proof” yourself for tomorrow. There are many core
  capabilities successfully used by professionals around the world to stretch
  themselves within the workplace and develop their careers. The authors list
  ten key ones within the book.


  1.  **Functional excellence:** developing a depth of skills that allows you to
  understand the bigger strategic picture and contribute effectively to the
  creative process.

  2.  **Emotional intelligence**: the ability to collaborate and communicate
  with other departments and teams without bias or agenda.

  3.  **Personal advocacy:** building your own personal brand so that people
  seek you out and put you on their team.

  4.  **Cross-cultural dexterity**: being flexible to work with and across many
  countries, ethnicities, genders, ages and backgrounds.

  5.  **“Geek” Acumen**: staying up to date with emerging and relevant
  technologies.

  6.  **Virtual Collaboration**: having the ability to interact with and use
  technology based communications tools, i.e. Skype or Google hangouts.

  7.  **Entrepreneurial Spirit**: the ability and willingness to take risks.
  Being genuinely passionate about your job.

  8.  **Creative problem-solving**: be adaptable and able to change solutions
  depending on circumstances.

  9.  **Leadership:** an authentic desire to be transparent and have two-way
  communication.

  10.  **“Stretchpertise”**: adapting your career and experience to meet your
  personal needs and motivation.


  You should begin to build these capabilities through opportunities _external_
  to your workplace or, workin­­­­g with your teams and/or bosses to identify
  projects they can assign you to _within_ your business that can help you
  develop in these areas. Together, they will stretch you far…

  ### Diverse networks matter


  > "Having a vibrant, diverse network will be one of your most important
  resources in seeking opportunities in your job and in being prepared for job
  changes and job searches."- Stretch, page 95


  We cannot easily develop and grow on our own. As we look to the future and
  think about ways we can remain relevant as an employee or our own boss, it’s
  important to actively practice building a diverse network. This ‘stretch’
  skill requires us to connect in new ways – extending our experience by tapping
  into the skills of others.


  “Networks are **not** the same as networking,” Mistick and Willyerd remind us.
  When referring to “networks” the authors describe the different groups we
  connect with. In contrast, they consider “networking” as the way we
  intentionally use our individual networks to develop or build personal or
  professional objectives.


  Everyone has two distinct networks:


  1.  **Personal networks (‘Close’ or ‘strong’ ties):** made up of relationships
  providing us support and friendship. People in these networks wish the best
  for us and may be inclined to stop us from taking risks.

  2.  **Professional networks (‘Loose’ ties):** these usually include business
  associates who are generally less concerned with mitigating risk on your
  behalf. Being more removed from us personally, they have a different outlook
  and usually evaluate risk more objectively.


  So how do you build diversity? Use your social networks – both online and
  offline. Your aim is to connect with people who can make a significant
  difference to your business opportunities. Discover the people who demonstrate
  confidence towards risk-taking, can provide knowledge and resources to stretch
  your existing capabilities and who can introduce you to other helpful
  connections.


  Remember! Build but balance existing and new relationships. Don’t be afraid to
  let go of connections that are not ‘stretching’ you. Adjust your network to
  suit your career progression.


  Here are some useful tips to get you started building a ‘forward-focused’
  network:


  *   Build for depth through:

  *   **Knowing:** personal relationships with a mentoring quality

  *   **Persisting:** targeting a specific person for a desired outcome

  *   **Performing:** demonstrating competence that connects you to influencers

  *   **Growing:** building individual relationships over time

  *   Bridge for breadth by:

  *   **Brokering:** matching people and needs to expand your own network

  *   **Connecting**: using your networks to get an introduction

  *   **Joining:** building a network via professional, social or cause related
  events

  *   **Sowing:** Meeting as many people as you can

  *   Identifying five people who will challenge your thinking beyond the here
  and now.

  As Yoda said, “Do or do not. There is no try”. _Stretch_ encourages us to
  consider specific experiences and learning we should undertake as employees or
  business leaders to ensure we effectively develop individually and within
  teams for tomorrow’s workplace. The message is clear. Don’t become obsolete.
  Begin stretching now. Find people inside your business or build networks that
  can positively encourage and help your personal growth.

_Stretch: How to Future-Proof Yourself for Tomorrow’s Workplace_, tackles the important question: “How do we stay relevant in our work lives”? Combining data and personal insight from surveys and interviews conducted with more than 5,500 employees and executives across 27 countries, _Stretch_ uncovers what the future workforce may expect from us.

Authors Barbara Mistick and Karie Willyerd have collaborated together on various research projects for more than a decade. Their latest research, _Workplace 2020 Survey,_ looks at shifts in the global economy and changing demographics most likely to impact career choices and how companies look to hire new talent.

They wrote _Stretch_ in response to issues and concerns they observed that employees and leaders have around the “future workplace”, which is moving at an incredible pace. Filled with practical advice, _Stretch_ helps us understand the options and capabilities we will need in order to realise our dreams and discover important career opportunities.
