  ### Use Surrogates to Increase Satisfaction with Choices


  > "This trio of studies suggests that when people are deprived of the
  information that imagination requires and are thus forced to use others as
  surrogates, they make remarkably accurate predictions about their future
  feelings, which suggests that the best way to predict our feelings tomorrow is
  to see how others are feeling today."- Stumbling on Happiness, page 251


  We spend most of our time thinking about ourselves. We think of ourselves as
  special because we can only experience our feelings. We have to infer what
  other people feel. Gilbert notes, “This tendency to think of ourselves as
  better than others is not necessarily a manifestation of our unfettered
  narcissism but may instead be an instance of a more general tendency to think
  of ourselves as _different_ from others – often for better but sometimes for
  worse.” Thinking of ourselves and others regarding differences helps us
  distinguish ourselves and others, but we tend to overestimate our unique
  qualities. Believing we are different is the main reason we reject using
  others’ experiences to predict our happiness.


  Imagining the future involves combining our perception of our present and
  memory of the past and making a prediction. Unfortunately, our perception and
  memory are biased and inaccurate models of reality. Measuring other people’s
  experience produces a better understanding of reality. Gilbert observes, “The
  irony, of course, is that surrogation is a cheap and effective way to predict
  one’s future emotions, but because we don’t realize just how similar we are,
  we reject this reliable method and rely instead on our imaginations, as flawed
  and fallible as they may be.”

  ### We Rationalize Courage More Than Cowardice


  > "Our most consequential choices – whether to marry, have children, buy a
  house, enter a profession, move abroad – are often shaped by how we imagine
  our future regrets (‘Oh no, I forgot to have a baby!’). Regret is an emotion
  we feel when we blame ourselves for unfortunate outcomes that might have been
  prevented had we only behaved differently in the past, and because that
  emotion is decidedly unpleasant, our behavior in the present is often designed
  to preclude it."- Stumbling on Happiness, page 196


  People regret not having done things much more than things they did. If we
  have a bad experience that we cannot change, we look for ways to change our
  viewpoint. We can think of the things we learned from a mistake, but if there
  was no experience we default to regret. Although eventually we rationalize
  courage more than cowardice in the present, the risk may seem exaggerated. We
  usually do not feel as bad about adverse events as we think we will.


  Using a surrogate’s experience can help evaluate options. It is very hard to
  make a balanced comparison because we tend to focus on any attribute that
  distinguishes one option from another and not on the attributes most important
  to us. We also tend to make a biased evaluation, as Gilbert writes, “when we
  are selecting, we consider the positive attributes of our alternatives, and
  when we are rejecting, we consider the negative attributes. … Of course, the
  logical way to select … is to consider both the presence and the absence of
  positive and negative attributes, but that’s not what most of us do.”


  Happiness is about feeling satisfied with our lives. Gilbert writes, “In
  short, the comparisons we make have a profound impact on our feelings, and
  when we fail to recognize that the comparisons we are making today are not the
  comparisons we will make tomorrow, we predictably underestimate how
  differently we will feel in the future.”

  ### Our Imagination has a Blind Spot


  > "The point here is when we imagine the future, we often do so in the blind
  spot of our mind’s eye, and this tendency can cause us to misimagine the
  future events whose emotional consequences we are attempting to weigh."-
  Stumbling on Happiness, page 102


  We have a tendency to misrepresent reality in our minds eye and create a blind
  spot where the future is. Because we misremember the past and misperceive the
  present, we also misimagine the future. Gilbert writes, “Because we naturally
  use our present feelings as a starting point when we attempt to predict our
  future feelings, we expect our future to be a bit more like our present than
  it actually will.” Our memories are an inaccurate representation of an event;
  they showcase rare occurrences. We also tend to compare our present to our
  imagined future and predict bad things will be worse than they are once they
  happen. Referencing a surrogate’s experience can illuminate the blind spot.


  Another type of blind spot is comparing the wrong things. We may see the value
  of savings relative to the total purchase price and not the full amount of
  money we have. We may drive across town to save five cents a gallon on
  gasoline but not to save five hundred dollars on an automobile. As Gilbert
  writes, “your bank account contains absolute dollars and not ‘percentages
  off.’” Our bank account will still have fifty cents more money when we save on
  gas and five hundred dollars more when we save on the automobile. We also may
  assess the value of purchase based on what we spent before. As in Gilbert’s
  example, “it really doesn’t matter what coffee cost the day before, the week
  before, or at any time during the Hoover administration. Right now I have
  absolute dollars to spend, and the only question I need to answer is how to
  spend them in order to maximize my satisfaction.”

  "To see is to experience the world as it is, to remember is to experience the
  world as it was, but to imagine – ah, to imagine is to experience the world as
  it isn’t and has never been, but as it might be. The greatest achievement of
  the human brain is its ability to imagine objects and episodes that do not
  exist in the realm of the real, and it is this ability that allows us to think
  about the future."

The greatest achievement of the human brain is its ability to imagine objects and episodes that do not exist in the realm of the real, and it is this ability that allows us to think about the future." _\- Stumbling on Happiness, page 5_

In _Stumbling on Happiness_, Daniel Gilbert uses engaging analogies and insightful research in explaining what makes us stumble when we predict how we will feel in the future. He supports his bold statement, _“The human being is the only animal that thinks about the future_.” It took over two million years for the one and a quarter pound brain of _Homo habilis_ to evolve to the nearly three-pound brain of _Homo sapiens_. The growth spurt that super-sized our frontal lobe is responsible for anxiety and planning, both of which involve predicting the future. Because of this remarkable adaptation he says, “We think about the future in a way that no other animal can, does, or ever has, and this simple, ubiquitous, ordinary act is a defining feature of our humanity.”

The pursuit of happiness – something which we all feel entitled to as human beings – anchors on planning a satisfying future. We make decisions to maximize satisfaction in life. Gilbert says, “Indeed, feelings don’t just matter – they are what mattering _means_.” The stumbling block is thinking we can guide our lives to a future that will make us happier than other futures. We may not be able to plan our way to a happy future and worry away the pitfalls, but there are ways we can avoid stumbling on happiness.
