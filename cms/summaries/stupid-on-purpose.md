  ### The System


  > "The System is real. It crushes dreams, discourages creativity, and
  restricts people to living under their potential…You can be different. You can
  leave The System. And if you do, you’ll be happier."- Stupid on Purpose, loc
  299


  The author introduces the idea of The System with the supposition that The
  System is bad and we should leave it. Let’s accept, for one moment, the
  existence of this insidious System. The author presupposes that the majority
  of people are drones of The System working 40 hour weeks for the next 40 (he
  actually said 50) years until retirement, when you will finally have a short
  window to enjoy life. All of us have experienced some dissatisfaction
  regarding an aspect of our lives at one point or another. This hardly makes us
  drones. This makes us human. 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals had their own
  system or way of life. Did the Neanderthal think, “I need to leave the ways of
  my tribe to be happy?” Or did happiness equate to rushing endorphins after
  successfully chasing down and eating their meal? If a Neanderthal decided to
  opt out of The System, he would have guaranteed his demise. Compared to them,
  our lives are remarkably easier; we no longer have to chase and overpower our
  food. The System also evolved with us. It kept our ancestors in the past and
  our families today, alive. In both cases, The System guarantees survival. So
  now that we don’t have to run after prey, we’re free to contemplate the
  absurdity of working 40 years at jobs we hate. In contrast, our
  great-grandparents didn’t question The System, having experienced its
  disruption: the privation of the Great Depression and inhumanity of the Second
  World War.


  The author talks about leaving The System, not in some grandiose, extreme way,
  but by changing one small thing at a time. It’s not always about the big
  things like quitting a relationship or job. Maybe it’s turning off your
  Blackberry on a Friday night during dinner and drinks. There’s nothing stupid
  about that. Unless you’re on call.

  ### The System preserves itself by perpetuating 13 lies


  > "Not only does The System want you to act the same as everyone else, they
  want you to think the same way as everyone else."- Stupid on Purpose, loc 358


  According to the author, there are thirteen lies. Here are three:


  **Your Job Should Be “Work”**


  I performed a quick experiment in a public place. I asked 20 people the
  following question: _If you had the option of quitting your job and never
  having to work another day in your life_… _would you take it?_ The answer was
  yes in every case. Their jobs range from executive roles to cashiers at
  grocery stores. All of them wanted to do something else or have more time
  doing things they enjoyed. If we did what we loved and got paid for it, we
  wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world. So what’s stopping us?


  **Relaxation is a… Sin**


  How many of us feel guilty at not responding to an email the second it comes
  in? Or answered emails while on vacation? Having a Blackberry is both a
  convenience and a curse. The message is clear: Set boundaries so you can enjoy
  the moment.


  **Work Should Be Your Top Priority**


  The author quotes an excerpt from Gary Keller’s [_The One
  Thing_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-one-thing/)_:_
  “_In life we… juggle 5 balls: family, friends, hobbies, religion, and work.
  It’s a struggle to keep all 5 balls up in the air at the same time… something
  might come up and you’ll accidentally drop a ball. But here’s the thing: work
  is a rubber ball. It can bounce back. The other 4 balls are made of glass.”_


  For the last two years I chose work as my top priority above family and
  friends. I am grateful that my glass balls did not shatter. It’s safe to say
  that I’ve gotten my priorities straight this time.

  ### We experience eight stages in The System


  > "\[The System is\] a set of rules… an unspoken (societal) agreement."-
  Stupid on Purpose, loc 158


  When you deviate from the plan, those around you will “freak out.” My sister
  announced over dinner one night, years ago, that she was dropping out of
  university. Plates went flying. Why? Because we’re supposed to follow The
  System; all 8 stages of it.


  **Stage 1:** You are born, raised, and socialized  

  **Stages 2-4:** You’re in elementary, high school, and college  

  **Stage 5-6:** Job hunting and getting the job  

  **Stage 7-8:** Retirement and ultimately death


  You might have noticed the author missing certain milestones such as buying
  your first home, marrying your childhood/college sweetheart as well as perhaps
  having children. If you do marry, have children and a mortgage, good luck
  telling your spouse that you’re quitting your job.


  Some end up working for the same company for a decade or more. The company
  becomes The System. Deciding to leave The System, your decision is met with
  curiosity, anxiety, and sometimes pity by those remaining in it. The objective
  is to be a “Lifer” because for them, there is no life outside The System.


  In either case, it will take an enormous leap of faith to break free, follow
  your dreams and live your full potential.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Stupid on Purpose_ is published as a Kindle e-book which costs $1.44. It is
  written in colloquial English and will take an hour of your life. Though I
  enjoyed reading it, I found it to be full of generalities and fraught with
  ideas borrowed from other sources. Though not necessarily lacking in some
  truth, I felt that it was written within a narrow prism which lacks depth in
  both experience and perspective. It may not completely surprise you that the
  author is a 16-year-old, homeschooled, self-published writer. He ends his book
  with an invitation to join The Impossible Club for $5 a month for a limited
  time.

> "Do you seriously want to spend the rest of your life coming home from a job you hate? Do you want to put off your hopes and dreams and passions to pursue a ‘normal life’?" _\- Stupid on Purpose, loc 314_

Mark Messick’s _Stupid on Purpose: The Art of Ignoring Good Advice, Doing Whatever the Heck You Want, and Actually Enjoying Your Life_ is about existential awareness and having the courage to make changes in pursuit of doing what makes us happy.

It starts with a story about Izzy Arkin who hated his zombie-like, trapped existence until he made a decision to quit his job and follow his dream to become a ninja. Predictably, everyone said he was being stupid. He didn’t know martial arts, didn’t speak Japanese, and he had no money. Yet, six years later, he became a real ninja. He became what he’s always dreamed of because he chose to be stupid on purpose.

Warning: Read with an open mind.

If you’re interested in a more thorough commentary on The System, you’ll do better reading _Catch-22_ by Joseph Heller, _The Giver_ by Lois Lowry, or watching _The Matrix_.
