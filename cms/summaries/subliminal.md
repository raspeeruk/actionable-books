  ### Motivated Reasoning


  > "The ‘causal arrow’ in human thought processes consistently tends to point
  from belief to evidence, not vice versa."- Subliminal, page 201


  The most valuable part of this book is at the very end: the topic of Motivated
  Reasoning. Humans may self-conceive as being rational agents, but we were not
  optimized to be objective or logical about things. What most people think they
  do is use evidence to come to a conclusion; to decide what to do or what to
  believe by considering the facts. **What we actually do most of the time is we
  have an opinion or belief and then we make the “facts” to support it.** This
  is an excellent strategy for lawyers, but it’s something to be aware of if
  you’re actually attempting to approach something impassionedly.


  There are many reasons that people use motivated reasoning. One is to feel
  good. There are many ways motivated reasoning does this: One obvious case is
  favouring positive evidence about our own abilities—**94% of people believe
  they’re an above-average driver** (i.e. better than half of other drivers).
  It’s hard to simply decide to be realistic in one’s self-assessment. Similarly
  for sports teams, or courts of law, or simply assessing the methodologies of
  studies: **we will, without intending to, favour information that favours our
  pre-existing beliefs.**


  The best way to combat that is to attempt to separate evidence from
  conclusion. Read the methodology of a scientific study and decide how much you
  support it _before_ you look too deeply into the conclusion. If testing
  yourself on a number of skills or traits, decide which you value most before
  you find out your personal scores. This isn’t always easy or even possible,
  but it’s the only way to thwart this kind of motivated reasoning. Otherwise
  it’s too late.


  Also, on a more abstract/meta level: motivated reasoning provides a mechanism
  to avoid being wrong in general, but since most people are uncomfortable with
  being wrong, motivated reasoning also causes itself. Action: be grateful for
  when you’re wrong. Pat yourself on the back. **Admitting you used to be wrong
  is an important part of being right.**

  ### Group Norm Reminders


  > "Remember! Binge drinking is prevalent on campus!"- Subliminal, page 171


  People tend to behave the way other people behave. We’re social creatures.
  However, we sometimes have conflicting messages about what group norms are,
  which can lead to unintended consequences for anyone trying to influence
  behaviour of others. Consider this case mentioned in _Subliminal_:


  Researchers created a sign condemning the fact that many visitors steal the
  wood from Petrified Forest National Park. They placed the sign on a well-used
  pathway \[…\] They found that in the absence of a sign, souvenir hunters stole
  about 3% of the wood pieces in just a ten-hour period. But with the warning
  sign, that number almost tripled, to 8 percent.


  What sociologists and neuroscientists have found is that in many cases, public
  service announcements designed to prevent a behaviour end up increasing its
  incidence rate by drawing attention to the fact that many other people are
  doing it. This causes others to behave the same way because it establishes a
  norm for the group. This is a valuable point for anyone in marketing or
  advertising: **it’s much more effective to promote the behaviours you _do_
  want.**

  ### Visual Dominance Ratio


  > "As in other primate societies, gaze direction and stare are important
  signals of dominance in human society."- Subliminal, page 120


  How is eye-contact related to social dominance? Take a guess right now.
  (You’re much more likely to remember what I tell you if you attempt your own
  answer first.)


  First, the average amount of eye-contact made varies per person and appears to
  not be notably related to social dominance. Instead, **what matters is the
  ratio of looking-at-the-other-person-while-speaking and
  looking-at-the-other-person-while-listening**, called the _visual dominance
  ratio_. (Feel free to change your hypothesis right now if this point makes it
  irrelevant.)


  What scientists have concluded is that dominant people (and other primates)
  look at their conversational partner more while speaking than listening. They
  have a visual dominance ratio around 1.0 or higher. If your visual dominance
  ratio is instead more like 0.6, you are probably feeling subordinate in some
  way. This is where the parent-child admonishment, “Look at me when I’m talking
  to you!” comes from. That instruction is an assertion of the parent’s
  dominance in the social hierarchy.


  **Knowing this is valuable, because it allows you to shift your implicit place
  in the social hierarchy.** Note that in some situations it may be advantageous
  to show submission: if you don’t want to appear too competitive to your boss;
  or if you want to reduce someone else’s feelings of insecurity, or put them at
  ease.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Subliminal_ is a very comprehensive introduction to the world of the
  unconscious mind. Most of the book isn’t particularly actionable, but valuable
  for demonstrating how much of human thought occurs for reasons other than the
  ones we think.
f_quote-2: >-
  "We ask ourselves or our friends questions like ‘Why do you drive that car?’
  or ‘Why do you like that guy?’ or ‘Why did you laugh at that joke?’ Research
  suggests that we think we know the answers to such questions but really we
  often don’t."

> "We ask ourselves or our friends questions like ‘Why do you drive that car?’ or ‘Why do you like that guy?’ or ‘Why did you laugh at that joke?’ Research suggests that we think we know the answers to such questions but really we often don’t." _\- Subliminal, page 7_

**You are not your whole brain.** That is to say, the “you” that is your conscious mind, whose workings you can directly access, makes up only part of your mental processes. The other part, or “unconscious mind” makes (or at least affects) many of your decisions, leaving you only able to guess about how or why.

It’s worth noting that the model of unconscious being presented is from the field of social neuroscience, rather than the poorly defined “subconscious” which originated in Freudian psychology. That is, this is _not_ about weird effects your childhood might have had on you, but about the effect that everyday subliminal (i.e. below the threshold of consciousness) messages (from advertisements, but also factors as simple as body language) have on your unconscious mind and therefore your conscious thoughts and decisions as well.
