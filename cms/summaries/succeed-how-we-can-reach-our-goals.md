  ### Pump up that Self-Control muscle


  > "Use it or lose it. Your self-control muscle is just like the other muscles
  in your body. When it doesn’t get much exercise it becomes weaker over time.
  But when you give it regular workouts by putting it to good use, it will grow
  stronger and stronger and better able to help you successfully reach your
  goals."- Succeed, page 194


  Halverson provides several ways to exercise our self-control so it is ready
  for the avalanche of obstacles that we face when trying to reach our goals.
  One of her suggestions is to take on a small challenge such as standing up
  straight or doing 100 sit-ups a day. The act of consciously trying to do this
  will reinforce our willpower and enable us to tackle bigger tasks.


  Besides giving it a regular workout, we can also boost our discipline by
  observing or thinking of a person we know that has lots of willpower. She
  calls this **contagion**, the act of influencing from watching. An additional
  self-control boost is anything that enhances our mood. She describes a study
  in which participants were given a small gift (a reward) following a difficult
  task. The reward boosted their self-control reserves, allowing them to perform
  an additional unpleasant task.


  But similar to our muscles, self-control can get depleted if it is
  over-worked. We shouldn’t attempt too many goals at the same time, such as
  working out and dieting. Our willpower can be overwhelmed by too many demands
  at the same time. “Immediately after you’ve put it to the test, you will be
  more vulnerable than you usually are to temptations, distractions and other
  pitfalls that can throw you off track.”


  She goes on to explain that most people fall prey to their weaknesses (such as
  overeating or not working out) at the end of the day, once they’ve exhausted
  their self-control reserve. Knowing this, we can plan ahead for these
  potential self-control traps and set-up a strategy such as If-Then plans to
  alleviate such bad influences.

  ### Focus on improvement not perfection


  > "When we focus on getting better, we take difficulty in stride—using our
  experiences to fuel our improvement. People who pursue growth often turn in
  their best performances because they are far more resilient in the face of
  challenges."- Succeed, page 75


  Halverson breaks down the types of goals people usually set into two types:
  **proving yourself (be good)** and **improving yourself (get better)**. Be
  good goals are about trying to prove yourself, such as how smart you are at
  school or work when compared to everyone else. Get better goals are about
  self-mastery. It’s not about a particular outcome, but more about improvement
  and how much progress has been made. Based on her research, it seems that
  people who set get-better goals have more resilience and perseverance.


  Focusing on getting better goals allows us to handle challenges and obstacles
  much better, providing another boost to our self-control muscle. “When the
  road gets rocky, people who are focused on proving themselves tend to conclude
  that they don’t have what it takes-and give up way too soon.”

  ### Make If-Then plans to help with goal execution


  > "Planning when, where and how you will take the actions needed to reach your
  goal is probably the single most effective thing you can do to increase your
  chances of success."- Succeed, page 177


  No goal is achievable without a plan. Spelling out exactly what needs to be
  done along with how and when can greatly increase your chances of success.
  Many times the biggest obstacle to achieving our goals is seizing the
  opportunity to act. Halverson’s solution to this obstacle is setting up
  If-Then plans, which work as follows: If I am in this situation, then I will
  take this action. An example would be: If it is 6 p.m. on Monday, then I will
  go to the gym.


  According to the author, If-Then plans work because they help us seize the
  moment. Creating these specific strategies helps our brain to detect when
  opportunities arise in the day to act on our goals. Studies performed by her
  and other researchers confirmed that setting up these If-Then plans
  dramatically increases the odds of reaching our targets.


  If-Then planning also “conserves our most precious motivational resource: our
  self-control strength. Anytime our unconscious mind can take over, detecting
  situations and directing our behavior without conscious effort, it is far less
  taxing and requires less willpower.”

  So before skipping that next workout, create an If-Then plan and seize the
  opportunity. Reach for this invaluable book if you’re serious about achieving
  your goals and making this year count. “You can be more successful in reaching
  your goals than you have been in the past. Make success happen.”

Who hasn’t set a New Year’s resolution at the beginning of the year, only to be disappointed a few weeks later at the difficulty and challenges involved in following through? We’d like to believe that this year will be different and we’ll be more committed and persevere through the temptations of skipping a workout or having that extra slice of stuffed pizza. Well, after reading Heidi Grant Halverson’s book, _Succeed: How We Can Reach Our Goals_, this time really can be different.

Dr. Halverson is a social psychologist whose research on motivation and goal-setting makes her highly qualified to provide suggestions as to what works and what doesn’t. Her book is a practical how-to guide with hands-on advice on increasing our chances for hitting our targets.
