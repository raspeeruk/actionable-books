  ### Embrace the Six Promises or Committments


  > "One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest
  on themselves. You don’t choose your passions; your passions choose you."-
  Jeff Bezos, Success on Your Own Terms, page 17


  The heart of the book is built on six promises or commitments you can make to
  live your passion and have a meaningful, self-directed career. Here’s a bird’s
  eye view:


  1.  **Embrace your passion**. Don’t discount your dreams. Revive them.
  Identify what you truly care about, what values you hold, and what your life
  and career goals are. In some ways, this step could be the easiest, and in
  some ways, this could be the toughest.

  2.  **Perform to progress versus perfection**. Perfection is paralyzing,
  celebrate the progress you make. You’ll feel energized to keep making more
  progress.

  3.  **Promote with purpose.** Let people know who you are in a way that is
  authentic and purposeful. Craft and hone your personal story. There’s no one
  else in the world like you with your unique blend of experiences, skills, and
  talents.

  4.  **Parlay your platform**. Your station in life is comprised of all your
  experiences and skills. You’ll get a chance to parlay your platform when you
  are promoting yourself with purpose.

  5.  **Put it into action**. Luckily for you, opportunity knocks not just once,
  but many times. You’ll have ample opportunity to practice these commitments
  you’ve made as you traverse the pool of career choices**.** None of these
  promises to yourself mean anything if you don’t act on it.

  6.  **Practice philanthropy.** Not just with your money but also with your
  time and talent. Align your philanthropy to what you are truly passionate
  about.

  ### Treat Networking like a Second Job.


  > "If you are the only one who can speak on your behalf, you are probably in
  trouble."- Success on Your Own Terms, page 131


  You’ll need people on your team. Next to having a mentor and coach, networking
  is another key arsenal in your toolkit. If you’re like a lot of people who
  dislike networking, start easy. Start within the company: eat lunch with
  someone in another department to get to know them better, or use this time to
  connect with members of your own team. Take advantage of various internal
  meetings like lunch-and-learns. Stay in touch with colleagues who have moved
  on to other roles.


  According to a report from ABC news, 80% of today’s jobs are found through
  networking. The hard fact is that employees who are known in some way to their
  future employer are perceived as being better hires.


  It is equally important to schedule standing meetings (or coffee) with certain
  key people: quarterly, monthly and annually to maintain a healthy connection
  with key people you’ve met.

  ### Embrace Lateral Career Moves to Achieve Growth


  > "It is so important not to gravitate toward the bright, shiny objects such
  as chasing money or titles."- Success on Your Own Terms, Page 96


  Chase skills and experiences instead of just linear advancement. Sure, more
  money and a better title is always welcome, but should not be your sole
  motivator. Money and title won’t help you if you hate what you’re doing, if
  you’re not learning, or if the role is not aligned to your values. The author
  stresses the importance of having a developmental plan as part of your master
  plan. After you’ve identified your goals, identify skill gaps you’ll need to
  close, and actively seek career opportunities that will help you close these
  gaps.


  For example, if you’re looking to become the head of a company one day, you’ll
  need to understand the business in its entirety. If you’ve worked in different
  pillars of the company but have no experience in revenue generation, as was
  the case with the author at one point in his career, you can choose to close
  this gap by purposefully seeking a role in that area. The author identified a
  downside to this—if you’re already at senior executive level, you might need
  to take a role in the directorship level. The title and pay might not be where
  you want it. Stay true to your plan, and these things will come.


  There’s also another option.


  Switching organizations or industries can allow you to grow and round out your
  experiences and skills. This is better than a status quo in your current role
  if you’re stagnating. As much as the author dissuades from chasing money and
  titles, switching companies or industries can also come with better pay.
  You’re learning, gaining experience and you’re getting better paid while doing
  so. Often, the longer you stay in one company, the raises you’re given are
  only cost of living allowances and not really what you’re worth. You gain
  better negotiating power if you have the flexibility in your plan to make the
  shift.
f_conclusion: >-
  At 205 pages, this book was an easy read. I was drawn to this book initially
  because I wanted to know how to pursue my passion points, how to make the leap
  from careerist to entrepreneurship. Perhaps, this book should be more aptly
  titled _Successfully Managing your Career_. It’s not so much about pursuing
  your passions as it is about climbing the career ladder.

> “Life is too long not to be spending it doing something that you are genuinely passionate about.” _\- Success on Your Own Terms, page 15_

Passion is defined by Merriam Webster as an intense desire or enthusiasm for something. Its synonyms are fervour, ardour, zeal, enthusiasm, mania, fascination, obsession…you get it.

After polling 25 million employees in 189 countries, Gallup found that **only 13%** of workers around the globe feel a sense of passion for their work. What about the other 87%? The vast majority at 63% are unhappy and checked out. The other 24% completely hate their jobs.

You know which category you fall under, even if you didn’t partake in the survey. The world is rife with horrible bosses and company culture, sure. Still, we cannot blame our dissatisfaction solely on them. We, alone, are responsible for our career choices.

_Success on Your Own Terms: 6 Promises to Fire Up Your Passion, Ignite Your Career, and Create an Amazing Life_ by James B. Rosseau, Sr. is your guidebook to managing your career and stoking passion for what you do. The author frames passion within the context of a career—manage your career so you can utilize it as a vehicle to pursue what you’re truly passionate about. In the author’s case, he’s passionate about helping others.

The book is rich with “oldies but goodies”: advice you might have come across in other books you’ve read. A few examples are building and working your network, getting a mentor, becoming a mentor to others, getting coaching and feedback, and more. The author shares personal anecdotes at every stage of his career to demonstrate how you, too, can live the six promises and live a richer, fuller life.
