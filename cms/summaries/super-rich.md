  ### Redefine Rich: Need Nothing


  > "When you have a rich spirit, you’re already rich. You won’t need anything
  else. When you can be happy and comfortable in every position, or situation,
  that you encounter in life, then all the obstacles that you perceive as
  standing between you and happiness will gradually disappear. It will become
  easier to fill your life with friendship, laughter, love, and yes, for those
  who still desire it, money."- Super Rich


  “That’s easy for the rich guy to say,” jokes Russell Simmons after explaining
  his definition of being super rich. Odds are that’s what you thought to
  yourself, too. But as you read _Super Rich_, and you learn more about Simmons
  and the journey that has made him so successful, his definition seems anything
  but disingenuous. I gave you a brief rundown of Simmons’ impressive CV in his
  own words in the opening. You may have noticed that for all his incredible
  achievements, Simmons comes across as fairly modest. You may **not** have
  noticed that his description is devoid of superlatives. (Go back and take a
  look – totally fact based) Instead, his focus is on joy he experienced in the
  _creation process_; that’s where the true richness came from. “The happiness I
  received,” writes Simmons, “and continue to receive, from those records is
  what makes me rich. Not the money I made from selling them.”


  When Simmons was pushing the Hip-Hop group, Run DMC in the early 80s, it was
  not out of a desire for fame and fortune; it was purely to bring his passion
  for the Hip-Hop genre to as many people as would listen.


  As I write more and more summaries for Actionable, I’ve noticed a common
  denominator that runs through each of the books I have read: _passion_.
  Whether we’re talking about the success of Martha Stewart, or Russell Simmons,
  passion was key. Without passion, Simmons simply would not have had the desire
  nor the drive to bring the music he loved – the music that changed his life –
  to as wide an audience as he did. Sure, fame and fortune, and yes, the
  material possessions, came along with that success, but those weren’t the
  driving forces; they were merely the by-products of his passion.

  ### Attitude Adjustment


  > "One thing that holds many people back from becoming great workers is a
  misguided belief that only certain jobs are worth of their “A game,” or
  maximum effort."- Super Rich


  Right now few of us are exactly where we want to be in our careers. However,
  every job you do is a step on the ladder towards the top, that top rung being
  where you ultimately hope to see yourself. Nevertheless, as Simmons points
  out, very few of us look at it that way, and not acknowledging this is very
  detrimental to one’s success. Therefore, as many of us might consider
  redefining our understanding of “rich”, we might also need to adjust the way
  we perceive our current career status.


  Each job we do is an endeavour that should be performed to the best of our
  ability, in order to glean all we can and grow into the person we want to be.
  Simmons cited a young man who came up to him and asked for advice on
  fulfilling his dream to become a movie star. Simmons said that if he really
  wanted to be successful, he would have to hop on the next bus and head out to
  LA; he wouldn’t make it as a movie star anywhere else. Appeals that he didn’t
  have enough money at that moment were dismissed by Simmons. His advice was to
  take whatever job he could to support himself on his auditions when he got to
  LA.


  Simmons later heard from the hopeful actor who started his new life scooping
  ice cream in upscale Beverly Hills. Although he wasn’t employed in his dream
  job, each ice cream was served with a smile and some friendly banter. In fact,
  the young man so impressed one customer – the manager of the Beverly Hills,
  Ralph Lauren – that he was quickly offered a job there. Again, he wasn’t
  acting in a film that would get his name in lights, but he was getting closer.
  Through his new job, he was allowed to borrow clothes for auditions and
  networking events. It was networking at a premiere that he was ‘discovered’ by
  director Brett Ratner who was so impressed that he hired the man for a
  television pilot. And to think, it all started with scooping ice cream with
  passion.

  ### Give It (Until They Can't Live Without It)


  > "If you ain’t giving away your gift, then you ain’t in the game. And if you
  ain’t in the game, then you’re never going to win."- Super Rich


  Simmons advocates that if you have a passion for something, and you’re having
  trouble making money off it, give it away for nothing. Give it away until the
  public can’t live without it. That’s precisely what he did with Kurtis Blow.
  In the early 1980s, Hip-Hop wasn’t mainstream, and didn’t dominate the charts
  like it does now. In fact, it was viewed as a fad that would quickly die out.
  (The idea of artist, Lil Wayne selling nearly a million copies of _Tha Carter
  IV_, as he did this past week, thirty years later, would have been
  unfathomable.)


  Simmons writes: “At that time the labels were only looking for records similar
  to chart toppers like Prince’s ‘When Doves Cry,’ or Lionel Richie’s ‘All Night
  Long.’ These were the types of records the labels though would sell and, as a
  result, were the only types of records they wanted to invest their money in.”
  So what did Russell Simmons do? He gave the music away for free. He gave free
  copies to DJs who might play it on the radio, and each night he’d hit the
  clubs and got them to spin it there. The patrons were enjoying the record.
  That much was immediately obvious to Simmons who could see their reactions.
  But Simmons knew that it would take more creativity to get an even wider
  audience. He had new copies of the record pressed, this time emblazoned with
  Polygram’s logo.


  Polygram execs was confused when they were suddenly inundated with calls from
  record stores looking for more records by “Kurtis Blow”, an artist they had
  never heard of… despite the fact he supposedly signed to their label. Polygram
  finally tracked Blow down and handed him a record contract, all because of
  Russell Simmons’ ingenuity.


  For a more recent example, Simmons cites Drake, who created buzz by releasing
  his music online for nothing. A war to sign him between several labels ensued.
  Justin Bieber is another artist who only a few years ago had aspirations for
  the big time. He posted videos on YouTube and caught the eye of both Usher and
  Justin Timberlake, two superstars in the music industry. Bieber signed up with
  Usher and the rest, as they say, is history. But giving away your product for
  free isn’t limited to the music industry. If you’re a writer, start a blog.
  You get the idea. Just get your product out there.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Super Rich: A Guide to Having it All_ is a quick, but inspiring read. Each
  page is so infused with Russell Simmons’ larger-than-life personality that
  reading the book feels more like an intimate conversation with a friend (who
  just happens to be a hugely successful mogul!) than a stuffy book. Some
  readers’ own beliefs may not align with Simmons’, who is a devout yogi and, as
  such, regularly references the teachings and beliefs of this practice in his
  book. Interestingly, Simmons credits yoga with much of his past and present
  success. As he writes: “If… you can accept that the toys and the money will
  only be the by-products, instead of the aim, of your journey toward
  enlightenment, then you will have positioned yourself to be truly rich. To
  realize your greatest potential.” In fact, you’ll become Super Rich.

  living in a state of consciousness where you’re able to see the miracles of
  life unfolding in front of you all time."

Even if you don’t immediately recognize the name Russell Simmons, don’t be surprised if you’ve crossed paths with some of his success stories.

Simon’s explains: “I was the guy who helped put hip-hop music on the map by co-founding Def Jam Records and introducing artists like Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Ludacris, DMX, and Jay-Z to mainstream America. Who found subsequent success through ventures like _Def Comedy Jam_, _Def Poetry Jam_, Phat Farm clothing, and _Run’s House_. Who over time eared the title of ‘the Godfather of Hip-Hop,’ as well as one I’m a little more comfortable with, ‘Uncle Rush.’”

The Hip-Hop lifestyle is synonymous with opulence. Cristal champagne, a fleet of Rolls-Royces in the driveway, jewellery by Van Cleef & Arpels, and homes on both coasts. As, “the Godfather of Hip-Hop”, Russell Simmons is no exception. So it was with some astonishment as I began reading Simmons’ second book, _Super Rich: A Guide to Having it All_, that I quickly discovered that Simmons’ idea of “having it all” isn’t at all what I thought it would be.
