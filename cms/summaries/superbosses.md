  ### Hiring like a superboss


  > "When it comes to hiring, superbosses make their own rules. They forge their
  own path."- Superbosses, page 39


  Superbosses are looking for recruits that are not just smart and talented—they
  want unusually talented, startlingly gifted recruits who are willing to drive
  change or, as Finkelstein describes, “they get it”. Getting it can mean
  various things for different industries, but broadly includes the following:


  *   **Unusual intelligence:** Nearly all superbosses place an emphasis on
  everyone being as smart as possible. They determine this by nonconventional
  interview techniques and job trials.

  *   **Creativity:** Superbosses want to know how potential employees think.
  It’s not necessary that recruits think as they would as they like to learn
  from others.

  *   **Flexibility:** Superbosses are often not interested in specialists. They
  want expertise in many areas and will at times move people around
  responsibilities to encourage flexibility.


  So how does one hire like a superboss if you are a manager or in HR?
  Finkelstein fortunately believes all of us can learn from superbosses and
  adopt some strategies with caution.


  1.  Firstly, resist the urge to throw out resumes solely on past experience
  and credentials. Don’t eliminate job criterion entirely but remain aware that
  you may be missing the very best creative candidates

  2.  Feel free to loosen up the formal interview by holding them in an unusual
  place and by asking different questions. Be more creative in your selection
  process.

  3.  See employee turnover as a positive thing, especially if they are moving
  ahead or branching out on their own.

  4.  Become proud and not jealous of your awesome team.

  5.  Hire great people or don’t hire at all.

  6.  Take a punt on exceptional candidates even if no job exists.

  7.  Be constantly on the lookout for talent everywhere you go.

  ### The Cohort Effect


  > "For superbosses, extreme collaboration and meaningful competition aren’t
  opposites; they go hand in hand."- Superbosses, page 152


  Finkelstein gives several examples of companies managed by superbossses where
  teamwork and deliberate competition were encouraged, such as the Motown record
  label, run by superboss Berry Gordy, where new “raw” talents were not only
  coached but also participated in weekly quality control and product evaluation
  meetings. Gordy also started a finishing school, teaching musicians both
  social and presentation skills, which many of them lacked. The standards
  expected were exacting but Gordy’s methods of leadership also allowed freedom
  of expression, confidence, collegiality and less fear of making mistakes. The
  result were astonishing. Most artists became close friends, playing basketball
  together, eating together, and most becoming lifetime friends. The competitive
  side was intense, but rather than being destructive, it became a challenge to
  improve as Stevie Wonder reflected in the book. “It was a challenge to come up
  with great music, great songs. And to me that was cool.” The record label sold
  millions of records.


  How can you jump start the cohort effect in your business? Perhaps by sharing
  ideas between management and employees, delegating responsibilities more,
  public recognition of great work and sharing the credit. Also, structure work
  as to encourage competition recognizing both collaboration and competition.
  Small ideas we have at our work include weekly yoga classes, monthly social
  events, training, and even small rewards for individual productivity.

  ### Playbook


  > "Applying superboss practice isn't always easy, but if we actively
  disseminate them, we can give work the incredible meaning and vitality that it
  should have but all too frequently does not."- Superbosses, page 200


  Finkelstein outlines a superboss quotient which gives great insight into what
  one must change to become a superboss.


  1.  Do you have a specific vision for your work that energizes you and your
  team? Could all of your employees answer the “why do we exist” question?

  2.  Do you employ by non-traditional methods or use a cookie cutter approach?

  3.  How often do people leave your team for a bigger offer elsewhere? What is
  that like for both you and the team—does it make you upset?

  4.  Does your team push for other goals, other than formal ones?

  5.  How do you go about questioning your assumptions about the business and
  within your team?

  6.  How do you balance the need to delegate and the amount of time needed for
  hands on coaching?

  7.  When promoting employees do you put people in jobs where they may
  potentially fail, and how do you deal with that if it occurs?

  8.  What is the connection between members of the team? Is there healthy
  competition as well as collaboration?

  9.  Do you keep in touch with past employees?

  10.  Have any past employees gone on to noteworthy careers?

  11.  What is the culture like in respect to nurturing versus getting the job
  done?


  Adapting a superboss playbook is possible, and if you put away your excuses
  and concentrate on what suits your style there is no reason why we all can’t
  adopt some of their strategies. For instance, making sure employees understand
  the vision for your company and encouraging them in more inspirational ways.
  Look for ways to foster more collegiality between employees and be more
  forgiving if their new “great” idea didn’t quite work out.

> "Superbosses are the great coaches, the igniters of talent, and the teachers of leadership in most industries. In effect, superbosses have mastered something most bosses miss---a path to extraordinary success founded on making other people successful." _\- Superbosses, page 14-15_

Sydney Finkelstein embarked on a 10 year research project dissecting and collating stories and data on eighteen primary “superbosses”. The result, _Superbosses_, gives us a managerial handbook of leadership that yields a fresh set of answers to recruit, inspire, motivate and coach “an inexhaustible pipeline of rising stars.”

Superbosses possess many similarities; extreme confidence bordering on fearlessness, extreme competitiveness, visionary, integrity and authenticity. They inspire people around them through their exuberant personalities. Their personalities generally fall into one of three types:

1.  **Glorious Bastards:** A focus on winning at all costs, mainly by driving their people to excess.
2.  **Nurturers:** These bosses are typical of a traditional mentor; they take pride in guiding others which is their ultimate success.
3.  **Iconoclasts:** A single minded passion for their industry or work that inspires others, usually in creative fields.

*   Creative hiring
