  ### Determination + Goal-setting + Concentration = Success


  > "Determination? Goal-setting? Concentration? We all think we have them. But
  the truth is, we don’t."- Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive, page
  244


  Mackay describes trying to speak to professional golfer Gary Player while he
  was practicing. “He didn’t break stride. He didn’t turn his head. His eyes
  stayed focused on the horizon. He had blinders on. His response could be
  etched in stone.” This is what it looks like to be determined and to
  concentrate on a goal. Player was a South African who won dozens of
  championships over three decades in spite of formidable obstacles. He needed
  to play with four bodyguards in the 1960’s because of racial bias, and he
  battled major health problems.


  Mackay said most people think they are as single minded and committed as
  Player but nine out of ten are not. You can develop it with practice and
  perseverance and become unstoppable. He also points out that people who
  singularly focus on success are not pleasant to be around and may find
  themselves often looking for (and finding) new opportunities. A measure of
  balance is prudent here. The The Big Idea is that when we find ourselves
  failing to turn that into success the first step is to evaluate honestly if we
  are 100% engaged.


  How do you know? If you are earnestly setting goals and not reaching them,
  Mackay’s formula for success says you need to increase your concentration and
  determination. To find out how read on to the Insights.

  ### Fantasize


  > "I saw it in my mind’s eye a thousand times. And, of course, I finally did
  it… I came to realize that fantasizing, projecting yourself into successful
  situations, is one of the most powerful means there is to achieve personal
  goals."- Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive, page 63


  Mackay is describing reaching his goal of building a much-needed new stadium
  and being the one to throw out the first ball. He set his goal and planned to
  build it in one year. It actually took seven years and everything went wrong,
  but he did it. He kept that image in his mind the entire time. I like this
  example, visualizing a simple symbol of success to reach a goal. The actual
  goal is a large complex project. The simple image could be conjured at any
  point when he might feel like giving up.


  Planning and setting goals is a logical activity that takes effort. Carrying
  out those plans takes emotional effort. Thinking is logical but doing is
  emotional. When extensive logical planning drains energy often, the doing is
  undone. Your brain does not have enough energy left to override the default
  easy action that undermines the most difficult action that helps you reach the
  goal. Simply visualizing doing something you could not do without reaching
  your goal is like getting an advance on the emotional payoff of your
  accomplishment. It provides the needed energy to keep going when you want to
  give up. Fantasizing is like pressing the determination button instead of the
  easy button.

  ### Activity ≠ Efficiency


  > "Don’t equate activity with efficiency… They are probably doing the company
  a lot more good than anything else they could be doing. They’re thinking. It’s
  the hardest, most valuable task any person performs. It’s what helped get you
  where you are. THINK: that’s the one-word motto that Thomas J. Watson brought
  to IBM decades ago… THINK! Don’t stifle it. Encourage it."- Swim with the
  Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive, page 141


  It does not take any skill to snap a whip and point at a goal board. It does
  take skill to distinguish between wasting time and productive thought. This
  quote is about employee engagement and about what makes an activity useful.
  Doing the work the right way often requires some thought. Putting thought into
  a project or endeavor can be the difference between a success and a failure.


  Mackay uses Einstein as an example of someone intensely centered on productive
  thought. “Let me add that Einstein couldn’t remember his own phone number.
  ‘Why should I bother,’ he said, ‘when I can look it up?’ The things he did
  remember, nobody could look up unless Einstein himself wrote them down.” That
  is real concentration. Although your goal might not be to be to become that
  focused, it is a great example of how possibilities open up with focused
  thought.


  We have a human need to feel important and a cultural obsession with keeping
  busy. The time that we invest in social fanfare showing our busy work far from
  proves we are important and valuable. Busyness is not an accurate measure of
  employee engagement either. Unfortunately, just working does not translate
  into meeting meaningful goals. Success comes from the hard work that no one
  sees because it goes on in your head. It is the prerequisite to quality
  successful activity. If you are determined to reach your goals, take the time
  to think and learn before you plan and do.

  This summary is only a taste of what this book has to offer. I chose to
  summarize Mackay’s formula for success because it was the most important thing
  for me to put into action this month. I took on the challenge of making some
  career changes so that I could take advantage of opportunities that interested
  me. As it often is with new challenges, I have a very large amount of
  information to learn and many new ideas to explore plus all the things I am
  doing differently. It is easy to become overwhelmed but putting into practice
  these ideas helped me a lot. I look forward to using more of the information
  in this book.

  "Most sales manuals will tell you that the most important thing you are
  selling is yourself. This book won’t. In my opinion, selling yourself can
  sometimes be a very bad idea… because very often, my friend, you and I are
  lousy products. Our challenge, whether we are salespeople, or negotiators, or
  managers, or entrepreneurs, is to make others see the advantage to themselves
  in responding to our proposal. Understanding our subjects’ personalities is
  vital. Let them shine. Our own personalities are subordinate."

The punchy and engaging _Swim with the Sharks Without Being Eaten Alive_ published in 2005 is an update to _Swim with the Sharks_ first published in 1988 which went on to sell 4 million copies. Harvey Mackay lives up to his reputation with this solid advice on salesmanship, negotiation, and management. It is broken down into 69 Concise Lessons, 19 Quickies and special chapters in the back with advice on helping your children succeed and ensuring _your_ success. This is a 100% actionable book and your performance will improve immediately by putting into practice any of the more than 88 ideas.

The central theme is you can achieve your goals by taking a genuine interest in understanding other people. Build on a foundation of knowing your customer. Understand the needs and motivation of people who work for you. Learn how to negotiate effectively to get the best deal from people who sell to you. This book is mildly reminiscent of Dale Carnegie’s 1936 classic [_How to Win Friends and Influence People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-the-digital-age/) but much more pertinent and accessible to the modern reader.
