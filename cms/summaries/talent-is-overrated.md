  ### Deliberate vs Mindless Practice


  > "It (talent) explains why great performers seem to do effortlessly certain
  things that most of us can’t imagine doing at all…why extraordinary performers
  are so rare; god-given talents are presumably not handed out willy-nilly… This
  explanation has the additional advantage of helping most of us come to
  somewhat melancholy terms with our own performance."- Talent is Overrated,
  page 3


  There should be no doubt that great performance requires hard work. But we all
  know individuals who work exceedingly hard and never succeed. The difference
  between hard work and getting nowhere versus hard work leading to great
  performance is the difference between mindlessly practicing (driving range,
  anyone?) and deliberately practicing skills that are just beyond your current
  capabilities in a manner that is well-designed and conducive to growth.


  Colvin delivers a step-by-step plan on how we can implement the principles of
  deliberate practice into our lives and become masters in our chosen fields.
  The catch—and there is a catch—it won’t be easy. But that may just be a good
  thing.

  ### Applying the Principles of Deliberate Practice


  > "Deliberate practice is above all an effort of focus and concentration."-
  Talent Is Overrated, page 70


  Colvin provides a road map for deliberate practice for those who are looking
  to up their performance in any field. It begins on knowing what field you are
  willing to devote your time and effort to. Then comes the practice. Colvin
  suggests three different models of practice to follow: music, chess, and
  sports.


  The music model is an analytical approach. If, for example, you were preparing
  a presentation, this model suggests focusing on the purpose of each part and
  practicing multiple times to develop the best method of presentation.


  The chess model of practice involves looking at past games of masters,
  comparing moves you would make to the moves they made. In business, we can use
  the chess model by reading case studies and articles, making note of potential
  solutions to real-world business problems.


  The sports model involves conditioning, going back to the basics of your field
  to sharpen your saw, and developing specific skills with simulation or
  practice.


  You must also find a way to practice in the work, through choosing which tasks
  to focus on, developing new methods to more effectively complete those tasks,
  and reviewing the progress you have made at the end of the day.

  ### Defining Deliberate Practice


  > "Identifying the learning zone and then forcing oneself to stay continually
  in it as it changes are the first and most important characteristics of
  deliberate practice."- Talent is Overrated, page 69


  When I think of practicing golf, I think of going to the driving range to hit
  a bucket of balls, heading to the putting green for 20 minutes of putting
  practice, and heading home. It is easy and mindless.


  When Tiger Woods thinks of practice, well, it’s entirely different. Tiger
  focuses in on specific skills that he needs to develop (hitting a buried
  bunker shot or cutting a ball underneath a series of trees yet flying it over
  a lake 50 yards out), even though he may only need to make that shot once a
  year. Because he has repeatedly practiced those shots, when the time comes,
  he’ll be able to make the shot when it counts.


  Deliberate practice is activity designed to improve performance. You should
  work with a teacher or coach to figure out what activities you need to
  improve. It can (and should) be repeated a lot. Feedback is continuously
  available. Deliberate practice is mentally taxing, to the point where
  practicing more than 4-5 hours per day is nearly impossible. And it isn’t very
  fun.


  Deliberate practice requires sacrifice and hard work, but if we choose to make
  the sacrifice, we can be among the top performers in our field, as most people
  prefer not to sacrifice and claim that bad luck, or bad genes, are the reason
  why they are stuck in life.

  When I played basketball, I had a coach that would say, “Practice doesn’t make
  perfect. Perfect practice makes perfect.” With Geoff Colvin’s _Talent Is
  Overrated_, I finally get the point.

Geoff Colvin, senior editor at _Forbes_ magazine, gives plenty of insight into the difference between top performers and average performers, and his answer isn’t exactly what you’d think it would be.

One typical thought when viewing the work of a master artist, or watching a professional athlete or musician perform, is that these people must have some inborn talent. We think back to our own experiences learning to draw, play sports, or pick a guitar and realize they have a divine gift, they were meant to do what they’re doing… they have more talent than us.

Colvin strikes this notion of talent down, reviewing countless examples of the hard work and years of practice that the top performers put themselves through, from Mozart to Tiger Woods. But it isn’t just hard work and logging the hours. Colvin reviews the research on a particular type of work, deliberate practice, and shows us how we can implement the principles of deliberate practice in our own lives.

### Deliberate vs Mindless Practice

There should be no doubt that great performance requires hard work. But we all know individuals who work exceedingly hard and never succeed. The difference between hard work and getting nowhere versus hard work leading to great performance is the difference between mindlessly practicing (driving range, anyone?) and deliberately practicing skills that are just beyond your current capabilities in a manner that is well-designed and conducive to growth.

Colvin delivers a step-by-step plan on how we can implement the principles of deliberate practice into our lives and become masters in our chosen fields. The catch—and there is a catch—it won’t be easy. But that may just be a good thing.
