  ### Be clear about your true intentions


  > "When you announce an objective at the beginning of your meeting, you’re
  being very clear about what you want to happen at the end of the meeting."-
  Talk Lean, page 51


  It’s surprising how many people plan a meeting or conversation without stating
  a clear outcome or goal of what they expect to happen at the end of the
  interaction. This happens because people are either afraid or uncomfortable to
  say what they’re actually thinking. If you’re thinking of something, say so.
  It adds value to the relationship and increases confidence in what you say.


  When you state your intentions at the beginning, you are being open and candid
  about what you want. Be direct and open about your intention. This sets the
  stage for increasing transparency and building trust with the other person (or
  people).


  A valid objective involves “what you want the other person (or people) to do
  or say or think at the end of the meeting, or what you want the two (or more)
  of you to have produced together at the end of the meeting.” It must be
  something that is achievable from all interested parties involved.


  So, you’ve declared what you’d like to achieve from your interaction. Now, how
  do you increase your odds of getting it?

  ### Relearn to listen


  > "Listening, despite appearing deceptively easy, is difficult to do
  effectively because our emotions distort our view of what was actually said
  and because we’re already busy analyzing and formulating responses whilst the
  other person is still speaking."- Talk Lean, page 97


  In today’s hyper-connected and information overloaded world, listening is a
  forgotten and underappreciated skill. We want 30 second sound bites and
  headline summaries of what’s happening. But how can you adequately address
  what someone’s concerns are if you don’t invest the time to listen?


  Palmer’s suggestion is to take notes by trying to capture the speaker’s exact
  words. He calls it rigorous listening and asserts that it helps to enhance
  understanding of what was actually said. Only once you understand what was
  said, can you adequately respond.


  The author also recommends paying attention to body language and gestures used
  by the person doing the talking. Is it consistent with the message? Palmer
  believes that “Your body will always unconsciously be providing indications
  about what you’re really thinking or feeling.” Words combined with gestures
  increase impact.

  ### Personalize your statements


  > "It’s always more powerful and better for the relationship to personalize
  the statement, to favor the first person over the second or the third."- Talk
  Lean, page 127


  When people have something difficult to say or are just uncomfortable being
  direct with someone, they hide behind meaningless impersonal phrases and
  indirectly try to communicate their point. They bury their true intentions to
  soften the blow and secretly hope the other person picks up on their subtle
  hints.


  A better and more effective method would be to personalize your message using
  “I”. Consider the author’s example, “I really want to work with you” versus
  “We’re hoping we can possibly reach a mutually beneficial agreement.” The
  first statement is much more powerful and direct. Or instead of saying “We’ll
  think about it”, perhaps saying “I’m not interested” would work better.


  The author also believes that you should “express yourself one idea at a time
  and then ask the other person what they think of what you’ve just said.” This
  gives the listener time to actually ponder what was said so you can address
  any concerns they may have. This increases your credibility and trust with the
  listener.
f_conclusion: >-
  I believe that if you consistently apply the skills in this great book, you
  can improve your communication results. The author offers great practical
  advice and it’s up to us to put it into practice. No go out there and ask
  yourself, “What do I need to do for that to happen?”

  and to ask for what you want and, if what you want is obtainable, it will give
  you the best chance of obtaining it quickly."

> "More modestly, \[this book\] will give you the courage to say what you think and to ask for what you want and, if what you want is obtainable, it will give you the best chance of obtaining it quickly." _\- Talk Lean, page 12_

_Talk Lean_ is based on a training approach created by Philippe de Lapoyade, who through his company Interactifs, has taught communication techniques for 25 years to companies all over the globe. The author, Alan Palmer, runs these seminars in Europe and was permissioned by Philippe to produce a written version of the methods presented at the seminars.

_Talk Lean: Shorter Meetings. Quicker Results. Better Relations,_ by Alan Palmer, provides a valuable framework for improving the results you want from your conversations and meetings. The principles and skills Palmer describes are a refreshing antidote to the struggles people experience when planning difficult conversations.

The author provides numerous examples, revealing clearer and more concise ways of getting your point across, including some that would be considered difficult or at least mildly uncomfortable such as asking your boss for a raise. Many of the methods or principles discussed focus on putting the listener in a proper frame of mind to listen and therefore be more receptive to your ideas. Its aim is to increase trust and transparency in all your communications. A good place to start is by figuring out and declaring the purpose of your conversation or meeting.
