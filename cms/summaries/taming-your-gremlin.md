  ### Perhaps there is a glorious rainbow behind the trees in my forest


  > "As long as you operate out of habit, you will limit your ability to fully
  experience, appreciate, and enjoy your gift of life."- Taming Your Gremlin,
  page 64


  According to our author, the word habit not only invokes a less than positive
  meaning, it is just downright mind numbing and boring. Repetition for the sake
  of consistency, ease and continuation of sameness results in a reduction of
  awareness — awareness of one’s surroundings and reactions to these
  surroundings. Habit blocks choice and the elimination of choice takes the fun
  out of life. Before you can look to make a change and evaluate if you even
  want to change, you need to understand where you are and what it feels like to
  be here…in this moment. Soak in the experience and emotion. There is no
  immediate need to act, but there is a need to own your current state and take
  accountability for the choices you may or may not make. Fear and exhilaration
  are different sides of the same coin. As individuals we decide whether or not
  to take the adventurous route on this day or that day with no judgement about
  should or ought to.

  ### Learning to love the dark


  > "Being in process is an attitude – an appreciation of this simple truth and
  of the reality that your life will be forever unfolding and your future always
  unknown. "- Taming Your Gremlin, page 164


  Sorry to spoil the book, but there is no end game. Your gremlin (inner critic)
  will never be silent all the time. At best, we can learn to coexist. Life is
  both positive and negative. What we can do is make an active choice to live in
  all these moments. Choose to be aware of your gremlin and aware of the impact
  his presence has on you. Don’t be surprised when he shows up unannounced and
  unwelcome. Your gremlin is part of you; so, you should expect that he will be
  along for the ride that you call your life. BUT this does not need to be a
  negative. It is in an adventure. Your lifelong relationship with your gremlin
  is an ongoing, moment to moment process. There will be fabulous days, but they
  won’t last forever. There will be really rotten days, but they won’t last
  forever either. In every moment, you can find adventure and chose to be really
  aware and change if you want to.


  What I enjoyed most about the book was Carson’s approach. He did not present
  his ideas as doctrine or gospel. In fact, he encourages the reader to set the
  book aside if something does not make sense and revisit the idea on another
  day. In very simple terms, taming our inner critic is about absorbing what is
  going on around us and our reactions to this, being flexible to change and
  actively making choices.


  One action the author discourages the reader from doing is actively engaging
  with his or her gremlin. As a relatively strong type A person, I would say (if
  I were to be completely honest) there are days when I feel very strong and
  would even consider competing with my gremlin. I want to prove him wrong, and
  doing so might bring me a sense of accomplishment. He might try and trick me
  and change his tactics, but one my good days, I think I am pretty darn clever
  too! Sometimes, I don’t really want a Zen change moment, I want to pummel my
  gremlin and shove him out of my way. How about you?

  > "I free myself not by trying to be free but by simply noticing how I am
  imprisoning myself in the very moment I am imprisoning myself."- Taming Your
  Gremlin, page 92


  Mmmmm….it took me a few minutes of thinking this through before I could really
  appreciate the sentiment. First off, there is no part of “simply noticing”
  that strikes me as simple. There is so much dialogue in our heads that blocks
  us from noticing what is immediately in front of us and filters out what is
  important for us to see or take in. The idea that I can’t force myself to
  simply notice or will it to happen frustrates the high achiever in me a
  little. However, I only need to remember one instance of racing around the
  supermarket like Wonder Woman, checking off tasks on my smart phone to be
  bowled over by the pure sense of warmth and awe when my 5 year old grabbed my
  hand and pointed in the direction of the lady bug he was fascinated by. There
  was pure, utter delight on his face. I didn’t need to intellectualize his joy,
  nor did I rationalize the importance of all the tasks on my list. In that
  instant, I recognized that I almost missed a moment that truly made me happy.
  Important to note, my Gremlin came out in full force immediately afterwards
  telling me that Wonder Woman would have planned for that experience.


  To have a viable relationship with your Gremlin, try adopting the role of
  witness. Throw interpretation and evaluation out the window and simply notice.
  Let the actions wash over you and notice the effect it has on you. Simply
  notice. No judgement. From there, you can decide to do something different…if
  you choose.

> "Like it or not you are, indeed, in charge. And if that realization has not left you shaking in your boots, then you have not fully had it." _\- Taming Your Gremlin, page 129_

I have a confession to make. Before I picked up _Taming Your Gremlin_, I had never read a self-help book before. I was a total newbie to this genre, and had no idea what to expect. What struck me most about the book was its style. Carson writes in such a way that it feels like you are listening to him speak as opposed to reading his words on the page. I really enjoyed that the book was practical and concise, contained the right amount of humor to keep my interest and included compelling stories that made me smile or laugh out loud.

Now, let’s talk about Carson’s Gremlin, a metaphor for that inner critic that resides in our head, chatters in our ear, eats away our confidence and generally causes strife and distress in our lives. Carson argues that you will never fully remove the Gremlin from inside your head because it will never go away, but you can use some simple strategies to make its voice less powerful and less of an obstacle to achieving inner peace. Inner peace is not a concept I grasp quite as easily as others, but fulfillment, contentment and a general feeling of balance are equal and effective substitutes for me. This is meaty subject matter, but the content does not come off as heavy or weighty. It just makes good plain sense.
