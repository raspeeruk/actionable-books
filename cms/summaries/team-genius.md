  ### Team Diagnosis is Essential—Ask 20 Questions


  > "Every one of those teams is currently at some point in its life cycle. Some
  of these teams are clearly dysfunctional; others are suboptimal in their
  performance; and still others are approaching the end of their usefulness.
  Even great teams are always being challenged to do all that they are capable
  of doing."- Team Genius, page xvii


  The authors recommend twenty questions you should ask about teams you manage
  and are a member of:


  Questions you should always ask:


  1.  Is your organization, and the teams that compose it, up to the challenges
  they face in a hyper competitive global economy?

  2.  If not, is there some way to accelerate your understanding of teams?

  3.  Can you apply that new knowledge in a way that lets you build teams both
  fast and appropriately for the ever changing challenges that face you?

  4.  Can you find the right team at the right moment?

  5.  Can you identify the right moment when one team needs to be dissolved to
  create another, perhaps in a very different form?


  Questions about your own skills in creating and managing teams:


  1.  If the fate of your organization depended on it, could you identify those
  great teams?

  2.  Do you know how to staff a team for a specific task?

  3.  If you were assigned the task of reorganizing the subpar teams to ensure
  their top performance, would you know how to do it?

  4.  Would you even know where to start?

  5.  By the same token, if you were to look at the top-performing teams in your
  company- in management, manufacturing, R&D, sales- would you be able to
  identify which ones were reaching the end of their life span?

  6.  Would you have the courage to shut them down?

  7.  Would you know how to handle that retirement without creating acrimony and
  killing morale among some of your most talented employees?

  8.  Would you know how to recompose a replacement team to be just as effective
  and without losing any time?


  Questions about your organization’s capabilities:


  1.  Can your company’s teams stay ahead of the changes affecting your industry
  and customers?

  2.  Are your teams able to anticipate and respond to sudden disruptions in
  technology, economics and customer behavior?

  3.  Are your teams leveraging globalism and multicultural values as strengths?

  4.  Is mobile technology helping or hurting your team’s performance? How are
  you performing in this area relative to your competition?

  5.  Are your team’s missions and values being supported or undercut by social
  media?

  6.  Do you have the right people in the right positions in the right teams?

  7.  Are your teams the right size for the job?


  Asking these questions will help you define where your team is in it’s life
  cycle, and ultimately work more effectively.

  ### Teams are Human Nature


  > "At no point in the development of civilization, and across six millennia,
  have small, fundamental teams ever been abandoned as unnecessary or obsolete.
  Rather, they remain essential building blocks in the structure of ever larger
  institutions."- Team Genius, page 18


  The human drive to form teams is a survival mechanism for individuals:
  evidence shows that solitary individuals have shorter life spans than their
  more social counterparts. Teamwork goes back to the dawn of time, recent
  studies have confirmed that working together beyond kin with snap decisions
  results in more cooperation. The longer we think about a decision the more
  selfish we are inclined to be. Working in a team climate impacts our mammalian
  brain and levels of oxytocin where social norms can shape behavior with
  reduced requirement for rules and regulations to enforce it and can also make
  us less stressed and ultimately happier. By embracing teams as an expression
  of our natural state, we can get more done, and create better solutions than
  we could working on our own.

  ### Teams are Dynamic


  > "Humans constantly form teams - usually first as pairs that coalesce into
  larger groupings—but, in emergencies, we have been known to form coordinating,
  effective, and trusting pairs in seconds… the astonishing range of types of
  teams, beginning with pairs, shows the universality and flexibility of this
  phenomenon in daily life."- Team Genius, page 113


  The authors provide great advice for evaluating the success of teams and how
  to manage those that appear either healthy or unhealthy. Though I am aware of
  other descriptions of the team life cycle, I must admit I loved the way
  Karlgaard and Malone describe them, as it made more sense to me in today’s
  environment. They are briefly summarized below:


  **Formation:** Individuals band together, establish relationships whilst
  defining goals and delegating the right tasks to the right members.


  **Establishment:** Rules, metrics, milestones and communication methods are
  identified as work starts on the task. Norms and team culture are established.


  **Operational:** Focus shifts from structure to working on task content.


  **Functional** This involves resetting milestones and deadlines, coping with
  member personalities, idiosyncrasies and strengths and weaknesses; external
  forces may put further stress and confusion on the team whose still immature
  interpersonal relationships may not yet be strong enough to handle them.


  **Cultural:** Events become the legends and experiences that define team
  culture.


  **Sustainable:** Departure and arrival ceremonies occur to maintain the team’s
  sustainability.


  **Maturation and Consolidation:** Maturity brings together and consolidates
  disparate operations toward a final goal. Consolidation is accomplished with a
  robust infrastructure, clearly established lines of communication and rules of
  behaviour.


  **Completion:** Work starts on packaging the results for senior management
  and/or investors.


  **End:** Successful teams are shut down or transformed into a new team with a
  new task.


  **Aftermath:** The period following the retirement of a team.
f_conclusion: >-
  A new science of teams is critical if we are to be ready for the continuing
  changes and advances we are likely to witness. Teams must be capable of
  surviving on their own and be designed to work with, not against, team
  members’ individual approaches to work. Teams must be given the requisite
  support to reach their full potential. Team size and composition is critical
  for achieving strategic goals. The authors discuss the importance of cognitive
  diversity in creating successful teams and other aspects of creating team
  genius. The reader is under no illusion that managing teams is easy or
  straightforward, nor is it always successful. Great advice and guidance is
  provided on how to handle this. I encourage individuals currently leading or
  planning to lead teams read this book for their own takeaways and learnings.

> "Teams compose a large part of our private and public lives. We depend on them for both our success and our happiness." _\- Team Genius, page xiv_

In _Team Genius_, authors Rich Karlgaard and Michael S. Malone focus on giving their readers a clear understanding that work gets done by informal teams and have set out to pull together an extremely comprehensive approach to explaining and evidencing why this is the case. They provide a wealth of real-life examples to support their arguments ranging from George Washington to Gilbert and Sullivan. Based on research and their own extensive experience, the authors also provide their readers with the insights into how to create their own Team Genius.

I was astonished at how much research, evidence and guidance the authors have managed to pack into their book. They highlight the challenges to teams in today’s world, namely the pace of change, including technological change, demographic shifts, the experience of the upcoming generation of future leaders, and globalization more generally.
