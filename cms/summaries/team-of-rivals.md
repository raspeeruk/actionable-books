  ### Self-awareness


  > "Lincoln's ability to retain his emotional balance in such difficult
  situations was rooted in acute self-awareness and an enormous capacity to
  dispel anxiety in constructive ways."- Team of Rivals, page 609


  Self-awareness was the cornerstone of Lincoln’s ability to remain in control
  of himself, and coordinate his prodigious talents and knowledge to effectively
  lead his government. With his “uncanny understanding of his shifting moods”
  and “profound self-awareness”, he was often able to identify possible sources
  of his sadness and anxiety very quickly, and develop approaches to help
  minimize their impact on his day-to-day life while taking a pulse of his
  readiness to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of waging war. When seven
  southern states declared secession from the Union before he could take office,
  Lincoln initially made the mistake of underestimating the gravity of the
  situation. When the North-South animosity reached fever pitch, he was able to
  hold himself in check long enough to not take the advice of his colleagues and
  peers and exacerbate the situation by sending in troops to reinforce southern
  forts and thereby provoke war with the secessionists. Although it is likely
  that he felt that war was inevitable after a point, he recognized that he had
  the moral advantage, and so instead made overtures about “resupplying” forts
  such as Fort Sumter in South Carolina with food and ammunition, to which the
  south predictably responded by attacking and capturing the fort. Thus, Lincoln
  was provided with the moral justification to claim that the United States of
  America was dragged into a war not of its own choosing.


  By letting his enemies paint themselves into a diplomatic corner, Lincoln was
  able to align his goals of retaining national unity at any cost with his
  uncanny understanding of the public’s sentiments, and thereby increase his own
  political influence and authority in continuing an unpopular war.


  By practicing techniques that improve your self-awareness – such meditation or
  reading fiction – you can give yourself an emotional anchor to hold onto that
  allows you to stay on course even in the midst of the incredibly stressful
  pressures.

  ### Always remember how to be entertaining


  > "Time and time again, he was the one who dispelled his colleagues' anxiety
  and settled their spirits with his gift for storytelling and his
  life-affirming sense of humour. When resentment and contention threatened to
  destroy his administration, he refused to be provoked by petty grievances, to
  submit to jealousy, or to brood over perceived slights. Through the appalling
  pressures he faced day after day, he retained an unflagging faith in his
  country's cause."- Team of Rivals, page 16


  As with
  [Roosevelt](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-rise-of-theodore-roosevelt/),
  Lincoln managed to wield the strength of his personality as a political
  weapon. As “a master of timing”, he knew that a well-timed joke or one-liner,
  candid admission of truth or difficulty, and earnestness in a public forum
  would help him win over the loyalty of his rivals. Indeed, his entire cabinet
  was drawn of precisely such men who were initially contemptuous of the
  newly-elected president, but were eventually won over by the strength of his
  personality and magnanimity. The wily and astute William Henry Seward, the
  “celebrated senator from New York” who had also served two terms as governor
  of the same state, joined the Lincoln administration with great reluctance as
  Secretary of State, but eventually “settled into an assessment of Lincoln that
  “His confidence and compassion increase every day” and became Lincoln’s
  “closest friend and advisory in the administration.” The “distinguished elder
  statesman” from Missouri, Edward Bates, was initially dismissive of him upon
  joining the administration as Attorney-General, but “eventually concluded that
  the president was an unmatched leader, “very near being a perfect man.”
  Republican Senator Salmon P. Chase, himself a heavyweight in the political
  caucus, had played a central role in the formation of the national Republican
  party in 1854 and nursed a machine-like ambition for the presidency, but, at
  the very end “acknowledged that Lincoln had outmaneuvered him.”


  A sense of humour is never unwelcome, and all the more effective at cutting
  through tempers and egos when wielded in conjunction with a charming
  personality. Take the time to build a store of jokes, present a laid-back
  demeanor and make sure to always have interesting facts and figures at your
  fingertips to dispel boredom and moments of immense humdrum. It can mean
  keeping the best talent you have on your side.

  ### When there are no rules, improvise


  > "More accustomed to relying upon himself to shape events, he took the
  greatest control... displaying a fierce ambition, an exceptional political
  acumen, and a wide range of emotional strengths, forged in the crucible of
  personal hardship, that took his unsuspecting rivals by surprise."- Team of
  Rivals, page 16


  In 1861, Lincoln suspended the writ of habeus corpus (a legal distinction that
  prevents arrest without a trial) which allowed the US army and police services
  to arrest and detain thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers in
  several cities. His readiness to unilaterally increase his own war powers,
  suspend civil liberties, personally take charge of the war effort away from
  his subordinates and ruthlessly coax, cajole and coerce allies and rivals
  alike into supporting his policies helped ensure that the war effort was
  supported at all costs. At the outbreak of war and soon after, he took the
  initiative to map out a war strategy, use the Navy to blockade all Confederate
  ports, use gunboats to take control of the Southern waterways, send men to
  their certain deaths in repeated campaigns to capture key towns and forts,
  press immigrants into the war service, personally hire and fire military
  generals, read extensively to educate himself on the science of warfare, and
  shamelessly put to use political funds that were available to bribe and
  purchase support for the war.


  His readiness to court illegality by improvising with his executive powers and
  pushing through new and unconventional legislation that ordinarily would have
  spelled political suicide was reinforced by his moral sure-footedness and
  uncanny ability to gauge and align with the public’s mood, helping him
  pre-empt his enemies and keep them on the defensive. Sometimes, as evinced in
  his case, the end could justify the means.


  Sometimes you simply have to stop delegating and take charge of a situation
  yourself. In such taut, fine-trigger situations of sensitive importance,
  micromanagement and improvisation can even be welcome.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s important to realize that all the members of his cabinet outmatched
  Lincoln with the length of their political lives and the diversity of their
  public service, but Lincoln outmatched them with the degree of his political
  ambitions, and “because he was shrewdest and canniest of them all” in
  manipulating personalities to suit his ambitions. As Goodwin puts it, “every
  member of this administration was better known, better educated, and more
  well-known in public life than… the obscure prairie lawyer from Springfield.”
  But it was the “profound self-confidence” and “a most unexpected greatness”
  combined with a shrewd understanding of politics and personalities, egos and
  pride combined with cunning adaptability – the recognition that the
  extraordinary circumstances of his presidency allowed him to take risks beyond
  the limits imposed on all presidents prior to him – and the willingness to act
  without hesitation on all of these realizations that made Lincoln “the
  undisputed captain of this most unusual cabinet, truly a team of rivals.

  "There is little necessity on this occasion to speak at length and critically
  of this great and good man, and of his high mission in the world. That ground
  has been fully occupied... The whole field of fact and fancy has been gleaned
  and garnered. Any man can say things that are true of Abraham Lincoln, but no
  man can say anything that is new of Abraham Lincoln."

> "There is little necessity on this occasion to speak at length and critically of this great and good man, and of his high mission in the world. That ground has been fully occupied... The whole field of fact and fancy has been gleaned and garnered. Any man can say things that are true of Abraham Lincoln, but no man can say anything that is new of Abraham Lincoln." _\- Frederick Douglass on Abraham Lincoln, Team of Rivals, page 15_

**Fortunately, we can.** The challenge with retelling the story of Abraham Lincoln, as Douglass pointed out, is that we’re pretty sure we know all the facts of his life. Lincoln is arguably one of the most well-known and exhaustively studied American politicians, a personality on whom more than 16,000 books have been published, and whose assassination alone has been covered in over 125 books.

But here’s where Doris Kearns Goodwin differs from other scholars. Rather than focusing exclusively on the writings of Lincoln and his correspondence to present us with the time-beiged saintly image of a martyr-president who was forced to get his hands dirty in a civil war not of his own choice, Goodwin instead presents us with a different image of a high-minded and progressive but shrewd, cunning, politically astute and occasionally amoral Lincoln who knew exactly how to work his way around friends and enemies in order to get what he wanted from them. **A saint, perhaps, but one who was not averse to making hair-raising decisions with chilling calm and ease**, whose feet were firmly planted in the material realm and whose head was not lost in the clouds, but stooped over to scrutinize more earthly concerns.
