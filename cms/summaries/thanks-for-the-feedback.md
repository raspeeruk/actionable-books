  ### The Three Primary Feedback Triggers


  > "Understanding our triggers and sorting out what sets them off are the keys
  to managing our reactions and engaging in feedback conversations with skill."-
  Thanks for the Feedback, page 16


  The good news about feedback triggers is that while we may feel as if they are
  innumerable, they can be isolated into three major types—**truth**,
  **relationship** and **identity**. When we get feedback that causes a reaction
  in us, invariably it is setting off one (or more) of these three triggers.


  We experience Truth Triggers when we feel that the feedback we’ve received is
  off-base, unhelpful, or just plain wrong. Relationship Triggers are set off
  not so much because of what is said—but because of who said it. “**Who** are
  **they** to tell us that—they always do the same thing—only worse?” or
  “Really, after I’ll I’ve done for you, you could say that?” Finally, Identity
  Triggers are about who we are—and are tripped by feedback that undermines
  something that we hold to be true about ourselves, at our very core. This kind
  of feedback can cause us to lose balance, feel threatened and experience
  profound self-doubt. When an identity trigger is activated, we react by
  entering into survival mode rather than by working with what might actually be
  useful in the feedback we heard.


  By understanding, naming and acknowledging these triggers we remove the
  primary obstacle that gets in the way of skillfully receiving feedback. We can
  powerfully decide what we want to accept and what we choose not to accept. As
  long as we are operating from within the triggers, on the other hand, we can’t
  hear what we would benefit from hearing—and we may overreact to what is not
  valuable.

  ### From “Wrongspotting” to “Difference Spotting”


  > "We listen to feedback with this question in mind: ‘What’s wrong with this
  feedback?’ And as it turns out, we can almost always find something."- Thanks
  for the Feedback, page 46


  Heen and Stone coin the term “wrongspotting” to describe what we typically do
  with feedback. There are a myriad of ways to poke holes in the feedback we
  receive—to view it as wrong. And, the reality is that in some ways it IS
  wrong. The problem is that by deeming it “wrong,” we fail to see what might be
  “right” and we fail to try to understand what’s behind the feedback. We
  dismiss the entire thing because of who it’s given by, because of the timing,
  or because some part of it is, in fact, not true.


  Understanding means going below the surface of the words. It means clarifying
  the potential difference between what you heard and what was meant. It also
  means going further—trying to understand why each of you sees it differently.
  We need to move from an “it’s wrong” response to a “tell me more” response.

  ### Shape the feedback you get by asking for the feedback you need


  > "When we use the word ‘feedback,’ we may be referring to any of three
  different kinds of information: appreciation, coaching and evaluation. Each
  serves an important purpose, each satisfies different needs, and each comes
  with its own set of challenges."- Thanks for the Feedback, page 31


  Feedback comes in three flavors.


  There is appreciation—which is simply expressing gratitude—it’s about
  connection, and involves recognition of who we are and what we do.
  Appreciation means that we’ve been seen and understood by others.


  Feedback can also come in the form of coaching—someone else’s attempt to help
  us to improve—which takes the form of advice, direction, suggestions or
  guidance. While we are open to this type of feedback when it’s helping us
  learn a new skill or develop new capacity, it’s more of a challenge when it’s
  given without us requesting it—in response to what the other person perceives
  as a problem in our relationship with them, based on what the feedback giver
  is feeling.


  The third type of feedback is evaluation—a score, a performance review, an
  assessment of some sort. Evaluations are important—they “align expectations,
  clarify consequences, and inform decision making.” Evaluation also can make us
  feel judged, nervous, or anxious.


  The problem is that the feedback we get is not always the feedback we are
  seeking—or needing. If we need to be appreciated and receive coaching, we may
  not hear the coaching. If we are unsure of where we stand, we might need
  evaluative feedback before we can hear the coaching we are offered. If what we
  really need is coaching, evaluation might be premature. And, if we really want
  coaching, appreciation probably won’t suffice.


  What can we do? Ask for what we need. So, for example, rather than just asking
  for “some feedback,” get specific. Ask someone to tell you where you stand on
  the project, or tell them you’d like some coaching, or let them know you just
  need some words of appreciation or encouragement. Remember that evaluation can
  be read into all feedback and can make it hard to hear any other dimension of
  feedback—so be aware of the tendency to hear more evaluation than was
  intended.
f_conclusion: >-
  We are all both givers and receivers of feedback. We give feedback consciously
  and unconsciously, just as we are constantly receiving and processing
  feedback. This book will help you become a more conscious receiver of
  feedback. It will also encourage you to become a seeker of feedback. And,
  despite the title and focus, I’m confident that this book will help you to
  learn to give feedback so that it can be better received.

  "It doesn’t matter how much authority or power a feedback giver has; the
  receivers are in control of what they do and don’t let in, how they make sense
  of what they’re hearing, and whether they choose to change."

> "It doesn’t matter how much authority or power a feedback giver has; the receivers are in control of what they do and don’t let in, how they make sense of what they’re hearing, and whether they choose to change." _\- Thanks for the Feedback, page 5_

Sheila Heen, Douglas Stone and Bruce Patton’s _Difficult Conversations_ remains one of the most important books on my book shelf—one that I go back to time and time again—and one that I recommend widely. Now, Heen and Stone’s new book, _Thanks for the Feedback_, published a full fifteen years after their first, is going to join and perhaps supersede the place of their first book on my shelf.

Both practical and profound, the authors argue that as humans we want to both learn and improve AND be loved and accepted for who we now are. Feedback, regardless of how it’s given, can threaten the notion that we are okay the way we are—and thus receiving it can be challenging and can trigger us in a variety of ways. Yet, in order to grow, we need feedback.

While most of what you read and learn about feedback focuses on feedback giver, this book puts the burden of feedback on the receiver. The authors contend that by becoming skillful receivers and requesters of feedback, we can fully own our learning and growth. Feedback is no longer something that is “pushed” at us, but something that we “pull” towards us. And, as we become skillful at the art of receiving feedback, we develop the capacity to learn from anyone and anything. We can transform feedback, even when it is poorly delivered, and leverage it for our growth and development.
