  ### A collective response is the only way


  > "Our problem is us – we’ve stopped trying to form a more perfect union."-
  That Used to Be Us, Preface


  The idea is not to become something else to fix this (be like China or
  whomever is doing well), but to go back to our roots. “To be like us”.


  This will take a public awakening, establishment of political will, resetting
  priorities, sacrificing for the future, an alliance of government, business
  and citizens. It will take truth telling, sensible investment, rebirth of
  civility, cessation of political and business leaders’ pandering. It will take
  engineering, science, technology and education.


  The authors portray a profound sense of optimism that the people of the United
  States _can_ work together because of our history of rising to great
  challenges. They point out that we won our independence through a daring,
  violent break with the richest country in world, settled a vast and wild
  continent, waged a bloody civil war from which we recovered so rapidly that we
  built the largest economy on the planet in a few decades, had armed forces
  that tipped the balance in Europe in WW1 and our tanks, aircraft and ships
  were central to the defeat of Germany and Japan in WW2. The challenges of the
  past were so much more in-your-face than globalization, energy consumption,
  technology, growing budget deficits. It’s hard to look up from our smart
  phones to do something about these.

  ### We are frustrated optimists


  > "….what keeps us optimistic about America is the seemingly endless number of
  people who come here or live here who just didn’t get the word."- That Use to
  Be Us, chapter 14


  Wave after wave of people still come to the US eager to try something new. So
  while the media and politicians may be bad-mouthing the United States, people
  are still seeing the underlying American character, still seeing and wanting
  the American Dream.


  I loved the whole chapter with examples of people “who just didn’t get the
  word” – college drop outs who started the four biggest companies in the world,
  soldiers who were “just too dumb to quit” when they should have surrendered
  and so who won instead, teachers, inventors, civil servants, etc.


  This caused me to think about a person reading this book 100 years from now.
  I’ve read many writings from 100 and 200 years ago and have been amazed that
  the writers complain of immorality, loss of the values the United States was
  founded on (some within 25 years of the signing of the Constitution), etc. We
  think it’s just now. So, will people in 100 years read this book and be amazed
  that an era they thought of as more stable than theirs wasn’t?

  ### A lethal combination of cockiness and complacency


  > "The American people are starved for 3 things – truth, leadership and
  solutions."- That Used to Be Us, Preface


  The United States had been king of the world and we keep retelling our
  wonderful story because the present is so overwhelming we have to live in the
  past. Again with the complacency you say. I know but that’s what’s stopping
  us. The authors have an answer – a five part formula for success:


  1.  Access to post-secondary education for more.

  2.  Upgrade the infrastructure.

  3.  Admit more talented immigrants.

  4.  Create regulations to encourage risk taking without recklessness.

  5.  Spend more on research and development to expand behaviors of physics,
  biology, chemistry, energy, material sciences.


  Our ability to work together to make these changes is just as important to
  other countries as to the United States. If we’re not strong economically,
  robust socially, cohesive politically we can’t be the stabilizing force for
  things taking shape in the world.


  Yet three years after this book was researched and written, none of the five
  appear to me to have been implemented.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book was written to help us _not_ resign ourselves to a future that looks
  like the present, or worse, for the United States. The authors obviously
  intend it to be a call to action, as reading it made me feel great instead of
  depressed at the magnitude of what has to change. We as Americans, and in fact
  all developed nations, are called to adapt to a new environment. They remind
  us that adaptation has been found to be particularly urgent when a species’
  environment changes and ours has. If we don’t adapt soon we run the risk of
  becoming dinosaurs (and you know what happened to them).

> "We have risen to challenges more formidable than these." _\- That Used to Be Us, Preface_

Economically the United States has a high deficit and high debt.

Politically we are paralyzed by hyper-partisanism.

And what’s worse, “People have sort of gotten used to it”, according to Thomas L. Friedman and Michael Madelbaum, authors of _That Used to Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World_. There is a sense that America’s best days are behind us. There is a sense, haven’t you felt it, of resignation?

We’ve become a nation of wusses. Think of the discussion in late January 2014 about postponing the Super Bowl for two days due to the potential of icy roads. Really? Are you kidding me? We’re talking about the Super Bowl! Americans used to embrace challenges, strike out into the wilderness, and do it at all costs. Recently, as we approached mountain ranges again and again while driving in the vast, beyond belief, open spaces of New Mexico, Arizona, and Eastern California I thought, how did the settlers keep going? How did they keep up their “stick-to-it” attitude? What happened to that?

The authors say that the beginning of the United States’ unhealthiness was Nov 11, 1989 – the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. Why was this the beginning? We assumed we no longer had a need for urgent and sustained collective action. We didn’t fully grasp what was happening so we didn’t do anything about it – we relaxed, we underinvested and we lived in the moment (losing one’s competitor can be problematic). The same economic barrier removal is happening in Brazil, China and India where they have a super strong work ethic plus innovative technology. Now we have to run faster just to keep up. There is a lack of understanding that we live in a new world.

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book
