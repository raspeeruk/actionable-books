  ### How to change your life in small ways for a big impact


  > "The vast majority of people spend more time planning their wedding day or
  buying a second-hand car than they do planning their life and their career."-
  The 1% Principle, page 1


  This how Tom O’Neil starts his book, bemoaning the fact that few of us really
  plan and focus on what we want out of life, and setting goals and writing them
  down is what he believes is the answer.


  But not big, hairy audacious goals. No, more the day-to-day ways we can change
  our lives for the better. His philosophy is simple, and involves asking
  yourself “what one thing can I do today to improve my life and the life of
  someone near to me by 1%?”


  His argument is that by taking small incremental steps we can reach our goals
  and change our lives for the better. This way we are consistently moving
  forward. He calls them mini goals which can impact different aspects of your
  life.


  It could be, for example, to go for two ten-minute walks twice a week or
  phoning up about a class you are interested in. In other words, stuff that is
  probably on your to-do list.

  ### Moment making


  > "Create moments – that make memories – that build lives"- The 1% Principle,
  page 105


  To help the reader adapt and adopt the 1% philosophy, in part three O’Neil
  outlines his 30 Day Program which he’s developed to help you turn the 1%
  principle into a habit.


  Each day has a set topic and exercise for you to complete – from what’s your
  passion; taking risks; to becoming resilient and happy with change. I
  particularly liked his section on taking time out.


  He and his wife have two young children and so they work hard to create
  moments, highlights in their children’s lives. As he points out these moments
  don’t have to cost a lot of money and can be as simple as a picnic or camping
  overnight on the back yard.


  In another life, I used to teach a parenting course, and often I would ask
  what the mothers’ most memorable time was growing up. Without fail it was time
  spent one-on-one with a parent. Creating positive moments is something a child
  always remembers and I am glad he advocates for it in his book.

  ### Small changes that propel you forward


  > "If you’re not happy with the way things are in your life, you are the only
  one who can take responsibility and start making changes."- The 1% Principle,
  page 54


  O’Neil believes that you can change your life by 1% on a daily basis in the
  following areas: Finance, Health, Personal Development, Career,
  Marriage/Partner, Children, Family, Extended Family, Friends, Other People,
  Faith/Spirituality, Lifestyle, Joy/Happiness, Community, Challenges, and Time
  Management.


  And that’s just under personal goals. He produces a similarly comprehensive
  list under business goals. So there’s no escaping how you could easily change
  your life by taking one of these small steps.


  The suggestions are good in that they are small, achievable, and quite likely
  something you’ve been meaning to do.


  But quite likely, they are actions you’ve been sloughing off – like ensuring
  all your insurance policies are up to date, or setting up direct debits for
  common household bills. Simple steps that would make your life easier.


  Other suggestions include touching base with a friend you’ve not spoken to in
  a while.


  This was something we actually did the other week. We’d been talking for ages
  about phoning some friends in Vancouver, and last weekend we just did it. Why
  it took us so long I don’t know, but what I do know was it felt good, which
  makes me think O’Neil may be on to something.


  As you read through the lists of things you could do and add to your to-do
  list, he does caution not to get carried away, otherwise it becomes
  overwhelming and subsequently defeats the purpose of the exercise.


  “Don’t try to completely change your life straight away – you have the rest of
  your life to do that. It is easy to get over-motivated and take on too much,
  setting yourself up to fail.”
f_conclusion: >-
  I like the premise behind this small 159-page book because there are times
  when we can feel stuck, and O’Neil shows you that you can make changes and
  make your way towards your end goal.

Like many busy people, I am always looking at ways that I can move forward in a time efficient way, so I was keen to summarize Tom O’Neil’s _The 1% Principle: How Small Steps Can Dramatically Improve Your Life and Potential_ to see if it would give me the tools and impetus to adopt some of the strategies he recommends.

As a daily list maker, some of his ideas dovetailed well with what I already do as I’ve always taken what I call a “Swiss Cheese” approach to bigger projects, breaking the tasks down so I am always moving forward, but I gained some new insights through this book.

I like the premise behind this small 159-page book because there are times when we can feel stuck, and O’Neil shows you that you can make changes and make your way towards your end goal.

I found the section where he gives ideas of the 1% changes we could make extremely helpful as they were doable and not overwhelming. In fact, it is worth getting the book just for those suggestions.

He has an early section on the 8 laws of the 1% principle which seemed a bit repetitive and did not do much to further your understanding. Neither did some of the examples he gave early on as they were mostly sports-related, and as a non-sports aficionado they went right over my head.

But having said that, this book is useful to jump start the changes you want to make in your life, or to use with clients who are drowning in their sea of overwhelm. It gives you concrete steps to take that can inch you to shore.

As an ex-Brit I was able to follow some of his lingo – but for the uninformed – the boot is the trunk of the car; and garbage is called rubbish both in the UK and New Zealand where he is based.

He quotes Howard Thurman “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.” And this book gives you the prods you may need to come alive and be who you are meant to be. Just one step at a time.
