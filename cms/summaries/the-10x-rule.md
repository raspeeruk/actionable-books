  ### Parkinson’s Law & The New Rich


  > "The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create
  luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and
  mobility."- The 4-Hour Workweek, page 7


  The story starts with burn out. Many experience it in pursuit of the ultimate
  goal: pulling longer hours in pursuit of movement, crafting meeting after
  meeting chasing visibility, sacrificing self-care in favor of self-promotion.
  Ferriss adamantly argues that it is all a myth, the 9-5 rat race is designed
  in such a way as to keep the wheel turning and the status quo protected. This
  is known as Parkinson’s Law, where “a task will swell in perceived importance
  and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.” The
  arbitrary nature of 8 hours a day should have us questioning how each job and
  each unique industry conveniently fits into 40 hours per week, but when
  challenge strikes or a roadblock is presented the same worker can pump out
  their work in two hours in favor of attending to their sick children, or
  avoiding poor weather conditions. Ferriss suggests that when ultimate
  efficiency and effectiveness are re-introduced to the highest degree, meetings
  and phone calls become arbitrary, face time can be limited and 8 hours can be
  revered as overkill. When the work is at utmost efficiency, and living life at
  the forefront becomes the ultimate goal, you are considered part of The New
  Rich (NR).


  As a reader, we are encouraged to question the model we find ourselves
  entrenched in and demand more. In order to live the life we want, rather than
  what is prescribed, we need to set limitations, work towards independence and
  utilize the ultimate currency of time and mobility.

  ### Free Yourself Up


  > "Set the rules in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to
  define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial
  tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. Do not let people
  interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle."- The 4-Hour
  Workweek, page 111


  In order to live the lifestyle you have crafted, the next step is to free
  yourself of the limiting constraints of the 9-5 job. While Ferriss is quite
  adamant that the ideal would be self-employment with a very targeted product
  and buyer ship that can be guided and tweaked from anywhere, he has shared
  various ways of cutting through the mold and establishing more of what you
  want and it can all be simplified by using the 80/20 Principle.


  “80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.” How often do we
  flip this on its head and lose sight of productivity and efficiency, investing
  80% of our time and reaping only maybe 20% of the progress? This can manifest
  in useless meetings, lengthy email exchanges, needless conference calls or
  needy, low paying customers—there are countless examples of time and effort
  wasted in favor of filling the space and maintaining the status quo. By
  focusing on the 80/20 principle we are committing to ultimate efficiency in
  time and freeing ourselves up to live the life we ultimately crave.


  Ferriss shares a couple of examples to uphold the 20% effort:


  *   Limiting meetings and policing face time to reflect quick, decisive
  agendas.

  *   Set an automatic response to indicate your priorities and manage
  expectations for your co-workers and customers.

  *   Abandoning needy, low-paying customers and focusing on maintaining the
  heavier minority.

  *   Do not multitask, rather prioritize and establish two primary goals for
  the day to achieve ultimate satisfaction.

  ### Design the Life You Want


  > "Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely
  what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all…’What would excite me?’"-
  The 4-Hour Workweek, page 51-52


  So often we limit our own happiness or excitement by sticking to convention.
  Ferriss argues the synonym to happiness is excitement and the opposite of
  excitement is boredom. So many of us are bored, trudging through our best
  years in anticipation of the elusive retirement, failing to recognize that
  retirement is rarely as fulfilling as desired and an extended life sentence is
  not a promise. Designing a lifestyle NOW that serves you NOW should be the
  ultimate goal.


  Here are a couple ways Ferris suggests we can do that:


  1.  **Invest in self-care.** “By working only when you are most effective,
  life is both more productive and more enjoyable.”

  2.  **Less is more.** “Focus on being productive instead of busy.”

  3.  **The time is now.** “The Timing is never right, if it’s important to you
  and you want to do it ‘eventually’, just do it and correct course along the
  way.”

  4.  **Ask for forgiveness, not permission.** “Get good at being a troublemaker
  and saying sorry when you really screw up.”

  5.  **Play up your strengths.** “Focus on better use of your best weapons
  instead of constant repair.”

  6.  **Do what you want.** “…Opposed to what you feel obligated to do”.

  7.  **Time is money.** Focus on relative income, which accounts for time and
  dollar. Rather than absolute income that focuses only on the dollar amount.
f_conclusion: >-
  Ferriss is radical, no question about it. He argues for his readers to abandon
  a lifetime of conditioning in favor of living a life of adventure, fulfillment
  and happiness. But he is persuasive, offering experience, arguments founded on
  convincing evidence and a book jam packed with thought starters and tools to
  get started NOW. While his ideals may differ from the wider population and his
  journey may appear selfish, his readers cannot argue with the very obvious
  examples of time wasted and energy ill spent in a life that is not promised.

  world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming
  for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals"

> "Understand something: in order to get to the next level of whatever you’re doing, you must think and act in a wildly different way than you previously have been. You cannot get to the next phase of a project without a grander mind-set, more acceleration, and extra horsepower." _\- The 10X Rule, page 3_

If you tend to shoot for what you perceive to be reachable, practical, do-able and realistic goals in your business and personal life, _The 10X Rule_ will be a book that will make you uncomfortable and may not be for you. Or it could be vitally important in transforming all aspects of your life.

Author Grant Cardone is only concerned with ‘extreme success’ and **if you are not fully, totally willing to push beyond the merely everyday average, he would prefer that you … well, get the hell out of his way and go back to your careful, good enough world.** The concept of average and its acceptance in so many areas of everyday life is what has brought us such a large middle class with millions of people unwilling and disinclined to set targets beyond ‘good enough’.

Cardone labels his “10X Rule” with an adhesive application that it can be applied to all areas of your life – spiritual, physical, mental, emotional, familial and financial. Having big goals is not going to cut it in business today and **none of us should be willing accept the existence of mediocre players in any area of your life** that will limit your own abilities to accomplish ‘10X results’. We need to take a-c-t-i-o-n. Massive action. In any moment, inside any action that you undertake, it is imperative that you take ‘10X’ more action than you normally take _inside that very moment_. Let’s see how this can be achieved.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Massive Action on Steroids

> "Assume that every project you attempt will take more time, money, energy, effort, and people than you can imagine. Multiply every expectation by 10, and you will probably be safe. And if doesn’t take 10 times more than anticipated, great. It is better to be pleasantly surprised than greatly disappointed."- The 10X Rule, page 17

The first step in exceptional results is to set clear targets that are 10X what you think it will take to accomplish the task. We rarely begin our work and assess what could be accomplished inside a full, inspired commitment to push past necessary efforts – we default to looking at ‘just what needs to be done’. The result is mediocrity and continually lower levels of acceptable results. Take the time to ask what specific work is going to be required and set a 10X level. Once that level is set, you must be across-the-board, fully committed to not reduce the target. If anything, when confronted by doubts or initial setbacks, you must default to taking _more massive action_. While you’re at it, abolish the idea that the concept of success must be restricted and has a limit, a ceiling through which nothing further can be accomplished.

“Tackle (every) project with the 10X Rule – like your life depends on it,” writes Cardone. “Manage every action as though you have a camera on it. **Pretend you’re being recorded as a model by which your children and grandchildren will learn how to succeed in life**”.

Please. Re-read the above quote. _Soak and marinate in it._

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Average is a Formula for Losers

> "Anything conducted in standard amounts simply won’t get the job done. The normal levels of action at which most people operate fail to take into account the effects of various forces – such as gravity, age, resistance, timing and the unexpected…people will try and take from you what they are unable to create themselves… succeed so big that no one person or event or series of missteps can take you down! Average levels of anything will fail you – or at the very least, put you at risk!"- The 10X Rule, page 63

**Our society is addicted to averages.** We collect data, establish reasonable levels of results that are ‘good enough’ and put our children into educational systems that apply sliding scales of low achievement and possibility. The acceptance of a discussion of average when looking at what is possible snuffs the life out of human capability and cuts off access to quantum science and thinking. Any area of our life where we bring ‘average amount of attention to will start to subside and will eventually cease to exist.’

Cardone implores the reader to look up the word average. If you allow the practical meaning of the word’s meaning to sink into your life, be prepared for a big slide when the eventual downturn that life brings to us all occurs. Applying the 10X Rule allows you push through and past most of the difficulties and setbacks that life may bring.

Oh yeah. Want to know that the definition of average encumbers? **Typical, ordinary, common.** Imagine your children applying those words to your life and character and get ready to seriously take the exhortations of _The 10X Rule_ to heart.

### SUCCESS is your duty

> "It is not enough just to play the game; it is vital that you learn to win at it. Winning – over and over again – at everything in which you involve yourself ensures that you will be able to further expand. And it guarantees that both you and your ideas will survive into the future."- The 10X Rule, page 23

You’ve heard it – and you’ve probably said it. “Success is a journey, not a destination.” Cardone would like to extend to anyone uttering this inanity a sharp, back-handed slap espousing this limp quasi-wisdom to anyone who may hear it. Winning empowers and ensures that your future efforts will continue to expand and, thus, reach the levels of 10X results. **Success is a duty to ourselves.** Our education system, to our young children and young adults, does not allow an understanding or even discussion of the importance of success. Success has become an ‘option’ – and we end up with average, with no understanding of what excellence could be and what we are capable of accomplishing.

_“If you consider it your duty to live up to your potential, then you simply won’t.”_ Cardone is clear. The kind of success we should desire in all areas of our lives comes about as a result of “mental and spiritual claims to own it, followed by taking the necessary actions over time until it is acquired.” **It is your moral obligation and responsibility to your work, your family, and your future to commit to success.**

The “X” factor in the _The 10X Rule_ is in the power of ‘the now’. You can access what’s happened in the past and feel free to get clear on the future you want, but the mindset that you must hardwire into every moment is the vital, massive importance that the true power is in taking massive action … now. “Show up, be all in, and trust that creativity follows commitment.” Success is not about intelligence, understanding, economics or who you know, it’s about understanding that taking massive action inside _The 10X Rule_ will create a life of which you are called to become. Think 10X levels and take 10X actions.
