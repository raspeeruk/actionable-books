  ### Always Say Less Than Necessary


  > "When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the
  more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying
  something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and
  sphinx like. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more
  you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish."- The 48 Laws of
  Power, page 31


  This The Big Idea is Law 4. It is human nature to need to explain and
  interpret what others are thinking. The less you reveal, the more profound and
  mysterious you seem. The mystery is alluring, and others will want to find out
  more. Revealing too much makes you appear ordinary and foolish. This idea is
  also an important component of many other laws. It is important to drive the
  imagination of others to maintain their interest. Learn to control your words
  and emotions. Greene warns, “Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The
  momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by
  the price you pay.” Words are like currency: the shorter the supply the
  greater the value. They can be used lavishly and foolishly, or with careful
  parsimony, but once used we cannot revoke them.

  ### Get to Know People


  > "The ability to measure people and know who you’re dealing with is the most
  important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it you are
  blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose the wrong
  types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when you are
  actually insulting them."- The 48 Laws of Power, page 143


  People come from different backgrounds and have diverse goals, experiences,
  wants, and needs. If you treat everyone alike, you will miss connecting with
  their true desires and motivations. If you rely on instincts, you reveal your
  personal perspective. Appearances are deceiving: people may project an image
  opposite of their true nature. Remember the The Big Idea and keep your words
  in short supply. People will fill the silence with information about
  themselves. People are self-interested and usually eager for self-expression.
  The confidence also builds trust.


  Anyone can become more powerful by cultivating an understanding of others and
  learning to control their emotions. We can begin by controlling our words. The
  less we say, the more powerful we appear and the more we can learn about
  others. The mystery is enticing, but restrain anger it is repelling. Angry
  people are difficult to take seriously, and they appear childish. By saying
  less, we also get to know more about others. First impressions (and
  appearances) are often deceiving. The less we say, the more likely others are
  to reveal the truth about themselves.

  ### Control Your Anger


  > "Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems
  out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seriously,
  exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They have become
  so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take it
  personally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify
  power."- The 48 Laws of Power, page 329


  Tantrums are the way children express anger because they are powerless and
  their only option is to become desperately hysterical. When adults become
  outwardly angry, they may be intimidating initially but after the outburst
  people interpret the display as a sign of helplessness. Angry people lose our
  respect. The answer is not to repress our anger but to change our perspective.
  Remember the The Big Idea and control your expression of anger. Realize the
  source of your anger is much broader than the event that triggered it. Then
  shift your perspective and realize in the social realm nothing should be taken
  personally.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book divulges much more about the dynamics of power and human nature. It
  is famous for endorsing the unprincipled use of power. Countless examples
  prove a noble motive is unnecessary for domination. However, we must remain
  outwardly civilized even if we are indirectly manipulative and deceptive.
  Understanding this duplicity enables us to use power to our advantage and
  defend ourselves against it.
f_quote-2: >-
  “If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it,
  there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you
  powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling
  against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it
  is far better to excel at power.”

> "Commitment is a statement of what is. From our perspective, you can know your commitments by your results, not by what you say your commitments are. We are all committed. Conscious leaders own their commitments by owning their results." _\- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, location 303_

I was first introduced to Jim Dethmer, one of the three co-authors of _The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership_ (and the co-founder of the Conscious Leader Group) in an online coaching course I was taking. I now use the terminology and practices that he shared in that class—and that are beautifully captured in this book—in almost all the work I do with my clients.

This is not a book designed to be read once—or at one time. Each commitment requires significant practice and is worthy of frequent review. The book provides many practices to work with—all of which are simultaneously accessible and challenging. After introducing the core terminology (which I’ll focus on in this summary,) the authors devote one chapter to each of the 15 increasingly demanding commitments referenced in the title.

Living these commitments requires us to become more truthful, more aware of when we are not living them, and more adept at shifting states so that we can live them more fully. That is the meaning of being conscious. The authors make an important distinction between what we “want to be” (e.g., “wanting to be thinner”) and what we are “willing to be” (e.g., “willing to actually lose the weight”)—the difference often being hard work and profound honesty. They emphasize, as in the quote above, that our commitments are lived, measured by results, rather than desired.

The rewards of conscious leadership are as much for ourselves as they are for our organizations. The more we work at becoming conscious, the greater the possibility of living creative, curious and productive lives—of achieving the results we really want.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Are you Above the Line or Below the Line?

> "We suggest that the first mark of conscious leaders is self-awareness and the ability to tell themselves the truth. It matters far more that leaders can accurately determine whether they are above or below the line in any moment than where they actually are."- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, location 239

The model at the core of this book is exceptionally simple. It’s a horizontal line. At any given moment, we are either above or below that line. When we are below the line, we are in a defensive and closed posture, committed to being right. We are in a “to me” state—the world acts upon us. When we are above the line, we are curious, wanting to learn. Below the line everything is very serious; above the line, there is humor. When we are above the line, we’re in a “by me” state—we are authoring our lives.

The first step in becoming a conscious leader is learning to locate yourself either above or below the line. All 15 commitments introduced in this book have two versions—one that operates from above the line (e.g., taking full responsibility) and another that operates from the below line (e.g., looking to place blame.)

If we are not conscious—not aware—we will gravitate below the line and not even notice that most of our time is spent there. We’ll wonder why we aren’t getting the results we want. Conscious leaders go below the line all the time. They also quickly notice it, accept where they are, and learn to shift to being above the line.

The first step in becoming a conscious leader is to get familiar with what each location feels like. Noticing and naming your feelings, your thoughts, your beliefs and your motivations are among the practices that you’ll learn. With even this introduction, you can already begin. Where are you?

Note: For a wonderful introduction, check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqzYDZAqCI) from the authors.

### Learning to Shift

> "Leaders are always drifting and shifting. Shifting is the master skill of all conscious leaders."- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, location 817

While shifting is the master skill, it’s not really all that hard. Once we recognize that we’re below the line, genuinely accept it, and are willing to shift, the most powerful thing we can do is make a physical shift—change our body chemistry.

How do we do that? The authors provide two simple techniques.

**Technique #1: Conscious Breathing**In a threatened state, we tend to hold our breath or breathe shallowly. Conscious breaths break the hold of that reactive state. The method offered up here is simple:

“Four conscious breaths with a four second inhale and a four second exhale deep into our belly literally shift our blood chemistry and breathing pattern.”

**Technique #2: Shifting Posture  
**When we’re in a defensive state and committed to being right more than to learning, our body assumes a specific pose. While we may not be aware of this at first, it’s actually not hard to identify a defensive posture. Try it now! Then, just shifting your posture can help you to shift your state. This can mean stepping away, walking for a minute or two, just shifting back if you’re leaning in (if you can’t actually get up and move around.) Try it, it’s kind of amazing!

The bottom line: Shifting perspective is much, much easier after you’ve shifted your physical state.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Speak Unarguably—Listen with Curiosity

> "Great leaders and teams become experts at revealing their unarguable experience (‘I’m having a thought…’) without forming any attachment to being right about it… When this candor is met with curiosity and deep listening ‘Tell me more about that thought. I’m curious to know what you think,’ amazing breakthroughs of insight and innovation often occur."- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, location 1360

Candor is a key to conscious leadership and living above the line. Withholding keeps us below the line. However, conscious leaders do more than simply reveal rather than withhold. They speak unarguably. Sentences that begin with “I’m having the thought that…” or “I feel…” or “I am sensing…” are, by definition, inarguable. In other words: “that the thought occurred is unarguable. That the thought is true or right is highly arguable.”

As we learn to speak what is true for us, recognizing that it is not necessarily right, and as we learn to listen to others, knowing that they are speaking their truths (and that we can be curious about those truths) we can extract ourselves from a pattern that we are often stuck in—the drama triangle. When we are convinced of our “rightness” we will typically find ourselves oscillating among the roles of hero, victim or villain. For an introduction to the triangle—and its conscious alternative—here’s another great little [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovrVv_RlCMw) from the Conscious Leadership Group.

It’s challenging to summarize a book that offers as much as this one. I hope that you explore both the book and the videos, and that you find it as useful and meaningful as I have. While being a conscious leader and human being may not be easy, it’s also not that hard if we practice. Using this book as a practice manual is a great way to start!
