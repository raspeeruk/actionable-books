  ### It's All About the Attitude!


  > "The right attitude is the best and most obvious path to success and yet the
  least chosen one."- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 480


  While all of us have our good and bad days, some people choose to see the
  positive and carry on despite the disappointments they have had. The reality
  is, there will always be things that don’t go your way—your car breaks down,
  someone yells at you because they are also having a bad day, you spill coffee
  down your suit on the way to a meeting, etc. However, we each have the
  opportunity to react to each of these things positively or negatively. In
  fact, **Brock encourages us to see something great in even the worst of these
  circumstances.** Maybe your car breaking down will lead you to meet someone
  new. Maybe your listening patiently to the person who has had a bad day will
  cause them to rethink their attitude. **You can’t force others to see the
  positive, but you can change the way you react to each circumstance,
  moment-by-moment, day-to-day.**


  “The things that go wrong can be the defining moments of your life.”

  ### Have Faith


  > "Whatever it is you dream, simply believe that it is entirely possible. If
  you cannot believe that it is possible every day of the week, then believe
  that it’s possible on every Tuesday or every Friday."- The 8 Pillars of
  Motivation, page 621


  I love this idea that even if it’s difficult for you to believe that something
  is possible all of the time, then to at least try and believe it’s possible as
  often as you can. There are times when I don’t let myself believe my dreams
  could come true, but this makes it much more doable. Once you believe that
  things are a possibility, you’re much more likely to put steps in place to
  accomplish them. For instance, maybe you don’t believe you could run a
  successful business, but maybe once a week, you set up an event on your
  calendar to work on that goal. During that time put aside your thoughts – that
  you don’t think it is a possibility – and act as though it is. Maybe you’ll
  surprise yourself by making it a reality with just an hour of focus a week or
  maybe, with time, you can increase that hour of belief into an entire day.


  Put the eight pillars to use in your life, and you’ll be well on your way to
  never losing motivation again. From defining your purpose and direction to
  cultivating smart habits, you’ll be paving the road to your dreams coming
  true.  

  What habits can you put in place tomorrow that will give you the motivation to
  accomplish your dreams ten, twenty, or thirty years down the road?

  ### It Takes a Village


  > "Engage in the right place and build the relationships and be sure to give,
  give, give and then give some more."- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 601


  Sometimes just having the right support system in place can make all the
  difference. If you surround yourself with a lot of naysayers who tell you your
  ideas won’t work, you’ll likely eventually listen. However, if you cultivate
  relationships with people who encourage you to go for your dreams, you are
  much more inclined to try. Brock also tells a personal story about her
  grandmother that shows that just because someone doesn’t understand why you
  are doing something doesn’t mean that they don’t care about you. Brock was
  trying to explain her work in social media and blogging to her grandmother,
  which her grandmother in Iran did not understand, so she told her grandmother
  that she was happy and her grandmother accepted that answer much easier than
  trying to grasp what she did for a living.


  Brock writes, **“Often it is not that the people who do not support you don’t
  want you to be happy; they simply do not understand what it is you are trying
  to do.”**


  So find people who care about you and what you are doing and, at the same
  time, encourage others in what they are doing—even if you do not fully
  understand why they want what they want.

f_quote-2: >-
  "I believe that motivation happens as a result of smart habits and not the
  other way around. You do not need to first get motivated to start a new habit
  in your life. The more sensible order is to start a habit so that it acts as a
  motivation."

> "The 2020 workplace will be fluid, diverse in age and ethnicity, flexible, collaborative, mobile, global, and above all, hyperconnected. Get ready to live it." _\- The 2020 Workplace, page 233_

_The 2020 Workplace_ is a must read book that maps outs what innovative companies should do to attract, develop and retain great talent by highlighting real-world organisations already working towards becoming tomorrow’s workplace of choice.

Observing increased pressure within businesses’ operations to balance multi-generational employees working with evolving digital technologies, the authors Jeanne C. Meister and Karie Willyerd, founders of Future Workplace and experts in recruitment, have written _The 2020 Workplace_ to help workplace transformation.

Combining insights from their exclusive “_The Generations @ Work_” and “_Workplace of the Future_” surveys; together with findings from more than 50 leading-edge case studies, it is packed with best-practice tips and strategies centred around talent management, learning and development and leadership practices to give businesses a competitive edge.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Age diversity is a good thing

> "Employers who adapt the fastest to a multigenerational workforce will be able to attract the highest-quality employees when the war for talent is in full swing."- The 2020 Workplace, page 44

So here’s the thing. The generation balance in your company is changing right now. That means you need to explore the challenges of having an age-diverse workforce coexisting in the workplace. You need to consider the best way to develop company-wide support for the different communication styles, career aspirations and collective knowledge sharing benefits that a diverse workplace will bring.

According to the authors’ extensive research, innovative companies successfully working towards an environment focused on talent management are offering new future employees of all ages and backgrounds (Generation 2020), a deeply personalised and engaging work experience, putting their business at a distinct advantage in the new world of work headed our way.

Here’s a snapshot of the five generations that Meister and Willyerd believe will be actively collaborating in our 2020 workplace.

1.  **Traditionalists**: Fiercely loyal workers born before 1946 who defined innovation by the arrival of the fax machine.
2.  Born between 1946 and 1964, the **Baby Boomers** are influenced by events like Woodstock and the JFK assassination, while the personal computer was a key technological moment for them.
3.  **Generation X**, the self-reliant group representing 1965-1976, were exposed to MTV, the AIDS epidemic and the invention of the mobile phone.
4.  **Millennials**: hard-wired into technology since birth (1977-1997), their digital skills are inherent.
5.  **Generation 2020** are approximately 15 years of age today and have grown up in a hyper connected world.

Consider your workplace diversity. What do your co-workers care most about at work? Findings from the _The 2020 Workplace_ reveal that members of all these generations have three distinct, common needs. They want to feel valued, empowered and engaged at work. They need their business leaders to feel confident in their ability and effectiveness in their designated roles and job functions.

Getting your company’s multi-generational workplace transformation underway begins with understanding the ten forces shaping the future workplace today. These include:

*   Shifting workplace demographics
*   The knowledge economy
*   Globalisation
*   The digital workplace
*   The ubiquity of mobile technology
*   A culture of connectivity
*   The participation society
*   Social learning
*   Corporate social responsibility
*   Millennials in the workplace

Diversity is a great thing. Businesses who can make it a priority to appreciate the individual characteristics of each generation and find a way to successfully communicate with different employees will be having a positive impact on future employer-employee relationships.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Build (and share) a social media strategy

> "Creating an environment that is collaborative, authentic, personalised, innovative and social, requires leaders whose management behaviours create and reinforce that environment."- The 2020 Workplace, page 187

It’s incredible to think that there are still companies around the globe restricting their employees’ access to social network sites. The authors reason that businesses who continue to enforce complete lockdowns will definitely impact profitable recruitment of top talent, while forward-thinking companies will “attract new employees, develop new skillsets, support team knowledge sharing, drive collaboration and improve innovation” by leveraging the power of social media.

Why do you need a social media strategy for future success? Simple. At the time of publication, two-thirds of the total global internet population were members of a social network. In fact, a 2009 Nielson Online report in the book reveals that web-based communities and blog content is now more popular than email as a form of communication.

_Uber-connecting_ your organisation is a fantastic concept. The foundation for successfully connecting your employees is ensuring you have a sound strategy in place and you can get started today by using Future Workplace’s easy 7-step framework:

1.  **Strategy** > Identify business drivers
2.  **Alignment** > Form a coalition of stakeholders
3.  **Choices** > Host a social media boot camp
4.  **Implement** > Create a launch plan
5.  **Fast Start** > Develop a pilot offering
6.  **Communicate** > Design a communication plan
7.  **Measurement** > Agree on metrics

Without doubt, identifying what your company wants to achieve (step 1) by starting on this journey, will be the single most important step of your social media strategy. _Uber-connection_ will absolutely change the way work is done within your business. You will be offering your team the opportunity to be social via an interactive, real-time, engaging environment.

We know that Gen Xers and Millennials bring digital expectations to the workplace. So it makes complete sense, heading towards 2020, for you to introduce and drive social technologies in your workplace that encourage employees of all ages and qualifications to have conversations with each other, share ideas and experience, brainstorm new products and services, and proactively contribute to business proposals and initiatives driving business growth.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Be socially responsible

> "The quickest way to kill your brand is to communicate externally something that does not resonate internally…"- The 2020 Workplace, page 84

Just as social interaction is driving learning, corporate philanthropy is now business-driven and integrated into the social, ethical and environmental agendas of many companies. This is known as corporate social responsibility (CSR).

Commitment to CSR was one of the top ten factors that influenced all generations’ choice about a potential employer according to the Future Workplace “_The Generations @Work_” survey.

To build your reputation as a brand whom future employees will feel certain prioritises being socially responsible, start by selecting a specific social issue (if you don’t already have one) and then highlight your company’s ongoing obligation to CSR as part of your core business strategy, not just a gimmick. Be clear on what your CSR is, define how success and effectiveness is measured and be inspiring in the way you communicate your commitment.

As an alternative CSR approach, create a policy that allows employees a set amount of days in personal time each year to volunteer with an organisation of their choice. This option will encourage people and teams to share how they are giving back to the community, visibly positioning your brand’s reputation as being invested in not-for-profit programs.

In the workplace of 2020, an increased focus on people, planet and profits, also known as the _triple bottom line_, will become a key element for businesses to appeal to and keep hold of new hires.

_The 2020 Workplace_ was published in 2010, and you will notice that some of the USA-centric reference points and “trend” mentions are outdated largely due to our technological, hyper-connected world that is moving so fast. However, the authors’ acknowledgement that “there’s little that can be said with certainty about the future except this: sometime over the next decade your company will be challenged in a way for which it has no precedent” rings true as we head towards 2020, a mere four years away. Is your business ready?
