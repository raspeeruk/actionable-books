  ### Start Your Day Off on the Right Foot


  > "Beginning your day right is indispensable for accomplishing your goals."-
  The 5 AM Club, page 17


  A good, healthy, happy start to your day leads to a good, healthy, happy day.
  You have within your control the ability to set the tone for your day. You can
  make it positive or negative, based on how you start.


  The snooze bar is your enemy. You have to get up right away if you are going
  to get up refreshed. The snooze button allows you to drowse in bed, not
  accomplishing anything more than allowing your body to start into another
  sleep cycle. Ten minutes later, you are feeling even more tired when the alarm
  goes off for the second time.


  As soon as you get up you have to hydrate your body Give yourself an hour,
  however, before you eat. Your body slows when it is digesting food and you
  don’t want to start your day sluggish. Take care of your physical needs right
  away – ablutions, exercise, whatever you need to get your energy flowing.


  Now that you are up and energized, it’s time to work on your goals. Don’t
  waste time on trivial activities like emails or social media (unless some
  aspect of it is critical to your goal work – even then, don’t get sucked into
  trivialities). Prioritize, evaluate and work on achieving your goals. So early
  in the day, you won’t be distracted by mundane aspects of work and life; you
  can dedicate yourself completely to the task at hand.


  This is also a time for emotional enrichment. Take time to enjoy the fresh
  morning air, listen to the birds singing, and watch the sun rise. Find
  enjoyment in nature, it is incredibly refreshing and renewing. Feel the joy of
  nature.


  All of these are suggestions about how to start your day the best way
  possible. That good start will frame the rest of your day.

  ### Organization is Important


  > "Our minds are freshest when we first wake up. By choosing to get things
  done at this magic hour in the morning you free yourself from the distractions
  of cell phones, friends, family, co-workers, and stress."- The 5 AM Club, page
  3


  You don’t want to waste your most productive time of day on trivial activities
  that could have been handled when you are not at peak performance. Peak time
  is for peak performance activities.


  So, how do we avoid getting dragged into mundane or stressful tasks when we
  want to focus on really important work? Eliminate the trivial work by getting
  it out of the way the night before. Get lunches prepped, get the kids school
  books organized and waiting by the door, have your own bag ready by the door,
  ensure keys and other items like glasses, etc. are all stored in the same
  location every time. Now, your morning won’t be filled with distractions that
  can waste time and cause you to feel stressed.


  Spend time during spare moments to create to-do lists and other memory
  triggers so that you won’t feel worried about them while trying to sleep or
  when you are at peak performance. Use those lists to reassure yourself that
  you don’t need to stress the next morning. You can also use your goal lists in
  order to be productive during your magic hour in the morning.

  ### Physical Wellbeing is Key


  > "Along with your diet and exercise, you should allocate sufficient time for
  sound sleep in a day."- The 5 AM Club, page 3


  You don’t expect your car to work well if you don’t keep it tuned up. The same
  applies to your body. Without maintenance and the right fuel, your body will
  not be able to do what you ask of it. Getting up early will be impossible.
  Working effectively throughout the day will be very difficult. Getting a good
  night’s sleep will not happen regularly. Thus begins a downward spiral that
  ensures it is even harder to keep your body maintained and properly fuelled in
  the future.


  Routine is valuable in keeping maintenance up. Listen to your body, pay
  attention to when it feels hungry, pay attention to how it acts during and
  after a meal (can you concentrate while eating? Do you feel sluggish after a
  meal? How do different foods affect you?). Set up your day to eat at times of
  maximum hunger and ensure you do not book critical things at times of low
  energy.


  Exercise is valuable to a healthy body. Again, listen to your body and do
  exercises that are suitable. Do exercises earlier in the day because exercise
  releases hormones in your body that make you feel energized and alert. If you
  do this just before bed, sleep will not come easily.

> "Once you open your mind to the possibility that there are laws of marketing, it’s easy to see what they are. In truth, they are obvious." _\- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, page xi_

Imagine the billions of dollars that have been wasted on marketing programs that don’t work. There is a perception that the answer to all marketing questions is the same: money. Al Ries and Jack Trout propose that more money has been wasted in marketing than any other human activity (outside of government activities).

The authors believe that, like there are laws of nature, there are also laws of marketing. After studying marketing principles and problems, they have distilled their findings into basic laws that govern success and failure. They call them the Immutable Laws of Marketing and there are 22 of them. Below is a brief summary of them all and then a closer look at just two.

Violate these laws at your own risk.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Basic Laws

> "There are laws of nature so why shouldn’t there be laws of marketing?"- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, page xi

What are the 22 laws?

1.  **Leadership** – it’s better to be first than it is to be better.
2.  **The category** – if you can’t be first in the category – set up a new category.
3.  **The mind** – it’s better to be first in the mind than the marketplace.
4.  **Perception** – people don’t care about your product, they care what it does for them.
5.  **Focus** – own a word in a prospect’s mind.
6.  **Exclusivity** – companies cannot own the same word in a prospect’s mind.
7.  **The ladder** – your strategy depends on which run you sit on the ladder.
8.  **Duality** – every market eventually becomes a two-horse race.
9.  **The opposite** – if shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader – don’t try to be better, be different.
10.  **Divisions** – over time a category will divide and become two or more categories.
11.  **Perspective** – marketing effects take place over an extended period of time.
12.  **Line extensions** – when you try to be all things to all people, you inevitably wind up in trouble.
13.  **Sacrifice** – you have to give up something in order to get something.
14.  **Attributes** – for every attribute there is an opposite, effective attribute.
15.  **Candor** – when you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a positive.
16.  **Singularity** – in each situation, only one move will give you the result.
17.  **Unpredictability** – you can’t predict the future.
18.  **Success** – can lead to arrogance which leads to failure.
19.  **Failure** – to be expected and accepted.
20.  **Hype** – situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the press.
21.  **Acceleration** – successful programs aren’t built on fads. They’re built on trends.
22.  **Resources** – without adequate funding, an idea won’t get off the ground.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### The Law of Perception

> "The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion."- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, page 19

Do you think that the best product will win? Many marketers, confident in this belief, are preoccupied with ‘getting the facts’. They analyze the situation to make sure they have the best product, then naively sail into the world with confidence.

It’s all an illusion says Ries and Trout. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the only reality.

Coca-Cola illustrated this for us when they thought best taste would lead to best-selling cola. Remember New Coke? It won the taste competition but the perception in the consumers’ minds was more important. The one that research showed tasted worst, Coca-Cola Classic, continues to outsell all the others. Perception is reality.

The tricky thing about perception is that we all think we are better perceivers than others. Only by accepting that you aren’t and studying how perceptions are formed and focusing your marketing on those perceptions can you overcome your incorrect marketing instincts.

### The Law of Success

> "Ego is the enemy of successful marketing."- The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, page 105

When people become successful, they tend to become less objective. They may substitute their own judgement for what the market wants. It reminds me of [Jim Collins](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/authors/jim-collins/)’ famous quote “Good is the enemy of great”. Success often leads to arrogance and arrogance to failure.

I work in the pharmaceutical industry trying to illuminate our path to patient centricity. One of the things I do is shift the mindset of sales reps to be focused on the patient instead of the prescription. The irony is that they will achieve greater sales when they are more patient focused.

But the old mindset of being script centric was founded in years and years of success. Now, while things are changing, the leaders insist people should “go back to basics”. They remember when old strategies were successful and they can’t take those blinders off to see a new approach is needed.

From the Law of Leadership to the Law of Resources, these valuable insights stand the test of time and offer guidance for anyone smart enough to look. The authors warn, however, about the dangers of applying the laws since many of them fly in the face of corporate ego, conventional wisdom and the Malcolm Baldrige awards. But with patience and courage, the laws will smooth your road to successful products.
