  ### The Core Formula


  > "Only when passion merges with a skill that other people value can you truly
  follow your passion to the bank."- The $100 Startup, page 51


  Passion is part of the microbusiness formula. But the formula itself is really
  no secret. Basically: **Follow your passion, but follow it with good business
  sense**. Turn your passion, or your skills, into a business model. Chris also
  states it point blank that if you’ve got people interested in what you do, but
  nothing to sell, then it’s not a business.


  It’s worth noting that not every passion or skillset may be desirable by
  itself. This is where Chris reminds us about **convergence**, where your
  passion, or skill set, intersects with what other people will find useful. If
  you can find ways to “package” your passion or repertoire into a product or
  service that an audience would find useful (i.e. solves their problem), then
  your opportunities become evident.


  Passion or Skill + Usefulness = Success


  or


  (PASSION + SKILL) –> (PROBLEM + MARKETING) = OPPORTUNITY


  It doesn’t get any simpler than that.


  If you’re starting out, ask yourself what you’re good at. What combination of
  skills can be converged with your audience? When you’ve defined that, you can
  continue figuring out the right audience and the right business model.

  ### A Bias Towards Action


  > "There's nothing wrong with planning. But you can spend a lifetime making a
  plan that never turns into action. In the battle between planning and action,
  action wins."- The $100 Startup, page 95


  Why is it that some people fail to get what they want, no matter how riled up
  one may be about freedom and independence? Guillebeau says that sometimes some
  people just want “the fun and sun” without the work in creating. Creating
  always entails _doing_.


  There’s also the danger with over planning. Here’s a brilliant question that
  Chris presents: _How do you know an idea is even marketable unless you bring
  it out there in the first place?_


  We live in a time when information can be accessed anywhere and instantly.
  Many business functions can be automated through the cloud. Microbusinesses
  can cost almost nothing to start, most times only costing a few hundred
  dollars. Ideas can be rapidly tested, launched, marketed, and scaled. If
  something goes awry, you can cut something out with minimal blowback.


  But without action – _actually creating something and testing your market idea
  –_ your dream is just wishful thinking. Your plan is just a theory.


  What’s being proposed is to **maintain a bias towards action.** Chris also
  calls this “planning as you go.”


  What entails planning as you go? It means to simply getting started now: Once
  you’ve figured out what convergence means for you, find out the [minimum
  viable product](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-lean-startup/)
  that it would take to launch. That way you can quickly test your market idea
  and swiftly adapt. You’ll also keep startup costs low, save money, and even
  heartache if things don’t turn out as expected. In a sense, you’re also
  “learning as you go.”


  Here are some other helpful tips that signify a bias towards action:


  **Limit your business mission to 140 characters:** You should be able to state
  in one sentence who you help and what the core benefit is. The length helps
  you state your purpose with clarity, and helps you avoid corporate-speak.


  **Keep any starting business plan to one-page max:** There’s a template on
  [100startup.com](http://100startup.com). Again, it helps narrow the details to
  the bare essentials like who you will serve, how’ll you do it, and what the
  elements of success will look like for you.


  **Achieve that first sale:** The initial feedback is also the most potent and
  gives you immediate clues on next actions.

  ### The Truth Behind Great Ideas


  > "What do people really, really want? At the end of the day, they want to be
  happy, and businesses that help their customers be happy are well-positioned
  to succeed."- The $100 Startup, page 39


  Inspiration from great ideas can come from anywhere. They may involve a hidden
  problem like an inefficiency in the market, or an opportunity seized from an
  emerging technology.


  One inspiring case study is Brett Kelly’s Evernote Essentials guide. Before it
  was released, there just wasn’t a single guide that clearly detailed how to
  use [Evernote](http://evernote.com/) to its full potential. At least for the
  English market. Brett was already a power user, and knowing the feeling of not
  having an explicit guide, he simply fulfilled that need for everyone else. The
  rest is history.


  Finding the right audience or target market entails something different, too.


  To find convergence between what we’re passionate about with what’s actually
  useful to others, Guillebeau notes that we should aim for a deeper
  understanding of our audiences. But it won’t have anything to do with
  traditional categories like age, gender or income.


  Instead, get back to what matters most: _the people you will serve._ Use the
  new demographics (or psychographics) to better understand who your target
  market may be. These traits include: interests, values, beliefs, skills, and
  even their passions.


  This is important because you’ll also gain insight into **what really matters
  to them**. Finally, you’ll land a better chance at what a problem looks like
  to _them_ — through _their_ eyes and through _their_ perspective. The more
  clarity you obtain here, the more you can design your product or service to be
  unique and useful, rather than another uninspiring “me-too”.


  Some good kick off questions that could lead you to inspiring ideas: What do
  young artists feel when using someone else’s product? What do users feel the
  most when using a particular web app for the first time? What pains busy
  professionals the most when it comes to learning something new? What do these
  people want more _of_, and less _of_?
f_conclusion: >-
  As far as the rest of the strategies and tactics in this toolbox, there’s
  plenty more to read and absorb. There’s a healthy balance here between
  inspiration and actionable business advice. Follow up those dreams and
  theories with your actions.

> "The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals" _\- The 4-Hour Workweek, page 51_

The \[North\] American dream waxes and wanes with political, social and economical shifts in society, but the goal remains consistent for most—work to live a life of comfort. The millennial generation is arguably the first to collectively demand more—more balance, more flexibility, more culture in the workplace. Timothy Ferris has taken it one step further in _The 4-Hour Workweek_ (TFHW) to suggest that the ultimate balance is obtained when work is the smallest portion of our week and our life is designed to bring us ultimate happiness and fulfillment. The book is equipped to serve as the ultimate how-to guide to abandoning the status quo and establishing an independence to work that many crave, stacked with instructions, real life testimonials and practical tools to apply to the reader’s unique situation.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Parkinson’s Law & The New Rich

> "The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility."- The 4-Hour Workweek, page 7

The story starts with burn out. Many experience it in pursuit of the ultimate goal: pulling longer hours in pursuit of movement, crafting meeting after meeting chasing visibility, sacrificing self-care in favor of self-promotion. Ferriss adamantly argues that it is all a myth, the 9-5 rat race is designed in such a way as to keep the wheel turning and the status quo protected. This is known as Parkinson’s Law, where “a task will swell in perceived importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion.” The arbitrary nature of 8 hours a day should have us questioning how each job and each unique industry conveniently fits into 40 hours per week, but when challenge strikes or a roadblock is presented the same worker can pump out their work in two hours in favor of attending to their sick children, or avoiding poor weather conditions. Ferriss suggests that when ultimate efficiency and effectiveness are re-introduced to the highest degree, meetings and phone calls become arbitrary, face time can be limited and 8 hours can be revered as overkill. When the work is at utmost efficiency, and living life at the forefront becomes the ultimate goal, you are considered part of The New Rich (NR).

As a reader, we are encouraged to question the model we find ourselves entrenched in and demand more. In order to live the life we want, rather than what is prescribed, we need to set limitations, work towards independence and utilize the ultimate currency of time and mobility.

### Design the Life You Want

> "Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all…’What would excite me?’"- The 4-Hour Workweek, page 51-52

So often we limit our own happiness or excitement by sticking to convention. Ferriss argues the synonym to happiness is excitement and the opposite of excitement is boredom. So many of us are bored, trudging through our best years in anticipation of the elusive retirement, failing to recognize that retirement is rarely as fulfilling as desired and an extended life sentence is not a promise. Designing a lifestyle NOW that serves you NOW should be the ultimate goal.

Here are a couple ways Ferris suggests we can do that:

1.  **Invest in self-care.** “By working only when you are most effective, life is both more productive and more enjoyable.”
2.  **Less is more.** “Focus on being productive instead of busy.”
3.  **The time is now.** “The Timing is never right, if it’s important to you and you want to do it ‘eventually’, just do it and correct course along the way.”
4.  **Ask for forgiveness, not permission.** “Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.”
5.  **Play up your strengths.** “Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair.”
6.  **Do what you want.** “…Opposed to what you feel obligated to do”.
7.  **Time is money.** Focus on relative income, which accounts for time and dollar. Rather than absolute income that focuses only on the dollar amount.

### Free Yourself Up

> "Set the rules in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle."- The 4-Hour Workweek, page 111

In order to live the lifestyle you have crafted, the next step is to free yourself of the limiting constraints of the 9-5 job. While Ferriss is quite adamant that the ideal would be self-employment with a very targeted product and buyer ship that can be guided and tweaked from anywhere, he has shared various ways of cutting through the mold and establishing more of what you want and it can all be simplified by using the 80/20 Principle.

“80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.” How often do we flip this on its head and lose sight of productivity and efficiency, investing 80% of our time and reaping only maybe 20% of the progress? This can manifest in useless meetings, lengthy email exchanges, needless conference calls or needy, low paying customers—there are countless examples of time and effort wasted in favor of filling the space and maintaining the status quo. By focusing on the 80/20 principle we are committing to ultimate efficiency in time and freeing ourselves up to live the life we ultimately crave.

Ferriss shares a couple of examples to uphold the 20% effort:

*   Limiting meetings and policing face time to reflect quick, decisive agendas.
*   Set an automatic response to indicate your priorities and manage expectations for your co-workers and customers.
*   Abandoning needy, low-paying customers and focusing on maintaining the heavier minority.
*   Do not multitask, rather prioritize and establish two primary goals for the day to achieve ultimate satisfaction.

Ferriss is radical, no question about it. He argues for his readers to abandon a lifetime of conditioning in favor of living a life of adventure, fulfillment and happiness. But he is persuasive, offering experience, arguments founded on convincing evidence and a book jam packed with thought starters and tools to get started NOW. While his ideals may differ from the wider population and his journey may appear selfish, his readers cannot argue with the very obvious examples of time wasted and energy ill spent in a life that is not promised.

Whether you buy-in or not, we can all do a little better to craft a life that is fulfilling and unique to our self prescribed goals.
