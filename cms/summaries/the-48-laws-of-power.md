  ### Understand Deeply


  > "Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don’t know
  forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding."- The 5 Elements
  of Effective Thinking, page 35


  Mastering the basics of a topic is the key to understanding something deeply.
  Do you know the basics of the subject you’re trying to master? Can you write a
  detailed description of the foundations of a topic from the top of your head?
  The authors posit that many professionals who have reached the top of their
  field are true masters of the fundamentals in their particular area of
  specialty. As Burger and Starbird proclaim “Rock solid understanding is the
  foundation for success.”


  Burger and Starbird believe that you can improve the basics by listing the
  specific components of the skill or subject you’re trying to learn and
  spending some time improving your mastery of one of the items. Identifying
  gaps in your knowledge can also increase your awareness and improve
  understanding. Being honest about what you don’t know can lead you to act on
  closing the knowledge gap.


  A useful strategy recommended by Burger and Starbird is to understand a small
  piece of a problem or issue. Understanding the sub-issue deeply can help solve
  the bigger problem. When faced with a problem, focus on something you know and
  can solve.


  The authors also believe that knowing the sources of your opinions on a topic
  are instrumental to enhancing your comprehension. Ask yourself, “How do I
  know?” What evidence is your opinion based on? Don’t take things for granted.
  Look deep inside and find the source of your opinion or belief and question
  its authenticity and validity.

  ### Question Everything


  > "The right questions clarify your understanding and focus your attention on
  features that matter."- The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, page 88


  Asking good questions can lead to deeper understanding by exposing gaps in our
  knowledge and can focus our attention on the right issues. The authors believe
  that questions help you “explore the limits of your understanding” and help to
  clarify what needs to be done, which increases effective action.


  One way to use questioning as an aid to understanding is to teach the topic
  (the authors refer to it as “teach to learn”). You don’t have to physically
  teach the material but prepare for it as if you were teaching it. Teaching a
  subject makes you focus on what the key concepts are and highlights the
  knowledge gaps and what you need to work on. It also compels you to come up
  with questions and examples.


  They also suggest that we look for ways to improve the question. Asking the
  right questions helps you focus on the correct issues, which can help reveal
  hidden assumptions and expose weaknesses. They provide an example of a student
  trying to improve their grades and the importance of asking the relative
  question. Rather than asking “How to get better grades,” the correct question
  should be “How can I learn to think better and understand more deeply?”


  Asking questions before an assignment or project can also enhance
  understanding. This is helpful because it focuses your attention on the core
  issues. Keep asking yourself “What is the goal of this task” or “What is the
  benefit?”

  ### To Improve Your Odds of Success, Fail


  > "Understanding what doesn’t work and why is valuable knowledge."- The 5
  Elements of Effective Thinking, page 62


  Although it sounds counterintuitive, research and history suggests that
  failure is a valuable stepping stone to success. The authors provide many
  examples of successful individuals who’ve failed many times before achieving
  success. Asking ourselves, “Why something is wrong” can pinpoint gaps in the
  solution. It is not the errors themselves that prove beneficial but the
  process of correcting mistakes that improve the odds of finding a solution.


  When writing out a solution, the authors encourage us to focus on two factors;
  what’s right and what’s wrong. They provide an example of a math student in
  one of their classes and how they guide her from her wrong answers to the
  correct ones. They describe the process as making an attempt at a solution,
  finding the flaw, fixing it and starting the process over again. As the
  authors note, “Mistakes present a great opportunity to learn and improve, but
  action is required. “Once you’ve learned from your mistakes, it’s time to
  start asking better questions.
f_conclusion: >-
  Following the advice in this valuable book will improve your thinking. The
  skill sets and exercises highlighted by the authors form the foundation to
  master anything anyone wants to learn and should be taught to all students in
  school.

  “You can understand anything better than you currently do. Setting a higher
  standard for yourself for what you mean by understanding can revolutionize how
  you perceive the world”

> “If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of struggling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling guilty, it is far better to excel at power.” _\- The 48 Laws of Power, page xix_

Robert Greene meticulously unravels the threads of the tapestry of over 3,000 years of world history to distill the essence of power, identifying common themes and consolidating their wisdom into _The 48 Laws of Power_. His assertion is that certain actions always increase our power while other measures compromise our power or destroy us. Like the laws of physics, the laws of human nature are unconditional. We must acquire essential skills and knowledge to understand people and master our emotions. Learning the rules enables us to both use power potently, and protect ourselves from it.

The 48 Laws are separate and concise; they are also interconnected and applicable to many situations. Greene demonstrates the principles of the laws using writing by the greatest masters of power in history. Depending on our situation all of the laws may apply at some point. Some common threads include: understanding people are self-oriented, people want to validate their dreams, the mysterious is alluring, the familiar is trustworthy, and appearances are more convincing than facts. Other ideas include: remain autonomous but stay connected, avoid others problems and the troublemakers, and success takes hard work, but it is powerful to make it seem effortless. There is much more and a lifetime of practicing these 48 Laws would be necessary for proficiency.

For this summary, I want to focus on how our overuse of words and emotions can erode power.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Always Say Less Than Necessary

> "When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, and sphinx like. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish."- The 48 Laws of Power, page 31

This The Big Idea is Law 4. It is human nature to need to explain and interpret what others are thinking. The less you reveal, the more profound and mysterious you seem. The mystery is alluring, and others will want to find out more. Revealing too much makes you appear ordinary and foolish. This idea is also an important component of many other laws. It is important to drive the imagination of others to maintain their interest. Learn to control your words and emotions. Greene warns, “Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The momentary satisfaction you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by the price you pay.” Words are like currency: the shorter the supply the greater the value. They can be used lavishly and foolishly, or with careful parsimony, but once used we cannot revoke them.

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Control Your Anger

> "Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seriously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They have become so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take it personally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power."- The 48 Laws of Power, page 329

Tantrums are the way children express anger because they are powerless and their only option is to become desperately hysterical. When adults become outwardly angry, they may be intimidating initially but after the outburst people interpret the display as a sign of helplessness. Angry people lose our respect. The answer is not to repress our anger but to change our perspective. Remember the The Big Idea and control your expression of anger. Realize the source of your anger is much broader than the event that triggered it. Then shift your perspective and realize in the social realm nothing should be taken personally.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Get to Know People

> "The ability to measure people and know who you’re dealing with is the most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it you are blind: Not only will you offend the wrong people, you will choose the wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when you are actually insulting them."- The 48 Laws of Power, page 143

People come from different backgrounds and have diverse goals, experiences, wants, and needs. If you treat everyone alike, you will miss connecting with their true desires and motivations. If you rely on instincts, you reveal your personal perspective. Appearances are deceiving: people may project an image opposite of their true nature. Remember the The Big Idea and keep your words in short supply. People will fill the silence with information about themselves. People are self-interested and usually eager for self-expression. The confidence also builds trust.

Anyone can become more powerful by cultivating an understanding of others and learning to control their emotions. We can begin by controlling our words. The less we say, the more powerful we appear and the more we can learn about others. The mystery is enticing, but restrain anger it is repelling. Angry people are difficult to take seriously, and they appear childish. By saying less, we also get to know more about others. First impressions (and appearances) are often deceiving. The less we say, the more likely others are to reveal the truth about themselves.

This book divulges much more about the dynamics of power and human nature. It is famous for endorsing the unprincipled use of power. Countless examples prove a noble motive is unnecessary for domination. However, we must remain outwardly civilized even if we are indirectly manipulative and deceptive. Understanding this duplicity enables us to use power to our advantage and defend ourselves against it.
