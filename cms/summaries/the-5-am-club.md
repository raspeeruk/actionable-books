  ### 11 Laws


  > "What makes each of us likable is distinct to us. But the basic drivers of
  likability are the same for us all."- The 11 Laws of Likability, page 6


  **What makes you likable is different than what makes me likable.** But the
  basic drivers of likability, Lederman says, are the same for all of us. She
  calls them the 11 laws of likability and breaks them down into 3 categories.
  She then takes an in depth look at each of the laws and how you can enhance
  them both personally and professionally. As you read their brief summaries
  below, think about which ones you’ve mastered and which ones need more
  attention.


  **A. Before the Conversation: Get Real**


  1\. The law of authenticity – the real you is the best you


  2\. The law of self-image – before others will like you, you have to like
  yourself


  3\. The law of perception – how you perceive others is your reality about them
  and the same is true for them of you


  4\. The law of energy – energy is contagious – what we project, we receive


  **B. The Conversation: Always Have It**


  1\. The law of curiosity – curiosity leads to connections


  2\. The law of listening – others won’t understand you until they feel heard
  and understood


  3\. The law of similarity – people like people like them


  4\. The law of mood memory – people are more likely to remember how you made
  them feel than what you said


  **C. After the Conversation: Build a Relationship**


  1\. The law of familiarity – people feel comfortable with who and what they
  know


  2\. The law of giving: give first – do because you can


  3\. The law of patience – with time, things happen

  ### Energy is contagious


  > "When we understand that energy is something we create, we can work on
  driving the energy rather than having it drive us."- The 11 Laws of
  Likability, page 71


  Before we talk about how to improve your energy, let’s first look at what it
  is and why it is important. Energy is derived from your personality and your
  actual mood in that moment. People subconsciously read your energy through
  cues you give them from your body, your face, your stance, even in the way you
  are breathing. Some people pick up on it better than others. But the signals
  are there for the taking. My daughters, for example, have an uncanny ability
  to sense and mirror my energy.


  And that leads to why it is so important that we are aware of and manage our
  energy. **Energy is contagious.** With your energy you can energize or deflate
  other people. You can contribute to productivity or add to confusion. It
  affects your ability to connect and interact with others.


  **To put it bluntly, with energy, like other things, you get what you give.**


  How often do you stop to think about what kind of energy you are projecting?
  Before you walk in the front door at the end of a long day, or before you
  enter your boss’s office or your client’s office, it is worth your effort to
  ask yourself the following questions:


  1\. Where is my energy?  

  2\. Where is the other person’s energy?  

  3\. What energy knowledge do I have about me and about the energy expectations
  that exist between me and the other person?


  Instead of settling on just getting what you get from the person, choreograph
  it a bit by altering your energy state. You will be amazed at how that energy
  comes back. As a professional speaker I am very aware that my audience’s
  energy will never rise above mine; raise my energy and they magically mirror
  it!


  Caveat: Don’t worry. Projecting positive energy does not mean you have to
  carry Pom Pom’s around! No cheerleading is required! **Authentic positive
  energy is far more likable than trying to be the peppiest in the room.**


  When you meet a new person, do you ever catch yourself thinking “What good
  would this connection be for me?” Building successful relationships starts
  with abandoning this conventional me-based thought. (Admit it, that’s how most
  people operate.) Instead of “What can this person do for me?”, reverse your
  thinking and ask “**What can I do for this person?**”


  Being likable is not just a ‘nice to have’ trait, it is an approach to your
  life and your business relationships. Practicing the laws will help you create
  meaningful connections that strengthen relationships, improve your
  self-awareness, productivity and ultimately your results.


  Think about where you are in your career and life right now. Which law(s) will
  be most impactful to your relationships? Choose just one and work on
  incorporating it into your interactions with others. Once it becomes something
  you do without thinking about it, choose another one. Apply the laws with
  authenticity and openness and watch how your relationships change. And
  remember, people do business with people they like.

  ### Start by being curious


  > "Curiosity may have killed the cat, but I can tell you it never killed a
  conversation."- The 11 Laws of Likability, page 93


  Each law has valuable lessons. But since I must condense my learnings, I am
  picking just two to summarize. The law of giving, for example, is one which
  can transform your life. Since I have written about the virtues and hazards of
  giving in my summary of [_Give and
  Take_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/give-and-take/), I will focus in
  this summary on the law of curiosity and the law of energy.


  Let’s start with the law of curiosity. Do you ever find yourself in a
  situation where you wonder “What in the world will we talk about?” In general,
  people love to talk. You just need to know how to get them going. Showing
  genuine curiosity about a person’s job, life, interests, opinions, or needs is
  a great way to build a conversation and create connections. It also helps you
  achieve the law of giving. **In order to find ways to help others, you need to
  know more about them and their needs.** Curiosity is your path.


  Another benefit of genuine curiosity is that it brings out the best in us.
  Things like maintaining good eye contact, appropriate head nods, interesting
  follow-up questions are all likable traits that are natural by-products of
  curiosity. **Your curiosity will remove distractions and allow you to focus on
  connecting.** Without even thinking about how to connect, your curiosity will
  do it for you!

> “There is nothing like waking up early in the morning, taking time to enjoy the day before heading off to your chaotic workplace and feel energized throughout the entire day.” _\- The 5 AM Club, page 1_

_The 5am Club_ by Michael Lombardi is a short, simple book about how to take advantage of your most productive time of the day, and how to prepare effectively both mentally and physically, to be ready for whatever the day throws your way.

Starting your day early gives you a leg up on others and gives you time to prepare yourself for your day before you are immersed in it. That quiet time early in the morning is a time to prepare you, body and mind, for a good start. That good start, in turn, gives you the chance to focus on positivity and ensure your day goes the best way possible.

It’s not as easy as setting your alarm for 5am, though. You need to manage your sleep effectively so that getting up so early does not take its toll on you. You need to manage your health, including food and drink intake to keep your body properly fuelled. And in addition, you need to minimize distraction in order to ensure a calm start to your day.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Start Your Day Off on the Right Foot

> "Beginning your day right is indispensable for accomplishing your goals."- The 5 AM Club, page 17

A good, healthy, happy start to your day leads to a good, healthy, happy day. You have within your control the ability to set the tone for your day. You can make it positive or negative, based on how you start.

The snooze bar is your enemy. You have to get up right away if you are going to get up refreshed. The snooze button allows you to drowse in bed, not accomplishing anything more than allowing your body to start into another sleep cycle. Ten minutes later, you are feeling even more tired when the alarm goes off for the second time.

As soon as you get up you have to hydrate your body Give yourself an hour, however, before you eat. Your body slows when it is digesting food and you don’t want to start your day sluggish. Take care of your physical needs right away – ablutions, exercise, whatever you need to get your energy flowing.

Now that you are up and energized, it’s time to work on your goals. Don’t waste time on trivial activities like emails or social media (unless some aspect of it is critical to your goal work – even then, don’t get sucked into trivialities). Prioritize, evaluate and work on achieving your goals. So early in the day, you won’t be distracted by mundane aspects of work and life; you can dedicate yourself completely to the task at hand.

This is also a time for emotional enrichment. Take time to enjoy the fresh morning air, listen to the birds singing, and watch the sun rise. Find enjoyment in nature, it is incredibly refreshing and renewing. Feel the joy of nature.

All of these are suggestions about how to start your day the best way possible. That good start will frame the rest of your day.

### Physical Wellbeing is Key

> "Along with your diet and exercise, you should allocate sufficient time for sound sleep in a day."- The 5 AM Club, page 3

You don’t expect your car to work well if you don’t keep it tuned up. The same applies to your body. Without maintenance and the right fuel, your body will not be able to do what you ask of it. Getting up early will be impossible. Working effectively throughout the day will be very difficult. Getting a good night’s sleep will not happen regularly. Thus begins a downward spiral that ensures it is even harder to keep your body maintained and properly fuelled in the future.

Routine is valuable in keeping maintenance up. Listen to your body, pay attention to when it feels hungry, pay attention to how it acts during and after a meal (can you concentrate while eating? Do you feel sluggish after a meal? How do different foods affect you?). Set up your day to eat at times of maximum hunger and ensure you do not book critical things at times of low energy.

Exercise is valuable to a healthy body. Again, listen to your body and do exercises that are suitable. Do exercises earlier in the day because exercise releases hormones in your body that make you feel energized and alert. If you do this just before bed, sleep will not come easily.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Organization is Important

> "Our minds are freshest when we first wake up. By choosing to get things done at this magic hour in the morning you free yourself from the distractions of cell phones, friends, family, co-workers, and stress."- The 5 AM Club, page 3

You don’t want to waste your most productive time of day on trivial activities that could have been handled when you are not at peak performance. Peak time is for peak performance activities.

So, how do we avoid getting dragged into mundane or stressful tasks when we want to focus on really important work? Eliminate the trivial work by getting it out of the way the night before. Get lunches prepped, get the kids school books organized and waiting by the door, have your own bag ready by the door, ensure keys and other items like glasses, etc. are all stored in the same location every time. Now, your morning won’t be filled with distractions that can waste time and cause you to feel stressed.

Spend time during spare moments to create to-do lists and other memory triggers so that you won’t feel worried about them while trying to sleep or when you are at peak performance. Use those lists to reassure yourself that you don’t need to stress the next morning. You can also use your goal lists in order to be productive during your magic hour in the morning.

_“Begin your day with a smile. Literally. By smiling first thing in the morning it stimulates the brain’s reward mechanisms that are reinforced by a positive feedback loop.”_ (Page 2)

There is time, early each morning, when we can accomplish great things. We can maintain our bodies and souls, we can isolate ourselves from distraction, and we can work on our most important activities; our goals and growth activities. In order to take advantage of this hour of power, we need to remove distractions, ensure we provide our bodies the right food and drink at the right time, and we get sufficient sleep to ensure our bodies will operate at peak performance.
