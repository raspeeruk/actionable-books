  ### Are you Above the Line or Below the Line?


  > "We suggest that the first mark of conscious leaders is self-awareness and
  the ability to tell themselves the truth. It matters far more that leaders can
  accurately determine whether they are above or below the line in any moment
  than where they actually are."- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership,
  location 239


  The model at the core of this book is exceptionally simple. It’s a horizontal
  line. At any given moment, we are either above or below that line. When we are
  below the line, we are in a defensive and closed posture, committed to being
  right. We are in a “to me” state—the world acts upon us. When we are above the
  line, we are curious, wanting to learn. Below the line everything is very
  serious; above the line, there is humor. When we are above the line, we’re in
  a “by me” state—we are authoring our lives.


  The first step in becoming a conscious leader is learning to locate yourself
  either above or below the line. All 15 commitments introduced in this book
  have two versions—one that operates from above the line (e.g., taking full
  responsibility) and another that operates from the below line (e.g., looking
  to place blame.)


  If we are not conscious—not aware—we will gravitate below the line and not
  even notice that most of our time is spent there. We’ll wonder why we aren’t
  getting the results we want. Conscious leaders go below the line all the time.
  They also quickly notice it, accept where they are, and learn to shift to
  being above the line.


  The first step in becoming a conscious leader is to get familiar with what
  each location feels like. Noticing and naming your feelings, your thoughts,
  your beliefs and your motivations are among the practices that you’ll learn.
  With even this introduction, you can already begin. Where are you?

  ### Speak Unarguably—Listen with Curiosity


  > "Great leaders and teams become experts at revealing their unarguable
  experience (‘I’m having a thought…’) without forming any attachment to being
  right about it… When this candor is met with curiosity and deep listening
  ‘Tell me more about that thought. I’m curious to know what you think,’ amazing
  breakthroughs of insight and innovation often occur."- The 15 Commitments of
  Conscious Leadership, location 1360


  Candor is a key to conscious leadership and living above the line. Withholding
  keeps us below the line. However, conscious leaders do more than simply reveal
  rather than withhold. They speak unarguably. Sentences that begin with “I’m
  having the thought that…” or “I feel…” or “I am sensing…” are, by definition,
  inarguable. In other words: “that the thought occurred is unarguable. That the
  thought is true or right is highly arguable.”


  As we learn to speak what is true for us, recognizing that it is not
  necessarily right, and as we learn to listen to others, knowing that they are
  speaking their truths (and that we can be curious about those truths) we can
  extract ourselves from a pattern that we are often stuck in—the drama
  triangle. When we are convinced of our “rightness” we will typically find
  ourselves oscillating among the roles of hero, victim or villain. For an
  introduction to the triangle—and its conscious alternative—here’s another
  great little [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovrVv_RlCMw) from the
  Conscious Leadership Group.

  ### Learning to Shift


  > "Leaders are always drifting and shifting. Shifting is the master skill of
  all conscious leaders."- The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, location
  817


  While shifting is the master skill, it’s not really all that hard. Once we
  recognize that we’re below the line, genuinely accept it, and are willing to
  shift, the most powerful thing we can do is make a physical shift—change our
  body chemistry.


  How do we do that? The authors provide two simple techniques.


  **Technique #1: Conscious Breathing**In a threatened state, we tend to hold
  our breath or breathe shallowly. Conscious breaths break the hold of that
  reactive state. The method offered up here is simple:


  “Four conscious breaths with a four second inhale and a four second exhale
  deep into our belly literally shift our blood chemistry and breathing
  pattern.”


  **Technique #2: Shifting Posture  

  **When we’re in a defensive state and committed to being right more than to
  learning, our body assumes a specific pose. While we may not be aware of this
  at first, it’s actually not hard to identify a defensive posture. Try it now!
  Then, just shifting your posture can help you to shift your state. This can
  mean stepping away, walking for a minute or two, just shifting back if you’re
  leaning in (if you can’t actually get up and move around.) Try it, it’s kind
  of amazing!


  The bottom line: Shifting perspective is much, much easier after you’ve
  shifted your physical state.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s challenging to summarize a book that offers as much as this one. I hope
  that you explore both the book and the videos, and that you find it as useful
  and meaningful as I have. While being a conscious leader and human being may
  not be easy, it’s also not that hard if we practice. Using this book as a
  practice manual is a great way to start!
f_quote-2: >-
  "Commitment is a statement of what is. From our perspective, you can know your
  commitments by your results, not by what you say your commitments are. We are
  all committed. Conscious leaders own their commitments by owning their
  results."

> “You can understand anything better than you currently do. Setting a higher standard for yourself for what you mean by understanding can revolutionize how you perceive the world” _\- The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, page 15_

The origin of all our actions is based on our thinking. So it goes without saying that to improve our lives, whether in relationships, careers, or as students, better thinking will bring better results. Thinking is the root for all successful actions.

Burger and Starbird are award-winning professors who have written numerous books as well as develop consulting practices to teach their advice provided in the book. In 2006, Burger was selected as America’s Best Math Teacher by Reader’s Digest. Starbird conducts workshops nationwide on effective thinking. Their latest book, _The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking_, provides specific action steps anyone can do to improve their thinking. Effective thinking begins with deep understanding.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Understand Deeply

> "Being honest and accurate about what you actually know and don’t know forces you to identify and fill gaps in your understanding."- The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, page 35

Mastering the basics of a topic is the key to understanding something deeply. Do you know the basics of the subject you’re trying to master? Can you write a detailed description of the foundations of a topic from the top of your head? The authors posit that many professionals who have reached the top of their field are true masters of the fundamentals in their particular area of specialty. As Burger and Starbird proclaim “Rock solid understanding is the foundation for success.”

Burger and Starbird believe that you can improve the basics by listing the specific components of the skill or subject you’re trying to learn and spending some time improving your mastery of one of the items. Identifying gaps in your knowledge can also increase your awareness and improve understanding. Being honest about what you don’t know can lead you to act on closing the knowledge gap.

A useful strategy recommended by Burger and Starbird is to understand a small piece of a problem or issue. Understanding the sub-issue deeply can help solve the bigger problem. When faced with a problem, focus on something you know and can solve.

The authors also believe that knowing the sources of your opinions on a topic are instrumental to enhancing your comprehension. Ask yourself, “How do I know?” What evidence is your opinion based on? Don’t take things for granted. Look deep inside and find the source of your opinion or belief and question its authenticity and validity.

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### To Improve Your Odds of Success, Fail

> "Understanding what doesn’t work and why is valuable knowledge."- The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, page 62

Although it sounds counterintuitive, research and history suggests that failure is a valuable stepping stone to success. The authors provide many examples of successful individuals who’ve failed many times before achieving success. Asking ourselves, “Why something is wrong” can pinpoint gaps in the solution. It is not the errors themselves that prove beneficial but the process of correcting mistakes that improve the odds of finding a solution.

When writing out a solution, the authors encourage us to focus on two factors; what’s right and what’s wrong. They provide an example of a math student in one of their classes and how they guide her from her wrong answers to the correct ones. They describe the process as making an attempt at a solution, finding the flaw, fixing it and starting the process over again. As the authors note, “Mistakes present a great opportunity to learn and improve, but action is required. “Once you’ve learned from your mistakes, it’s time to start asking better questions.

### Insight #2

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Question Everything

> "The right questions clarify your understanding and focus your attention on features that matter."- The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking, page 88

Asking good questions can lead to deeper understanding by exposing gaps in our knowledge and can focus our attention on the right issues. The authors believe that questions help you “explore the limits of your understanding” and help to clarify what needs to be done, which increases effective action.

One way to use questioning as an aid to understanding is to teach the topic (the authors refer to it as “teach to learn”). You don’t have to physically teach the material but prepare for it as if you were teaching it. Teaching a subject makes you focus on what the key concepts are and highlights the knowledge gaps and what you need to work on. It also compels you to come up with questions and examples.

They also suggest that we look for ways to improve the question. Asking the right questions helps you focus on the correct issues, which can help reveal hidden assumptions and expose weaknesses. They provide an example of a student trying to improve their grades and the importance of asking the relative question. Rather than asking “How to get better grades,” the correct question should be “How can I learn to think better and understand more deeply?”

Asking questions before an assignment or project can also enhance understanding. This is helpful because it focuses your attention on the core issues. Keep asking yourself “What is the goal of this task” or “What is the benefit?”

Following the advice in this valuable book will improve your thinking. The skill sets and exercises highlighted by the authors form the foundation to master anything anyone wants to learn and should be taught to all students in school.
