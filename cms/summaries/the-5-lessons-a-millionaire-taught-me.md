  ### Age diversity is a good thing


  > "Employers who adapt the fastest to a multigenerational workforce will be
  able to attract the highest-quality employees when the war for talent is in
  full swing."- The 2020 Workplace, page 44


  So here’s the thing. The generation balance in your company is changing right
  now. That means you need to explore the challenges of having an age-diverse
  workforce coexisting in the workplace. You need to consider the best way to
  develop company-wide support for the different communication styles, career
  aspirations and collective knowledge sharing benefits that a diverse workplace
  will bring.


  According to the authors’ extensive research, innovative companies
  successfully working towards an environment focused on talent management are
  offering new future employees of all ages and backgrounds (Generation 2020), a
  deeply personalised and engaging work experience, putting their business at a
  distinct advantage in the new world of work headed our way.


  Here’s a snapshot of the five generations that Meister and Willyerd believe
  will be actively collaborating in our 2020 workplace.


  1.  **Traditionalists**: Fiercely loyal workers born before 1946 who defined
  innovation by the arrival of the fax machine.

  2.  Born between 1946 and 1964, the **Baby Boomers** are influenced by events
  like Woodstock and the JFK assassination, while the personal computer was a
  key technological moment for them.

  3.  **Generation X**, the self-reliant group representing 1965-1976, were
  exposed to MTV, the AIDS epidemic and the invention of the mobile phone.

  4.  **Millennials**: hard-wired into technology since birth (1977-1997), their
  digital skills are inherent.

  5.  **Generation 2020** are approximately 15 years of age today and have grown
  up in a hyper connected world.


  Consider your workplace diversity. What do your co-workers care most about at
  work? Findings from the _The 2020 Workplace_ reveal that members of all these
  generations have three distinct, common needs. They want to feel valued,
  empowered and engaged at work. They need their business leaders to feel
  confident in their ability and effectiveness in their designated roles and job
  functions.


  Getting your company’s multi-generational workplace transformation underway
  begins with understanding the ten forces shaping the future workplace today.
  These include:


  *   Shifting workplace demographics

  *   The knowledge economy

  *   Globalisation

  *   The digital workplace

  *   The ubiquity of mobile technology

  *   A culture of connectivity

  *   The participation society

  *   Social learning

  *   Corporate social responsibility

  *   Millennials in the workplace


  Diversity is a great thing. Businesses who can make it a priority to
  appreciate the individual characteristics of each generation and find a way to
  successfully communicate with different employees will be having a positive
  impact on future employer-employee relationships.

  ### Be socially responsible


  > "The quickest way to kill your brand is to communicate externally something
  that does not resonate internally…"- The 2020 Workplace, page 84


  Just as social interaction is driving learning, corporate philanthropy is now
  business-driven and integrated into the social, ethical and environmental
  agendas of many companies. This is known as corporate social responsibility
  (CSR).


  Commitment to CSR was one of the top ten factors that influenced all
  generations’ choice about a potential employer according to the Future
  Workplace “_The Generations @Work_” survey.


  To build your reputation as a brand whom future employees will feel certain
  prioritises being socially responsible, start by selecting a specific social
  issue (if you don’t already have one) and then highlight your company’s
  ongoing obligation to CSR as part of your core business strategy, not just a
  gimmick. Be clear on what your CSR is, define how success and effectiveness is
  measured and be inspiring in the way you communicate your commitment.


  As an alternative CSR approach, create a policy that allows employees a set
  amount of days in personal time each year to volunteer with an organisation of
  their choice. This option will encourage people and teams to share how they
  are giving back to the community, visibly positioning your brand’s reputation
  as being invested in not-for-profit programs.


  In the workplace of 2020, an increased focus on people, planet and profits,
  also known as the _triple bottom line_, will become a key element for
  businesses to appeal to and keep hold of new hires.

  ### Build (and share) a social media strategy


  > "Creating an environment that is collaborative, authentic, personalised,
  innovative and social, requires leaders whose management behaviours create and
  reinforce that environment."- The 2020 Workplace, page 187


  It’s incredible to think that there are still companies around the globe
  restricting their employees’ access to social network sites. The authors
  reason that businesses who continue to enforce complete lockdowns will
  definitely impact profitable recruitment of top talent, while forward-thinking
  companies will “attract new employees, develop new skillsets, support team
  knowledge sharing, drive collaboration and improve innovation” by leveraging
  the power of social media.


  Why do you need a social media strategy for future success? Simple. At the
  time of publication, two-thirds of the total global internet population were
  members of a social network. In fact, a 2009 Nielson Online report in the book
  reveals that web-based communities and blog content is now more popular than
  email as a form of communication.


  _Uber-connecting_ your organisation is a fantastic concept. The foundation for
  successfully connecting your employees is ensuring you have a sound strategy
  in place and you can get started today by using Future Workplace’s easy 7-step
  framework:


  1.  **Strategy** > Identify business drivers

  2.  **Alignment** > Form a coalition of stakeholders

  3.  **Choices** > Host a social media boot camp

  4.  **Implement** > Create a launch plan

  5.  **Fast Start** > Develop a pilot offering

  6.  **Communicate** > Design a communication plan

  7.  **Measurement** > Agree on metrics


  Without doubt, identifying what your company wants to achieve (step 1) by
  starting on this journey, will be the single most important step of your
  social media strategy. _Uber-connection_ will absolutely change the way work
  is done within your business. You will be offering your team the opportunity
  to be social via an interactive, real-time, engaging environment.


  We know that Gen Xers and Millennials bring digital expectations to the
  workplace. So it makes complete sense, heading towards 2020, for you to
  introduce and drive social technologies in your workplace that encourage
  employees of all ages and qualifications to have conversations with each
  other, share ideas and experience, brainstorm new products and services, and
  proactively contribute to business proposals and initiatives driving business
  growth.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The 2020 Workplace_ was published in 2010, and you will notice that some of
  the USA-centric reference points and “trend” mentions are outdated largely due
  to our technological, hyper-connected world that is moving so fast. However,
  the authors’ acknowledgement that “there’s little that can be said with
  certainty about the future except this: sometime over the next decade your
  company will be challenged in a way for which it has no precedent” rings true
  as we head towards 2020, a mere four years away. Is your business ready?
f_quote-2: >-
  "The 2020 workplace will be fluid, diverse in age and ethnicity, flexible,
  collaborative, mobile, global, and above all, hyperconnected. Get ready to
  live it."

_The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me_, is arguably one of the simplest, cleanest and most inspiring explanations out there when it comes to taking the mysticism out of wealth building.

Writing from experience, Richard Paul Evans teaches five basic principles that virtually guarantee your life long financial wellbeing. As he systematically shows, wealth does not come from inheritance (less than 2%), intelligence, traditional education or even luck (80% of all lottery winners are bankrupt within 5 years). Most wealth, particularly lasting wealth, in North America comes from five basic principles, lived well.

Lesson One: Decide to be Wealthy

Lesson Two: Take Responsibility for Your Money

Lesson Three: Keep a Portion of Everything You Earn

Lesson Four: Win in the Margins

**Lesson Five:** Give Back

_The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me_ is one big lesson in taking ownership of your financial wellbeing. It’s about not being a victim to circumstance, or “wishing” that you could be wealthy. You can, and should, control your own financial destiny.

_“Unfortunately, most people’s closets are more organized than their finances. If you’re one of the fiscally irresponsible, it’s time for change.”_

_The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me_, page 23

### The Big Idea

Brush your teeth daily
----------------------

_“It doesn’t take much. It does take a little bit, regularly.”_

The above quote could apply to pretty much any area of your life in which you want to create a healthy lifestyle. If you want to lose weight, you don’t need to crash diet and hit the gym 4 hours a day. What you do need is a little regular exercise and to cut out the extra donut. If you want to be a better artist, you don’t need a week long intensive, you need regular lessons and practice. And, (from personal experience) if you want to read a book a week for a year, all you really need is 30 to 45 minutes a day.

The same is true with building wealth. While winning 40 million in the lottery, or earning a huge bonus at work would be great, you don’t need either of those to become a millionaire. What you do need is a little work in the margins.

“The margins” are the excess – both the extras you consume and the extras you earn. The idea of winning in the margins is about fulfilling your dreams without sacrificing anything of value. Residence, food, entertainment and activities can remain virtually the same, and your current income stills allow for the creation of significant wealth. The power of compound interest is quite amazing. If you click HERE, you’ll see the opportunity of putting away as little as $50/week. Everyone can be a millionaire. All it takes is a little discipline and a little planning. So where does the extra cash each week come from?

### Insight #1

Less is more
------------

_“Psychologically, in spite of all we’ve been told (or sold), more is less and less is more. This is corroborated by a study that showed that 86 percent of Americans felt happier after having voluntarily cut back on consumption.”_

_The Five Lessons a Millionaire Taught Me_, page 60

Evans suggests that upwards of 20% of your take home income evaporates – that it is spent without providing you with any real value. Have you ever tracked your expenditures for a month? A great exercise is to carry around a little notebook with you and jot down every penny you spend in a month. You’d be amazed at how much goes on completely trivial things.

Life is meant to be enjoyed, so by all means enjoy it. Just be aware of where your money is going, and where you might be able to cut back a little. Understand that what you’re cutting out is not the fun money. It’s not your food money. It’s the crap. It’s the money that evaporates otherwise. Creating wealth is simply a matter of being in control.

### Insight #2

A Few Dollars More
------------------

Ever thought about picking up a second job? How about monetizing a hobby you have? Could you charge for an activity you already enjoy?

One woman I know walks her dog twice a day – loves doing it and has been doing it for years. She put up a few posters in the neighborhood and now walks 3 dogs with her own. Her dog has some company and she has an extra $150 a week for something she was doing anyway.

Think about your passions, hobbies and skills. How could you make a little extra money on the side doing what you love to do?

It really is that easy to build financial wealth. The real challenge, I think, is the distractions along the way. Billions of dollars are spent every year trying to convince us that we’d be better off spending our money now – on the latest and the greatest of this or that. I honestly believe that it’s impossible to resist the siren call of the 52” plasma screen, or the jet ski, or even the extra dinner out without a strong, conscious plan in place of what’s really important to you.

Do you know what’s important to you? Is it that new TV, or a trip to Spain? There’s no right answer, only your answer. Visualize what’s important to you – write it down or cut out a picture of it and put it on your wall. Understand that it is within your grasp, but only through dedication and constant monitoring of your expenses.

Whatever your dream is, don’t sell it short for a shiny, second rate substitution. Yours is meant to be a first class life. Make it so.
