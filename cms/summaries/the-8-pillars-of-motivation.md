  ### Basic Laws


  > "There are laws of nature so why shouldn’t there be laws of marketing?"- The
  22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, page xi


  What are the 22 laws?


  1.  **Leadership** – it’s better to be first than it is to be better.

  2.  **The category** – if you can’t be first in the category – set up a new
  category.

  3.  **The mind** – it’s better to be first in the mind than the marketplace.

  4.  **Perception** – people don’t care about your product, they care what it
  does for them.

  5.  **Focus** – own a word in a prospect’s mind.

  6.  **Exclusivity** – companies cannot own the same word in a prospect’s mind.

  7.  **The ladder** – your strategy depends on which run you sit on the ladder.

  8.  **Duality** – every market eventually becomes a two-horse race.

  9.  **The opposite** – if shooting for second place, your strategy is
  determined by the leader – don’t try to be better, be different.

  10.  **Divisions** – over time a category will divide and become two or more
  categories.

  11.  **Perspective** – marketing effects take place over an extended period of
  time.

  12.  **Line extensions** – when you try to be all things to all people, you
  inevitably wind up in trouble.

  13.  **Sacrifice** – you have to give up something in order to get something.

  14.  **Attributes** – for every attribute there is an opposite, effective
  attribute.

  15.  **Candor** – when you admit a negative, the prospect will give you a
  positive.

  16.  **Singularity** – in each situation, only one move will give you the
  result.

  17.  **Unpredictability** – you can’t predict the future.

  18.  **Success** – can lead to arrogance which leads to failure.

  19.  **Failure** – to be expected and accepted.

  20.  **Hype** – situation is often the opposite of the way it appears in the
  press.

  21.  **Acceleration** – successful programs aren’t built on fads. They’re
  built on trends.

  22.  **Resources** – without adequate funding, an idea won’t get off the
  ground.

  ### The Law of Success


  > "Ego is the enemy of successful marketing."- The 22 Immutable Laws of
  Marketing, page 105


  When people become successful, they tend to become less objective. They may
  substitute their own judgement for what the market wants. It reminds me of
  [Jim Collins](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/authors/jim-collins/)’
  famous quote “Good is the enemy of great”. Success often leads to arrogance
  and arrogance to failure.


  I work in the pharmaceutical industry trying to illuminate our path to patient
  centricity. One of the things I do is shift the mindset of sales reps to be
  focused on the patient instead of the prescription. The irony is that they
  will achieve greater sales when they are more patient focused.


  But the old mindset of being script centric was founded in years and years of
  success. Now, while things are changing, the leaders insist people should “go
  back to basics”. They remember when old strategies were successful and they
  can’t take those blinders off to see a new approach is needed.

  ### The Law of Perception


  > "The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion."- The 22
  Immutable Laws of Marketing, page 19


  Do you think that the best product will win? Many marketers, confident in this
  belief, are preoccupied with ‘getting the facts’. They analyze the situation
  to make sure they have the best product, then naively sail into the world with
  confidence.


  It’s all an illusion says Ries and Trout. There are no best products. All that
  exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer
  or prospect. The perception is the only reality.


  Coca-Cola illustrated this for us when they thought best taste would lead to
  best-selling cola. Remember New Coke? It won the taste competition but the
  perception in the consumers’ minds was more important. The one that research
  showed tasted worst, Coca-Cola Classic, continues to outsell all the others.
  Perception is reality.


  The tricky thing about perception is that we all think we are better
  perceivers than others. Only by accepting that you aren’t and studying how
  perceptions are formed and focusing your marketing on those perceptions can
  you overcome your incorrect marketing instincts.
f_conclusion: >-
  From the Law of Leadership to the Law of Resources, these valuable insights
  stand the test of time and offer guidance for anyone smart enough to look. The
  authors warn, however, about the dangers of applying the laws since many of
  them fly in the face of corporate ego, conventional wisdom and the Malcolm
  Baldrige awards. But with patience and courage, the laws will smooth your road
  to successful products.

  "Once you open your mind to the possibility that there are laws of marketing,
  it’s easy to see what they are. In truth, they are obvious."

> "I believe that motivation happens as a result of smart habits and not the other way around. You do not need to first get motivated to start a new habit in your life. The more sensible order is to start a habit so that it acts as a motivation." _\- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 377_

Often we think of motivation as something we need before being able to do anything else, but as Farnoosh Brock explains in _The 8 Pillars of Motivation_, that is not so. However, some things do need to be in place to inspire the motivation to live the best life possible. In aligning ourselves with these eight pillars, we can be capable of living a passionate life. The greatest takeaway from Brock is that if the correct habits are in place, you’ll never lack for motivation. It’s easy to think someday I’ll do such-and-such, but **without key habits in place, you’re likely to continue on the path of least resistance.**

### It's All About the Attitude!

> "The right attitude is the best and most obvious path to success and yet the least chosen one."- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 480

While all of us have our good and bad days, some people choose to see the positive and carry on despite the disappointments they have had. The reality is, there will always be things that don’t go your way—your car breaks down, someone yells at you because they are also having a bad day, you spill coffee down your suit on the way to a meeting, etc. However, we each have the opportunity to react to each of these things positively or negatively. In fact, **Brock encourages us to see something great in even the worst of these circumstances.** Maybe your car breaking down will lead you to meet someone new. Maybe your listening patiently to the person who has had a bad day will cause them to rethink their attitude. **You can’t force others to see the positive, but you can change the way you react to each circumstance, moment-by-moment, day-to-day.**

“The things that go wrong can be the defining moments of your life.”

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### It Takes a Village

> "Engage in the right place and build the relationships and be sure to give, give, give and then give some more."- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 601

Sometimes just having the right support system in place can make all the difference. If you surround yourself with a lot of naysayers who tell you your ideas won’t work, you’ll likely eventually listen. However, if you cultivate relationships with people who encourage you to go for your dreams, you are much more inclined to try. Brock also tells a personal story about her grandmother that shows that just because someone doesn’t understand why you are doing something doesn’t mean that they don’t care about you. Brock was trying to explain her work in social media and blogging to her grandmother, which her grandmother in Iran did not understand, so she told her grandmother that she was happy and her grandmother accepted that answer much easier than trying to grasp what she did for a living.

Brock writes, **“Often it is not that the people who do not support you don’t want you to be happy; they simply do not understand what it is you are trying to do.”**

So find people who care about you and what you are doing and, at the same time, encourage others in what they are doing—even if you do not fully understand why they want what they want.

### Insight #2

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Have Faith

> "Whatever it is you dream, simply believe that it is entirely possible. If you cannot believe that it is possible every day of the week, then believe that it’s possible on every Tuesday or every Friday."- The 8 Pillars of Motivation, page 621

I love this idea that even if it’s difficult for you to believe that something is possible all of the time, then to at least try and believe it’s possible as often as you can. There are times when I don’t let myself believe my dreams could come true, but this makes it much more doable. Once you believe that things are a possibility, you’re much more likely to put steps in place to accomplish them. For instance, maybe you don’t believe you could run a successful business, but maybe once a week, you set up an event on your calendar to work on that goal. During that time put aside your thoughts – that you don’t think it is a possibility – and act as though it is. Maybe you’ll surprise yourself by making it a reality with just an hour of focus a week or maybe, with time, you can increase that hour of belief into an entire day.

Put the eight pillars to use in your life, and you’ll be well on your way to never losing motivation again. From defining your purpose and direction to cultivating smart habits, you’ll be paving the road to your dreams coming true.  
What habits can you put in place tomorrow that will give you the motivation to accomplish your dreams ten, twenty, or thirty years down the road?
