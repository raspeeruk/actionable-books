  ### Newsflash: You're a Creative


  > "In some circles, the word ‘creative’ has recently morphed from adjective to
  noun. If you are one of the millions among us who make a living with your
  mind, you could be tagged a ‘creative.’ Every day, you solve problems,
  innovate, develop systems, design things, write, think, and strategize. You
  are responsible for… creating value that didn’t exist before you arrived on
  the scene."- The Accidental Creative, page 1


  I fear that many won’t read this summary, and even worse, the book on which it
  is based, because of our existing conception of who is creative. Creatives
  aren’t limited to painters, writers, graphic designers, architects, etc. While
  Henry defines these jobs as **traditional creatives,** any other job where
  you’re expected to create-on-demand (come up with great ideas on short
  notice), but do not fit into the traditional mould, is a **nontraditional
  creative**. These jobs can include (but are not limited to) managers,
  strategists, consultants, salespeople, and client service reps. One the
  surface it might seem as though traditional and nontraditional creatives don’t
  share much in common. When we think of traditional creatives, such as writers
  or painters, we think of individuals toiling away in solitary isolation,
  trying to create their art. But in reality, traditional and nontraditional
  creatives are more alike than they are different. “Astonishingly,” writes
  Henry, “I’ve found little difference among the pressures experienced by these
  diverse groups of people. They each use a different set of specific skills in
  their work, of course. While a designer will solve a problem visually, a
  manager may solve it by developing a new process. But they’re both employing
  the same creative tools and wrestling with many of the same obstacles.”


  Now that you’ve realized that you are indeed a creative, the following
  Insights will be beneficial to you regardless of whether your occupation
  defines you as a traditional or nontraditional creative. If you’re the former,
  the Insights will help you to make the most of your time for maximum
  creativity. The latter group (aka, most of us) will be able to unleash the
  creative potential you didn’t realize was lurking inside you.

  ### Study the Supertexts


  > "I’ve… found that reading great works not only stretches my creative
  expression but also helps me identify patterns in human behavior that haven’t
  changed much over time."- The Accidental Creative, page 145


  This was my favourite practice in the entire book. Whether it’s the works of
  Shakespeare or Plato’s _Republic_, it’s important to read the canonical works
  of literature, plays, spiritual texts (such as the Bible or Quran—in fact many
  of the great Western books contain allusions to the Bible, including John
  Steinbeck’s _East of Eden_). I myself try to read these great “supertexts” in
  order to improve as a writer. (My Amazon “to read” book list is now swelling
  with over 800 titles, and I look forward to reading them over my lifetime…I’m
  realistic enough to know it’s not going to happen overnight!) While this may
  seem like a practice more suited to the traditional creative, it can benefit
  both traditional and nontraditional creatives. Henry writes, “In many ways
  it’s like communing with the great minds of history and allowing them to
  illuminate your understanding of how the world works. This improved
  understanding increases your platform for expression and creative problem
  solving.” These books demonstrate that human behaviour is essentially
  standard, more or less, and remarkably unchanging over time. The philosophies
  in these books are the basis of many of the books we read today, so instead of
  reading distilled versions, why not read the originals?


  To go a step further, you can create a **Stimulus Queue** of the “supertexts”
  you want to read. But most of all it’s important to set aside some time,
  perhaps an hour a day in the evenings (any time that is most convenient to
  you), to study these texts, or study anything that will continue your
  learning. Just because you’re done school doesn’t mean you’re done learning.
  When you stop exposing yourself to new ideas, you become stagnant and so does
  your creativity. You can’t allow that to happen. Stay curious!

  ### Avoid the Ping


  > "You don’t need to get rid of technology; you just need to use it in a way
  that increases your capacity to do what matters to you. You need to set
  priorities and home in on them rather than living in a state of continuous
  partial attention. You can’t do your best and most insightful work when you
  allow the Ping to rule your life."- The Accidental Creative, page 75


  We all do it. You’re hard at work, but suddenly, for whatever reason (and it
  doesn’t even have to be boredom), we check our e-mails or Facebook, and our
  work is disrupted. I’m guilty of this. I even experienced it completing this
  summary. Referring to my Kindle highlights on Amazon necessary to write this
  summary, the lure of Facebook proved too difficult to resist, especially when
  I saw the blinking number in brackets in the tab I had opened notifying me of
  a new message. (Okay, it wasn’t blinking, but it _felt_ like it was!) You get
  the idea, and can probably relate. This lure is what Todd Henry has termed the
  “Ping”, and it’s a big threat to our daily work. It seems like these little
  interruptions aren’t major time wasters, but they are. If you need proof of
  just how much of a time waster it is, this calculation is quite sobering: “if
  on average we work an 8-hour day, 50 weeks per year, and check our e-mail
  every 5 minutes—just to see if anything is there—we check our e-mail 24,000
  times per year”. That amounts to 66.6 hours per year of just checking your
  e-mail and doesn’t actually include the time it takes to answer the e-mails,
  and is low-balling the amount of time it takes to recover your focus after the
  interruption (Henry factored in 10 seconds, when it’s arguably anywhere
  between 30 seconds to 3 minutes!)


  There are some easy ways to avoid the Ping, and it starts with giving some
  consideration to where in your life you Ping the most. If it’s e-mails,
  perhaps designate certain times to check them, like the beginning of each
  hour. Or maybe one day a week leave your Blackberry at home. Whatever it is
  you decide to do to avoid the Ping, the fewer interruptions will allow your
  creativity to flow rather than be constantly interrupted.
f_conclusion: >-
  Todd Henry’s _The Accidental Creative: How to Be Brilliant at a Moment’s
  Notice_ is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Whether we realize
  it or not, we’re all expected to create and add value every day in our jobs.
  If we can’t do that, we will be replaced by someone who can. It’s as simple as
  that. If you work hard to implement some of the practices in this book, there
  is little fear of that ever happening.

Todd Henry is the self-professed “arms dealer for the creative revolution”. Author of _The Accidental Creative: How to Be Brilliant at Moment’s Notice_ and founder and CEO of Accidental Creative (a company that helps its clients achieve many of the same goals that this book promises), Henry reminds us that we are living in a create-on-demand world, where we are forced to be creative and come up with knock-your-socks-off-amazing work at a moment’s notice (as the book’s tagline says). And if we can’t follow through, we will likely be replaced by someone who can. This well written, comprehensive book offers practices to help stoke the fires of your creativity, but wisely does not promise any quick fixes. Rather “\[y\]ou will unleash your latent creative ability through regular, purposeful practice of the principles in this book,” writes Henry. “There are most certainly insights and ‘aha!’ moments to be found in these pages, but knowledge alone won’t do the job any more than knowing the fundamentals of how to exercise will keep you physically healthy. You must be purposeful and intentional. The results are worth it.”

Indeed they are.
