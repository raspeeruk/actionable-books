  ### Design Thinking


  > "Design thinking is a set of general practices a group of us has developed
  over the years that are effective in solving design challenges. A design
  challenge can apply to just about any kind of product or experience. It’s not
  just about how to build a better mousetrap (though that’s part of it); it’s
  also about things that are not physical objects: how to improve the wait time
  at a popular amusement park, how to clean up a highway, how to more
  efficiently get food to needy people, how to improve online dating and so
  on."- The Achievement Habit, page 11


  Design thinking is a different way of thinking about problems than is
  traditionally taught. Roth notes that design thinking has “empathy” at its
  core because design has to be focused on who or what you are designing for
  rather than yourself.


  Beyond empathy is the idea of defining the problem specifically and checking
  to make sure the “problem” is really the issue that needs to be solved rather
  than a symptom of a different problem. Once the problem has been correctly
  defined, a design thinker generates as many solutions as possible and tests
  the best ideas on real people, while collecting feedback. With that feedback
  they can then generate more ideas and repeat the process until they are
  satisfied with the solution.


  It may be most helpful to contrast design thinking with what often happens in
  organizations:


  1.  A problem is identified and given to a group of senior managers to develop
  a solution.

  2.  The group immediately goes about “solving” the problem without talking to
  anyone else.

  3.  The first reasonable idea from the most senior manager is agreed to and
  then a lot of time and effort is spent to implement the idea across the
  organization.

  4.  Finally, when the “solution” fails to solve the initial problem, everyone
  decides the issue is intractable and the organization will just need to “live
  with it.”


  Design thinking helps to avoid these pitfalls and many more in our personal
  life and the organizations we work in.

  ### A Bias Toward Action


  > "The best way forward is embedded in the design thinking methodology:
  manifest a bias toward action and don’t be afraid of failure."- The
  Achievement Habit, page 53


  We are all faced with countless options each day and throughout our lives. It
  is impossible to know what the outcome of those decisions will be so, in most
  cases, the worst thing to do is wait to decide. Roth believes “it serves
  people best in life to accept that decisions are part of the process of moving
  forward, and that there are so many variables that it’s a waste of time to try
  to see the endgame. Once we realize that most decisions are not life-or-death,
  we can make them without undue stress.”


  If you have a big life decision you’ve been putting off you can just ask
  yourself what’s the best choice I can make with the information I have and
  then… act.

  ### A Gooood Reason


  > "When we stop using reasons to justify ourselves, we increase our chances of
  changing our behavior, gaining a realistic self-image, and living a more
  satisfying and productive life."- The Achievement Habit, page 42


  Roth notes that we often justify our behavior with “reasons” that, for the
  most part, don’t actually explain our behavior. A common example would be that
  we are “too busy” for something, when the truth is we simply don’t want to
  make that thing a priority. Stopping ourselves from simplifying our thoughts
  to a few trite reasons opens the door to better understanding the true limits
  we face.


  Roth encourages us to catch ourselves when we are providing reasons
  (especially reasons to ourselves) and imagine a chorus of people sarcastically
  announcing “that’s a _gooood_ reason.” In fact, Roth has his workshops and
  classes do exactly this whenever someone provides a “reason” something can’t
  be done.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Achievement Habit_ provides far more insight than this summary can offer
  because it covers so much ground. The book’s thesis might be something along
  the lines of _how to use design thinking to improve your life_ but the
  nebulousness of that idea demands more thought than even this book can
  provide. If you’re looking to challenge some of your existing assumptions
  about the world then this book is certainly a good read. On the other hand, if
  you want a simple framework for achievement then this book is likely to leave
  you with more questions than answers. Perhaps that’s how it should be.

> "Achievement can be learned. It is a muscle, and once you learn to flex it, there’s no end to what you can accomplish in life." _\- The Achievement Habit, page 5_

Bernard Roth’s _The Achievement Habit: Stop Wishing, Start Doing and Take Command of Your Life_ shows the reader ways they can improve their thinking and the world around them so their goals are achievable. The title of the book may give the impression that it is a step by step primer of some kind which isn’t really the case. Rather, Roth provides a smorgasbord of ideas that all relate generally to the idea of “achievement” in the broadest sense. The book touches on everything from spirituality to engineering so expect to absorb a lot as you read across many disciplines.
