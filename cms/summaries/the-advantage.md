  ### The Business IQ Multiplier


  > "...a good way to look at organizational health - and one that executives
  seem to respond to most readily - is to see it as the multiplier of
  intelligence. The healthier an organization is, the more of its intelligence
  it is able to tap into and utilize."- The Advantage, page 22


  As Lencioni says, most business leaders will look at the list of factors for
  healthy companies (above) and agree that they are important and that having
  them in place in their organization would positively impact bottom line. And
  yet, shockingly few companies actually work to improve these areas, instead
  choosing to spend their time focused on the less-messy and, frankly, safer
  areas of Strategy, Marketing, Finance and Technology. In most cases, this is
  due mainly to the fact that the “softer” health related factors (minimizing
  politics, improving morale, etc) are more ambiguous and messy; they require
  more thought, reflection and effort – three things that most busy executives
  are short on. So, understanding the importance of Organizational Health, but
  knowing how busy we are as leaders, where do we start?


  In addition to being an enjoyable read, full of anecdotes and real world
  examples, _The Advantage_ provides leaders with a road map to Organizational
  Health; four disciplines that management teams can focus on to improve the
  health of their own companies.


  **The Four Disciplines**


  Discipline 1: Build a Cohesive Leadership Team  

  Discipline 2: Create Clarity  

  Discipline 3: Over-communicate Clarity  

  Discipline 4: Reinforce Clarity


  Though the list looks deceptively simple, the creation and reinforcement of
  each discipline is as complex as the humans involved. Because, after all, what
  we’re talking about here is the people side of the business.


  Each discipline is explored in great detail in _The Advantage_, complete with
  specific exercises that you can use to strengthen the discipline with your own
  team. While each discipline builds upon the last (meaning that you can’t
  effectively _Over-communicate Clarity_ without first _Building a Cohesive
  Leadership Team_), in this article we’re going to explore **Discipline 2:
  Creating Clarity**, so you can get a sense of the type of content offered in
  the book. And, ideally, you can start putting something into practice
  immediately.

  ### The Rallying Cry


  > "...if we accomplish only one thing during the next x months, what would it
  be?"- The Advantage, page 143


  Another important aspect of Creating Clarity is clarity around the top
  priority, right now. Notice I say “top priority”, not “top priorities”.
  Obviously, different departments have different goals and benchmarks to
  achieve. We’re not talking about day to day operations here. Instead, we’re
  talking about growth; progress and accomplishment.


  A fantastic unifying experience (that will also positively impact Discipline
  1: Build a Cohesive Leadership Team) is the collective definition of a
  “Rallying Cry”, or what Lencioni defines as a **Thematic Goal**. What is that
  one thing that, as a company, we absolutely must accomplish within the next 6
  months?


  Setting a thematic goal for the company is incredibly powerful on three
  fronts: (a) it provides a crystal clear objective for everyone on the team (b)
  it gives people a sense of purpose in their work, driving productivity and
  workplace enjoyment, and (c) it naturally requires prioritization and focus,
  avoiding unnecessary busy work.


  As Lencioni explains, a thematic goal must be “qualitative, temporary and
  shared by the leadership team”.


  I encourage you to think through your own thematic goal. What’s your top
  priority, as a company? Get together with your leadership team. Discuss. Plan
  and execute.

  ### The Six Questions


  > "Getting caught up in word-smithing is often a sign that a team is missing
  the boat."- The Advantage, page 97


  One of the things I’ve always enjoyed about Lencioni’s books is their
  simplicity.


  Having worked as a consultant to Southwest Airlines, Nestle, Cisco and other
  corporate giants, Lencioni has had direct insight into some of the world’s
  greatest leadership teams. It’s refreshing to realize that the top performing
  leadership teams in the world operate their businesses with a common sense
  approach. This is not to say that what they do is easy or typical (quite the
  opposite, actually), but rather that their practices are ones we can all
  understand.


  When it comes to **Creating Clarity** in our businesses, Lencioni suggests
  that we, as leaders, need to answer six simple yet profound questions:


  1.  Why do we exist?

  2.  How do we behave?

  3.  What do we do?

  4.  How will we succeed?

  5.  What is most important – right now?

  6.  Who must do what?


  Simple questions, but decidedly difficult to answer. As the quote at the
  beginning of this insight suggests, the importance here is on answering the
  questions in plain English; in words that everyone in the company can clearly
  understand. Far too often we get tripped up by our own intelligence; we dilute
  and bog down the answers to these crucial questions with jargon and slick
  marketing copy.


  If the goal here is to “Create Clarity” – both for ourselves and our teams, we
  need to resist the urge to make the answers more complex than they need to be.
  The **language** isn’t important. The answers are.


  Lencioni suggests that answering these six questions should be a collaborative
  activity with the entire leadership team, and will often take a two-day
  offsite (or longer) to solidify. But where do we start?


  **_“So how does an organization go about figuring out why it exists? It starts
  by asking the question, ‘How do we contribute to a better world?'”_**


  Start there. Discuss, as a leadership team, the impact that you’re making on
  the world, and why that gets you out of bed in the morning. If you give
  everyone a chance to answer this question on their own before discussing, you
  may be surprised by the variety of answers.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Advantage_ is a brilliantly written book. Full of enough stories and
  examples to keep it engaging, loaded with enough guides and exercises to make
  it actionable, and littered with Lencioni’s trademark humour, it’s as
  enjoyable a read as it is impactful. It’s also Lencioni’s first departure from
  business fables, which made me a little nervous. After all, Lencioni’s fables
  are some of the best out there. I shouldn’t have worried. The examples and
  stories – which crop up every ten pages or so – provide insightful and often
  hilarious examples to the points he makes. In fact, I think I enjoyed the
  stories in this book **more** than the fables, knowing them to have actually
  happened… proving that the old adage may very well be true, and that truth
  really is stranger than fiction.

> "...any organization that really wants to maximize its success must come to embody two basic qualities: it must be smart, and it must be healthy." _\- The Advantage, page 16_

In his brilliantly structured guidebook, _The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business_, bestselling author and leadership giant Patrick Lencioni categorizes Organizational “Smarts” and “Health” as follows:

**Smart:**

*   Strategy
*   Marketing
*   Finance
*   Technology

**Healthy:**

*   Minimal Politics
*   Minimal Confusion
*   High Morale
*   High Productivity
*   Low Turnover

So here’s my question to you – **where are you (and your leadership peers) spending most of your time and energy?**

In possibly his most content-rich and action focused book to date, Lencioni (author of [_The Five Dysfunctions of a Team_](../summaries/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/)_,_ [_Death by Meeting_](../summaries/death-by-meeting/)) draws on his 20+ years of leadership consulting experience to make a compelling and (for many) counterintuitive point: companies that thrive in the 21st century do so by focusing their efforts on **Organizational Health** over **Organizational Smarts.**
