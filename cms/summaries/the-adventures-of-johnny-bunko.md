  ### Re-examining the Rules


  > "It’s nice to believe that you can map out every step ahead of time and end
  up where you want. But that’s a fantasy. The world changes. Ten years from
  now, your job might be in India. Your industry might not even exist."- The
  Adventures of Johnny Bunko


  The biggest lesson we can pull from _The Adventures of Johnny Bunk_o is that
  it is now impossible to accurately chart your course for the future. If you’d
  taken the time in 1995 to try to predict what the world would look like today,
  I doubt anyone could have accurately predicted even a small percentage of the
  massive changes we would have gone through as a global community. And that’s
  just in the past 15 years. When a new graduate stands on the doorstep of the
  work world, they have, on average, forty years of work ahead of them. None of
  us know what the world will look like in 40 years, and anyone who tries to
  visualize a step-by-step career path for themselves is setting themselves up
  for failure.


  Which is not to say, by any stretch, that we shouldn’t have goals. But the
  goal is more a visualization of where you want to be in 20, 30 or 40 years,
  and the values that you wish to be remembered for… not the exact route to get
  there. In a time of flux, such as we’re in, our values, long term objectives,
  and enjoyment of our current work is more important than ever.

  ### The Right Kind of Mistake


  > "Too many people spend their time avoiding mistakes. They’re so concerned
  about being wrong, about messing up, that they never try anything – which
  means they never do anything."- The Adventures of Johnny Bunko


  So here’s the caveat to insight #1 – If you’re going to throw yourself into
  projects you enjoy – projects that fundamentally motivate you – you’re going
  to make mistakes. It’s impossible to be passionately working at the front of
  the curve and not make mistakes. After all, you’re working in uncharted
  territory. The very nature of globalized talent and the intense competition
  that comes as a result is that the rewards, recognition and “success” in the
  21st century goes not to those who execute flawlessly on something that’s been
  done before, but to those who innovate. And innovation means making mistakes.
  The important differentiator is what kind of mistakes you’re making. Careless
  errors, due to sloppy work or less than 100% commitment to the task will be
  punished swiftly. And rightly so – with 100 competitors lined up behind you,
  why would a company or client continue to rely on your ineptitude? Careless
  mistakes are unacceptable.


  Mistakes born from innovation however are a completely different story.
  Innovation means you’re tackling something new – something fresh. People (and
  companies) seem far more understanding and willing to work with you when you
  fail dramatically during the process of creating. The trick, of course, is to
  pick yourself back up when you make a mistake innovating. The learning
  experience of blazing a new trail is invaluable and unique to those who take
  chances. It’s that experience, over time that will lead to massive
  breakthroughs. As John Maxwell said in his excellent text, Talent is Never
  Enough, “Persistence trumps Talent”. Don’t rely on your degree or IQ score
  alone to carry you through life. You need to be willing to make mistakes.
  Passionately.

  ### Tell me why…


  > "You can do something for instrumental reasons – because you think it’s
  going to lead to something else, regardless of whether you enjoy it or it’s
  worthwhile… or you can do something for fundamental reasons – because you
  think it’s inherently valuable, regardless of what it may or may not lead
  to."- The Adventures of Johnny Bunko


  For many people, a job in the 40s, 50’s and 60s was a means to an end – a way
  to put food on the table, and a roof over their heads. As a society, we had
  many people pursuing jobs for instrumental reasons; that is, working towards a
  fixed retirement date or a proven promotion path. And, while it wasn’t ideal,
  that path was ok. When spending 30 years with one company was the norm, there
  was nothing wrong with planning your life around the stability of your
  relationship with your company. Simply put, it was easier to predict the
  future. But what about in a world where you can’t predict the future? Even
  looking out five years, the future is now laced with uncertainty. I would
  argue that it is important now, more than ever, that we pursue jobs and
  projects for fundamental reasons – for the inherent pleasure and satisfaction
  that we get from the work itself.


  At first blush, I may be accused of being somewhat bohemian in that statement
  – of buying into the Gen-Y mentality of instant gratification. Certainly, work
  you enjoy is more rewarding short term. But, I would also argue, that it is
  work you are more committed to. More passionate about. The kind of work that
  you throw yourself into, and wouldn’t dream of cutting corners with. It’s the
  kind of work where you shine. And, of course, those who shine get noticed.
  Those who shine are asked to be a part of new projects and new, cutting edge
  ventures. Those who shine stay ahead of the curve.


  In a world where the future is unknown, the long term success goes to those
  who are full of purpose, passion and a willingness to tackle the new.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Adventures of Johnny Bunko_ is brilliant. An experiment in its own right,
  this soft cover is a quick read, brilliantly illustrated, and packs a punch.
  As the “career advisor” Diana says near the end of the book, “This isn’t just
  career advice, guys. In some ways, this is what it means to be alive.” Hear,
  hear.

I had a serendipitous encounter last week that, for me, expounded the value of this week’s article content. Wednesday night, I had the pleasure of sitting down for drinks with two new friends, Dan and Amanda. Dan and Amanda are just entering their final year of their respective undergraduate degrees and, like most soon-to-be-graduates, are looking forward to their launch into the “real world” with a healthy balance of excitement and trepidation. It’s a fascinating time of life, when 16 years of educational structure are suddenly replaced by a “fend for yourself and hope for the best” freedom.

Also last week, I enjoyed reading one of the most applicable and “real” career guides ever written; _The Adventures ofJohnny Bunko_. In it, Dan Pink shares some of the new rules and expectations for those new to the work world – the understanding that life is not a linear “graduate with good grades, get a job, get married, get a promotion, have kids, get a promotion, buy a house, get a promotion, buy a sports car, retire” process anymore (if it ever was). The rules have changed. Globalization and the incredible range of options we now enjoy have come with their own set of challenges and learning opportunities; opportunities that are, traditionally, not explored in our traditional education system.

And so, in honor of Dan, Amanda, and the countless others like them, I share with you the key learnings from _The Adventures of Johnny Bunko_. (Which is, incidentally, written as a Japanese-style comic book. As I mentioned, times have changed.)
