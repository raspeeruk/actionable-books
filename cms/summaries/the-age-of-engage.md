  ### Stop Listening To Your Customer and Start Interacting With Them


  > "The Live Web offers small companies an advantage previously only found in
  large companies, the ability to communicate with strangers, customers, and
  partners no matter where they may be located…(it) drives us to reinvent our
  organizational behavior, our product development process and design, our
  partnerships, and of course, our marketing."- The Age of Engage, pages 10-11


  The traditional “Four P’s” of marketing, while important, need to evolve and
  be more inclusive of new evolutionary articulations of the marketplace.
  Shiffman elbows in a new strategy, which is the foundation for the book,
  called “The 6 V’s”. They are:


  **Venture** – the deep integration of product, services and channel
  distribution  

  **Value** – Creating inherent “marketingness”  

  **Voice** – The perception created by vision and story  

  **Verification** – Developing credibility through proof, truth and
  transparency  

  **Vicinity** – Harnessing communities of the Live Web  

  **Vehicle** – Incorporating Web 2.0 (and beyond) strategies


  When a business employs the blueprint of these six tenants, they will be able
  to build more sustaining trust “by reshaping audience interactions”, create
  more impactful persuasive value, extend the influence of your efforts in
  social media and deploy new, more effective marketing tactics.

  ### In An Interactive, Social Marketplace, Voice Has Legs


  > "Voice is a communications platform – a chosen value system, passion, and
  personality…voice is defined through the narrative you create, and that
  narrative encompasses your company style, tone, view of the marketplace,
  vision of the future, and passion."- The Age of Reason, page 87


  Shiffman declares that there are three forms voice: inform, connect, and
  engage. The marketing of a company can utilize any of these – or all three.
  Companies of all sizes tend to get caught up in production cycles, development
  of new products, distribution and financial controls and organizational
  struggles. While discussions of ‘vision’ are commonplace for most businesses,
  time dedicated to viewing a businesses’ efforts having ‘a voice’ lends itself
  to a more reflective, authentic and engaging connection to its audience. The
  connective tissue that a compelling message of purpose and how it has the
  capability to change lives forces the leaders of a business to continually ask
  the question: “What business are we _really_ in?”


  How a business _inform_s their audience is an important frame that brings an
  understanding of the product, the company and its customers. How a business
  chooses to enlighten its customers and market makes a statement that its
  market perceives with importance – don’t take it lightly. To _connect_ in ‘The
  Age of Engage’ is to have an “approachable platform and message” that utilizes
  the power of story that takes the customer on a journey which the audience has
  an important part inside of. When a business effectively _engages,_ the
  audience that interprets the voice of the company senses an openness and
  authentic transparency which compels its people to interact, share and
  encourage the business to do work that they will support, thus (to paraphrase
  Tom Peters) making the efforts of marketing superfluous.

  ### Throw Out Your Marketing Plan and Let Your Marketing Become A Change Agent


  > "It is the marketer’s job to change perspective, change markets, and change
  perceptions…every feature, function, or service is up for grabs and open to
  new ideas or change, so the rules never stay the same. You have to keep
  raising the bar."- The Age of Engage, page 189


  While it’s become cliché when talking about the effects of the internet on
  business changing all the rules (I’ve worked in the music business for the
  last 25 years, trust me, I ‘get it’), it’s a meme that bears a deep
  understanding. Finding ways to continually engage your prospects and existing
  customers in an authentic and interactive manner will give a competitive
  advantage to your business when the strategic leader defies conventional
  wisdom and incorporates meaningful interactions with its customers.


  When a business can effectively understand the needs and wants of their
  customers, it can predict them with a greater frequency of success. Allowing
  “The Live Web” to create an environment inside one’s business makes “the world
  small and enables us to work, think, and act together in real-time.” The
  process of marketing must be done with a living document (and not a static
  ‘marketing plan’) that continually evolves in the course of daily business and
  one which creates a social, honest, open and truly interactive environment in
  which the customer is an active participant.
f_conclusion: >-
  Though the “The Live Web” has clearly created a disintermediating affect in
  almost all industries and much of the material covered in _The Age of Engage_
  is well accepted by smart, sharp strategic communicators, the book pushes
  asides theory and provides a practical plan of action that will help
  medium-to-larger sized companies make sure they are doing the right actions
  and, if they aren’t, engage in a plan of catch-up that will lead them to more
  meaningful and profitable relationships with the people that use their
  products and services.

Written from the platform of a consultant speaking to ‘old world corporations’ still dabbling with the repercussions and reverberating waves of change that the internet has wrought, _The Age of Engage_ by Denise Shiffman exhorts the reader who may be stuck in old paradigms to, essentially, wake up and embrace what she calls ‘The Live Web’, another term for the internet. The application of ‘the live web’ to all industries and any kind of business is a call to engage more purposefully with their customers and build deeper, more meaningful relationships with them. It’s a once in a millenium opportunity for business to minimize risk, bring more value and a stronger voice for all aspects of engagement with your customer.

Postlude: While her book was published in 2008, the web addresses Shiffman had associated with the book (ageofengage.com and marketingreinvented.com) are long defunct with no re-direct–just a dead end. This is not a way to ‘engage’. It’s an odd, sloppy slip-up connected to such a work whose ‘life’ extends on inside ‘the living web’.
