  ### The Shotgun is Broken

  targeted, and know what you're aiming for."- The Anti-Resume Revolution, page

  It used to work. As job seekers, we could print off a hundred copies of our
  resumes and walk door to door, handing them out to all the businesses in our
  neighborhood. When the opportunity to connect between employers and employees
  was limited to these guerrilla tactics or a high priced placement company, you
  actually stood a shot if you simply got in front of enough people. Even in the
  early days of the internet, the digital version of the same approach
  (email-blasting out your resume to every job posting you found) worked for
  some. We called it the “shotgun approach”, and sadly (gladly?) those days are
  over. Employers aren’t limited anymore. Now, a single job posting on
  workopolis.com or monster.ca can now garner several hundred emails in its
  first day. Which means what, exactly, for you?


  If you’re a job seeker (either unemployed or looking for a new opportunity),
  it means you need to understand that your 8.5″ x 11″, Times New Roman font
  resume, chronologically listing all your past work experience is no longer the
  ticket to your dream job (if it ever was). You need to stand out – you need to
  be fresh, different, and exactly what your dream employer is looking for.


  If you’re an employer, it means that a single, bland job posting on one of the
  employment sites could easily drown you in standard, nearly identical resumes
  that will leave you doubtful that you’re making the right hire at all.


  Regardless of which side of the table you’re on, the name of the game is
  quality over quantity. The shotgun is broken. The ease with which people can
  send and receive information has rendered the manila application process
  overwhelming and obsolete. The good news is that you now have choice.
  Glorious, virtually limitless choice. Job seekers have more opportunity than
  ever before, and employers have access to more potential employees – the right
  employees – than they could possibly manage. Which is to say, the opportunity
  to find your dream job (and dream employee) is greater than ever. But it takes
  some planning.

  ### Be tangible


  > "Send an actual card or postcard and really blow them away."- The
  Anti-Resume Revolution, page 116


  We’ve already touched on it – technology allows for the greater flow of
  information. We all know this, inherently. The challenge with information is
  that it lacks soul. Email and social media may be great tools for efficiency,
  but they lack something in personality, “memorabilty” (yes, we coined that
  one) and impact. Nothing replaces real, three dimensional contact in the
  physical world. If you want to be remembered – if you want to stand out – go
  beyond what’s expected. Step outside the digital world. After a meeting, send
  an actual thank you card. Even if samples of your work are available online,
  bring actual samples (printed or three dimensional) with you to an interview.
  Understand what your audience is looking for, then create something –
  something real, and one-of-a-kind – that specifically appeals to their needs
  or desires. Get them (whether “they” are a potential employer or potential
  employee) excited to know you.


  This approach will require some time. It will require some creative effort. It
  will require thought, reflection and planning. But that’s what it takes to
  stand out in the crowd and appeal you to the people and companies you want to
  connect with. It takes work. Whether you feel that work is worth it is
  entirely up to you.

  ### Know Thy Audience


  > "Good communicators get ahead because they understand the importance of
  knowing their audience and use that knowledge to influence others."- The
  Anti-Resume Revolution, page 104


  Who are you trying to talk to? Have you taken a moment to define your ideal
  candidate? Before you look for a new collaborator (company or individual), you
  need to answer four questions:


  1.  Who are you looking for?

  2.  Why are you looking for them, in particular?

  3.  What do you suppose they are looking for?

  4.  Why are they looking for that?


  What may have always been true at a senior management level is now becoming
  applicable to all levels of business – Employment is becoming more of an
  agreement between two equal parties than it is an individual grovelling for a
  job. We all have choices. No employee worth their salt wants to work for a
  boring company, and no driven business wants a “typical” employee. When you
  understand that you are half of a two part equation, you can start to tailor
  your “pitch” (convincing the other party that you’re worth talking to) in a
  meaningful way that appeals to your target market specifically.


  Think about what you really want. Think about who’s offering that. Think about
  what they want. Act accordingly. Don’t waste your time sending out fifty
  generic resumes, when you can have way more impact with five highly targeted
  ones.
f_conclusion: >-
  I liked Lussier’s book. _The Anti-Resume Revolution_ is fresh, fun and written
  with Lussier’s quirky personality front and centre. Most importantly, of
  course, it’s chock full of great ideas on when to bend (and in some cases
  completely destroy) the pre-conceived and highly antiquated beliefs about job
  searching. A must-have for anyone in transition right now, _The Anti-Resume
  Revolution_ is also a great resource for HR professionals, small business
  owners, and anyone else who ever has a hand in the recruiting process.

_The Anti-Resume Revolutio_n, Angela Lussier’s entrance into the literary world, is a wonderful little book that touches on a major shift taking place in the work world today, the gist of which is this:

Few are in it for the long haul anymore; employees are looking for stepping stones, and employers are looking for solutions to today’s challenges.

With rare exception, the 30 year “employee/employer” relationship is a thing of the past. People are looking for “resume builders” more than careers, and companies are responding in kind. Which means that employee turnover is a very real part of our business landscape. And, as if determining ideal “fit” wasn’t hard enough as it was, email and online job postings mean we are virtually inundated with options – both as employees and as employers. Thankfully, some professionals (like Lussier) understand the changing work dynamic, have learned how to best navigate it and are willing to share their knowledge with the rest of us.
