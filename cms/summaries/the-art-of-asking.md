  ### Asking is About Human Connection


  > "Asking is, at its core, a collaboration."- The Art of Asking, page 47


  For some years Palmer worked as a living statue known as The Eight Foot Bride.
  She asked people to support her performance art and in return she would give
  them a flower – a gesture of thanks and a moment of connection. As Palmer
  demonstrates, it is that connection that lends itself to community building
  and collaboration. For example, when her bands have toured she always makes it
  a point to be available to her audience for signings after shows and talks to
  them from the stage during shows. This connection makes asking easier. The
  stakes are lower because we trust that the people we are asking will respond
  compassionately. Asking is an act of exchange, reciprocity, comfort, love and
  vulnerability. When we truly ask, we experience human connection.

  ### Minimal DIY versus Maximal DIY


  > "Limitations can expand, rather than shrink, the creative flow."- The Art of
  Asking, page 101


  Over my years of reading, I’ve read a lot of books on creativity that suggest
  that limitations can be good for creativity. With fewer options, we tend to
  get more creative. Palmer has a different way of thinking about these
  limitations as they relate to asking, which I really appreciated. The first is
  Minimal DIY, which is “the kind of DIY where you literally try to do it
  yourself. The emphasis is on total self-reliance and individualism”. The
  second is Maximal DIY, which is about asking for help and expanding your
  opportunities. “The emphasis is on collectivism; you throw the problem out to
  one of your circles to see what solutions will arise”.


  The point that Palmer is making with this explanation of DIY is that you don’t
  always have to do it yourself. You can ask for help along the way, and
  sometimes if you are trying to do everything yourself having help can get you
  a better outcome. Palmer goes on to point out that Maximal DIY relies on trust
  and ingenuity.

  ### Community is Everything


  > "It was a massive leap of faith for these people to believe that ‘just
  connecting with people,’ in an authentic, non-promotional, non-monetary was,
  is so valuable."- The Art of Asking, page 156


  One of the cornerstones of Palmer’s success is her community. Across all of
  her projects (The Eight-Foot Bride, The Dresden Dolls, and so on), a community
  has been there to support her. Palmer has cultivated this community in the
  simplest ways – connecting and communicating. She’s used her blog, social
  media and signings after shows to talk to fans. Asking people for something is
  also a way that she builds that community. “Back when I only had a few
  thousand followers, I could ask anything, or ask _for_ anything, in 140
  characters at a time. The responses poured in. I answered. I thanked people
  loudly and publicly. Waving my gratitude like a flag is part of what keeps the
  gift in motion.”


  The principles at work in Palmer’s community and her asking are gratitude,
  reciprocity, trust, and relationships. Her ability to ask for anything would
  not be as successful otherwise. In the broader applicability of these
  principles, everyone and every business can and should build a community. I
  think part of the trick is to do it more authentically.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Art of Asking_ is a fascinating read. I appreciated the multi-faceted
  look at community, gratitude and help. Palmer is doing her part to make it
  okay for all of us to ask for anything.

> "You can fix almost anything by authentically communicating." _\- The Art of Asking, page 252_

It’s been a few days since I finished _The Art of Asking_ by Amanda Palmer, and I feel as though I have only begun to experience the immense impact this book will have on my life. Palmer is an artist at her core and in creating art, she has created an incredible community. It is a community who supports her art in so many ways, and they support it because she asks.

_The Art of Asking_ is a seminal life lesson about how it is okay to ask for what you need. Help. Support. Love. A pen. It is all okay to ask for. Palmer teaches this important lesson through numerous stories of her own life experience, including times when she struggled to accept help. Her openness and vulnerability is a humbling reminder that we are all human and that our imperfection is what makes us beautiful.
