  ### Become Unmistakable


  > "What would happen if you actually said what you were thinking – honest,
  imperfect, unedited, and unfiltered?"- The Art of Being Unmistakable, page 17


  When following society’s life plan becomes too painful. When you have nothing
  left to lose and the one thing you want more than anything in the world is to
  just be yourself. When you’re ready to embrace your inner misfit and approach
  your life like a work of art, **you’re ready to become unmistakable.**


  It’s time to stop mimicking your mentors and the “celebrities” in your
  industry. Stop inhaling blogs and clinging to the words of others. Stop
  following formulas for success and please, stop waiting for an invitation to
  the ball. The invite may never arrive, but you can attend regardless.


  Let’s do it. **Let’s become unmistakable.** I’m right here with you. **The
  first step is to give yourself permission to be your no-bullshit self.** Once
  you find your no-bullshit self, life will become more colorful – or so I would
  imagine. (I’m still searching for my no-bullshit self.) You’ll start to choose
  yourself and you’ll stop working for the sake of accolades, invitations, and
  vanity metrics. You’ll create for yourself. You’ll create to help others.
  You’ll create because that’s what you were meant to do.


  So stop with the bullshit already, okay?

  ### Choose yourself


  > "The opportunity to choose you, do something that matters, make dents in the
  universe and leave your soul print in the sand is more accessible than at any
  time in the history of western Civilization."- The Art of Being Unmistakable,
  page 108


  _Have you heard?_ The gatekeepers – you know, the ones that hold the key to
  your imminent future – are going extinct. This is good news for some of you …
  and bad news for others.


  It turns out many of us like the idea of being chosen. I mean, who doesn’t
  want to be labeled as special and singled out from the masses? _I certainly
  do._


  Yet we’re living in a magical time where you don’t have to wait for the Oprah
  of gatekeepers to let you into the party. You can now shimmy past them and
  show up to the fête armed with your talent, a 6-pack of Heineken and your
  no-bullshit charm. **Your inner-creative will shine, brilliantly, for all to
  see.**


  **Choose yourself.** Don’t wait for a fancy _schmancy_ invitation from anyone.
  In other words, stop worshipping heroes and become your own superhero.


  Here are 3 ways you can choose yourself immediately:


  1.  **Learn something that you _actually_ want to learn.** Not something you
  think you should learn. Ask yourself, what am I interested in? And then pursue
  it.

  2.  **Grab a virtual mic** (we all have access to a microphone) and speak your
  truth. When I say mic, this may represent your blog or your YouTube channel or
  if you’re a podcaster, it is literally a microphone at your desk.

  3.  **Share your art** with everyone you stumble across. Don’t be afraid to
  connect with key influencers too and say, _“Here I am and this is what I’ve
  got to say. Take it or leave it.”_

  ### Become the No-Bullshit Version of You


  > "In a world where everybody has a voice, the only ‘personal brand’ that will
  stand out is one that is honest, imperfect, vulnerable, and rough around the
  edges. When you polish anything too much, it loses the thing that makes it
  shine from within."- The Art of Being Unmistakable, page 104


  We’re so accustomed to fitting in and dressing up for a motley of parts in our
  lives – spanning from job performances to cocktail parties – that we actually
  leave our true selves at the door. We drop off our opinions, vulnerabilities,
  and inner misfits at the entrance along with our faux fur coats. Stripping off
  our layers feels safe.


  I hate to tell you this but “fitting in” is _so_ last decade. It’s out, o-u-t,
  OUT and the no-bullshit bandwagon is here to stay. The no-bullshit approach to
  life is one that allows you to take risks, speak your truth and work on
  projects you actually care about. Your no-bullshit self isn’t concerned with
  validation and creates for the love of creating.


  Here are 3 ways you can tap into your no-bullshit self:


  *   **Piss people off** – you may shock ‘em but at least you’re speaking your
  truth.

  *   **Focus on your impact, not your open rate** – metrics feed your ego but
  force you to follow a formula to online success. Avoid formulas.

  *   **Stop saying what people want to hear** – You’re probably wrong anyway.


  If you feel uncomfortable, you’re most likely on the right track. If
  colleagues start looking at you like, _I can’t believe you just said that_,
  you’re making progress.


  Remember, be YOU. Don’t settle for a “pale comparison of someone else.”
f_conclusion: >-
  As the online world rapidly expands, it is almost too easy to fall into the
  trap of following someone else’s formula for success in business and life in
  general. After all, there are webinars and e-courses for just about
  everything.

What happens when you decide to speak your truth and you post your story –vulnerabilities and all – into your Facebook feed?

**People listen.** It turns out when Srinivas Rao started posting his story, a lot of people listened. His collection of raw essays turned into _The Art of Being Unmistakable_, a forthright and worthy read for all creatives.

Srini Rao not only writes in a no-bullshit sort of way, he lives it too. He is the unofficial leader of the no-bullshit movement and the co-founder and host of the [The Unmistakable Creative Podcast](http://unmistakablecreative.com/), one of the best podcasts out there for creative people just like you.

Knowledge is a wonderful and powerful thing but mimicking others can be toxic. Forging your own path and creating your own art is a worthy challenge we can all approach with humility. Let’s commit to learning from each other without copying each other.

I’ll leave you with this question: **_What would your life look like if you lived every single day as your no-bullshit self?_**
