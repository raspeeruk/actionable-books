  ### The Tipping Point of Choice


  > "Even though the latter attracted more attention, more than six times as
  many people made a purchase when we displayed the smaller set of jams."- The
  Art of Choosing, page 187


  So, this behavioural psychologist sets up a study where we (consumers) are
  presented with 6 options and given an incentive($1 off coupon) to make a
  decision (purchase a jar of jam). Then, another batch of consumers is
  presented with 30 options and given the same incentive to make a decision.
  More options, more chance of making a decision, right? More chance of finding
  the exact jam that matches our unique needs and therefore making us happier,
  right? Wrong.


  As it turns out, those consumers that were presented with fewer options were
  **_six times more likely to make a decision as to which jam they’d be happy
  purchasing._** So what’s going on here?


  In _The Art of Choosing_, Iyengar explores dozens of research projects (many
  of which, including the infamous “Jam Study”, she was instrumental in
  orchestrating) that examine the choosing process that we are all subjected to
  in our daily lives. And the fascinating result is this: while we all enjoy the
  process of selection – of being able to express our uniqueness and to exercise
  our independent thought – there are other factors at play that can turn the
  choosing process into a stressful experience, factors that can actually
  _diminish happiness, rather than increase it._ Too many options, it turns out,
  can do more harm than good.


  Coincidently, I had a chance to experience this first hand this weekend, at a
  friend’s cottage. The catch phrase of the weekend was FOMO – “fear of missing
  out”. For a couple of people, every activity decision was a stressful one –
  not because of what the choice provided, but because of what it might not
  provide. Going snowshoeing meant missing out on cross country skiing. Staying
  in to socialize and play games meant potentially missing out on some great
  outdoor adventure. While it turned into a running joke for the getaway
  weekend, “FOMO” acted as a great example of the stress that too much choice
  can inject into our daily decision making.

  ### Imagination trumps option


  > "Insisting on more when one already has a great deal is usually considered a
  sign of greed. In the case of choice, it is also a sign of the failure of
  imagination, which we must avoid or overcome if we wish to solve our multiple
  choice problem."- The Art of Choosing, page 215


  We can use the learnings from the Jam Study, as well as the points in insight
  #1 to make better decisions in our own lives, as well. Just like our clients,
  staff, boss or spouse, we make more definite decisions and are happier with
  our choices when we limit our starting point. Seeking out other options, or
  trying to keep as many doors open as possible may _seem_ prudent, but can
  often be a sign of procrastination or fear of commitment. In our highly
  competitive world, success goes to those who do their research, choose a path
  and then commit to it – fully and completely. Though it may sound
  counterintuitive, (or just plain scary, for some) there is far more to be
  gained from choosing a path and then thinking through interesting and creative
  ways to thrive with that choice than there is with holding back from making a
  decision in the first place. Yes, of course due diligence and a healthy level
  of research is important, but do a gut check on when enough is enough and it’s
  time to commit. Pull the trigger. Then find imaginative ways to turn that
  decision into excellence.


  It’s rare that I find a new author who truly engages. Sadly, most “new
  business books” are fairly mundane – old concepts with slightly shinier
  finishes. First time author, Sheena Iyengar, is the exception. _The Art of
  Choosing_ is a beautifully written book, reminiscent in style to Malcolm
  Gladwell or the
  [_Freakonomics_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/freakonomics/) team of
  Dubner and Levitt. Iyengar has a wonderfully inquisitive mind – asking probing
  questions, and then answering them with solid research projects. She also has
  a fabulous outlook on life. While, as she reminds us, our lives are no doubt
  some formulaic mix of choice, chance and destiny, the power of choice is not
  one to be taken lightly, particularly in our age of infinite selection. Near
  the end of her book, she states:


  “I believe that choice – though it can be finicky, unwieldy, and demanding –
  is ultimately the most powerful determinant of where we go and how we get
  there.”


  I happen to agree.

  ### Magic Number 7 (Plus or Minus 2)


  > "This study shows that people can learn to choose from more options, but
  they're less likely to drown if they start off in the shallows and then slowly
  move toward the deep, all the while building their skills and their nerve."-
  The Art of Choosing, page 212


  Pop quiz – you’re on a German car company’s website, custom building your
  ideal vehicle. You’re presented with 56 color options for the car’s exterior.
  How easily can you make a decision? Now, what if, instead of choosing between
  56 colors, you were asked to choose between 56 engine sizes and
  configurations?


  Unless you’re a mechanic, chances are it’s a lot easier for you to choose
  between colors than between horsepower and torque. 56 engine options (a
  selection process which, thankfully, **_does not_** exist on Audi’s “Audi
  Configurator” site) is in fact so overwhelming for a non-car expert that we
  might give up completely and skip the customization process, going with
  something “off the shelf” instead.


  Compared to car engines, color is something most of us are comfortable
  deciding. So of course the color decision is an easier one. There’s something
  else going on here, though. Let’s imagine that instead of 56 engine options,
  there were 4. How are you feeling about making **that** decision? Suddenly,
  it’s a whole new story. We can research the differences between four engine
  types. We can weigh the pros and cons, imagine each in action in our day to
  day lives, and make a decision that fits our unique needs. We’d probably enjoy
  the process too – feeling good about the final decision we made. In fact,
  research shows that we would likely enjoy and be more confident in our
  decision on one of four engine types than we would in the decision of one of
  fifty-six paint colors, even with limited knowledge or experience in the world
  of auto mechanics. Better still, if we could make the 1 in 4 decision
  **first**, we may find it easier to make the 1 in 56 decision afterwards.


  It turns out that there’s an optimal limit to the level of choice we are
  provided with. That limit is seven, plus or minus two. In study after study,
  it’s been proven that we are best at making decisions (and being happy with
  the outcome) when we have between 5 and 9 options to choose from. (Check out
  pages 177 – 185 of _The Art of Choosing_ for more insight into this
  fascinating conclusion).


  So, the learning here is this – if you want people to engage with you and make
  a decision, work to present them with _less_ options, not more. Be it your
  boss, your client, your spouse, or your staff, recognize that people
  fundamentally crave freedom of choice… and then make it easy on them by
  limiting the options.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A behavioural psychologist sets up a taste testing booth in a specialty supermarket. On alternating days, she puts out 30 flavours of jam for consumers to try. The other days she puts out only six flavours. In both cases, people who stop try, on average, two flavours before receiving a coupon for $1 off, and continuing with their shopping. (More on this study in a second)

Did you just register that? **Thirty flavours of jam**. The fact that this didn’t faze you should tell you something – we are inundated by choice.

The freedom to choose is a powerful one. Our Western culture is built on it, and the globalization of the last 20 years has only pushed it to the next level. Do a quick Google search for “jam”, “shoes” or “sunglasses” (or virtually any other product, for that matter), and you’ll instantly be supplied with literally _hundreds of thousands of options._ But why? Because we demanded it. Because, the rationale goes, “if choice is good, then more choice is better”. Because we want an opportunity to express our individuality – our unique tastes – at every turn.

As Sheena Iyengar explores in _The Art of Choosing_, however, there may be a limit to the value of exponentially increasing options. And, most interestingly, there may actually be _harm_ in going too far. Which brings us back to the Jam study…
