  ### Explanations are an unrecognized skill we all have


  > "Explanation is a skill we can improve and put to work in achieving our
  goals."- The Art of Explanation, page 5


  Of all the tactics for communicating, explanations represent an unparalleled
  opportunity to make your ideas understandable to others. But the odd thing
  about them is that we don’t necessarily consciously think about it as we are
  doing it, and LeFever points out that because of that we never consider the
  possibilities for improving our explanation skills. Herein lies a great
  opportunity to leverage.


  From his past experience, LeFever gives a number of examples where
  corporations missed an opportunity to make their ideas, products, or services
  understandable to their customers. If you think about all of the
  communications you come into contact with on a daily basis, it becomes very
  apparent that the memorable ones are the ones that provide a solid explanation
  of the company, product, brand, etc. I personally can think of dozens of
  websites that leave much to be desired because they don’t properly articulate
  who the company (or person) is and what they are about. As a business, this
  leaves you disadvantaged when it comes time to capture their attention again,
  or try to convert them to customers.


  LeFever goes on to provide readers with systems they can follow to explain
  their ideas. He submits that a good explanation requires three steps:
  planning, presenting, and packaging.

  ### Know your audience and empathize with them


  > "A single word can make your explanation fail because it lowers
  confidence."- The Art of Explanation, page 27


  This sentence really stuck out to me as I think this is where most
  explanations go awry. **When you’re immersed in your craft, it can be a
  challenge to shift your perspective to that of your audience.** But it is what
  you _must_ do in order for your explanation to make sense to them. LeFever
  suggests that explanations commonly fail because the audience loses confidence
  in their ability to understand something new. Therefore, we must empathize
  with their perspective as we explain our idea.


  LeFever states that your goal is to move someone from point A to point D with
  your explanation. In order to do this, you must really understand that
  person’s starting point. What do they know? What kind of context do they have
  for what I’m going to tell them? If I didn’t know x, y and z, what would I
  need to know to understand this idea? Once you’ve grappled with those
  questions, you can start to map out what they would need to know to reach
  point D. This ground work is essential for determining how best to present and
  package an explanation.

  ### Explanations can be a strategy in problem solving


  > "Looking at a problem through the lens of explanation can reveal challenges
  that may not have been visible before."- The Art of Explanation, xii


  This concept radically shifted my perspective about the function of
  communication and explanations. Fundamentally, they are attempting to solve
  the same problem. Both in personal and business settings we often face the
  dilemma of trying to get someone to adapt our point of view in order to take
  some action. The success of this really hinges on our ability to explain our
  perspective to someone else in a way that makes sense to them.


  Understanding that this is how persuasion, marketing, etc. should be
  approached makes one realize the abundant strategic opportunities explanations
  present us with. **Just imagine how different your next staff meeting could be
  if everyone understood how to effectively explain their ideas**. Pretty
  radical, right?
f_conclusion: >-
  In the book’s epilogue, LeFever says his hope is that his readers will become
  “explanation specialists.” A very admirable goal and one I think he achieves
  by creating awareness in the reader’s mind and then providing them with a
  clear road map to creating a great explanation. Even if your job is not in
  communications, this book has practical applications for anyone because as
  LeFever points out, **explanation is something we all do.**

Ever have one of those moments where you were trying to get a co-worker to understand your point of view? And remember a time as a child when you were trying to convince your parents that candy makes a _great_ dinner?

Throughout our lives, there are hundreds of instances when we are given the challenge of explaining ourselves, our ideas, or our perspective to other people. In his book _The Art of Explanation_, Lee LeFever dissects what it means to explain something and provides readers with a road map for explaining their ideas. He also provides a useful definition of an explanation – describing facts in a way that makes them understandable – and underscores the idea that **explanations should answer the question “why” and make people care.**

LeFever hails from a corporate communication background and while the book is slanted towards business explanations, it is easy to see how you could apply those principles in non-business contexts.
