  ### Innovation Begins With An Eye


  > "It’s not even enough to ask people what they think about a product or
  idea."- The Art of Innovation, page 26


  _“Just ask them.”_


  That’s a common approach we take when we’re unsure of someone’s needs, wants
  or requirements.


  What do they want for lunch? Just ask them.  

  Should I print in color or black and white? Just ask them.


  It’s also a common approach when it comes to product development. In fact,
  it’s something I was taught in school (to understand end user requirements,
  simply ask and document as “Use Cases”).


  But, as Tom mentions in _The Art of Innovation_, if you _truly_ want to be
  innovative, it’s not enough to “Just Ask”. You have to _observe_ as well.


  _“What do stand-up toothpaste tubes, all-in-one fishing kits, high-tech blood
  analyzers, flexible office shelves, and self-healing sports bottles have in
  common? Nothing actually, except that they’re all IDEO-designed products that
  were inspired by watching real people.”_


  Why isn’t “just asking” enough? Two reasons:


  **Reason 1:** “One reason is the same factor that prevents you from learning
  that your meat loaf tastes like sawdust. Your dinner guests are too polite to
  tell you the unvarnished truth, too wrapped in trying to give you the expected
  answer… How many people volunteer that they’re having a lousy day? It’s human
  nature to put on a bright face on a dismal situation.”


  **Reason 2:** “A second reason for the ‘fine’ response is that your guests
  don’t know or can’t articulate the ‘true’ answer. Maybe the meat loaf needs
  more salt or less onion. The problem is that your guests may like to eat, but
  they’re probably not food critics. In business, too, your customers may lack
  the vocabulary or the palate to explain what’s wrong, and especially what’s
  missing. Companies shouldn’t ask them to.”

  ### Find The Rule Breakers & See Products In Motion


  > "Finding the right people to observe helps."- The Art of Innovation, page 39


  Of course, not everyone is the same.


  Not everyone reads the instruction or training manual. In fact, some of us
  barely skim it, if at all. We tend to just “get started” using the product or
  service without much reference or training most of the time. Trying to use it
  as we intuitively would.


  These “rule breakers” are the people you want to observe. They’re the ones
  that will use your product or service in a way you didn’t imagine. And it will
  open your eyes to new possibilities.


  _“People who follow directions perfectly and can’t imagine a different course
  aren’t much help. You learn more from the woman who takes a shortcut, who
  forces the product to do something the manual says it can’t, who imagines what
  it might do if only… You learn from the people who break the rules.”_


  Tom recalls the story of a project to make common phone tasks such as
  three-way calling easier. They observed one of their travel agents, Sally, go
  around the room to grab 10 phones and place them in a circle to have a
  conference call because she found the three way calling system too confusing.
  Sally admitted that this approach was “crazy”, but it worked for her.


  You might think this is crazy as well, but as Tom says, “Look for the Sallys
  of your business.”


  They’re the ones who try to integrate your product or service into their daily
  life as easily, quickly and painlessly, as they can. They _just use it_.


  Isn’t that the ultimate goal? To integrate it into their lives as seamlessly
  as possible?


  As Tom suggests, “See products as verbs… and you’ll become more attuned to how
  people use products, spaces, services – whatever you’re trying to improve.”


  And finding people to observe doesn’t mean you need to formally survey and
  gather a focus group. It’s much simpler than that actually. A common practice
  IDEO follows is emailing the team, and others, to see if anyone has friends
  that fit the profile they’re looking for, and ask if they can be observed
  while using the new product or service.

  ### Spend Time In The Jungle


  > "If you’re not in the jungle, you’re not going to know the tiger."- The Art
  of Innovation, page 31


  Sure, you could read about the Tiger. Maybe watch a National Geographic
  documentary.


  But you won’t _truly_ understand the Tiger that way.  

  You won’t _truly_ understand how it interacts with each aspect of the
  jungle.  

  How it balances hunting for food and protecting its family at the same time.


  No. To _truly_ understand the Tiger, you need to, as Tom says, “Spend Time
  _In_ The Jungle”.


  And the same is true for innovation._  

  Go_ to your customers’ environment. And I don’t mean go in for a meeting.  

  You need to go and _observe_ them. Go “shadow” them like a fly on the wall
  (think “job shadowing”).


  Seriously. And no, setting up a video conference isn’t the same.  

  You need to be in the _same_ environment as your customers.


  Because that’s the only way to truly _see_, and _understand_, how they react
  to, interact with, and more importantly, _naturally_ use your product or
  service.


  Are they experiencing the product or service as you expected?  

  Or are they using it in a way you didn’t think they would?


  You will almost definitely be surprised at the results; walking away with new
  ideas to refine your product or service for the better (which can ultimately
  lead to faster adoption).
f_conclusion: >-
  Keen observation is just one part of the innovation methodology Tom shares in
  The Art of Innovation (my other favorite is “The Perfect Brainstorm”). But, no
  matter what approach you use, regardless of your product, industry or
  position, often the best way to get better at innovating (like many things in
  life) is to _practice, practice, practice!_

_“How can you/we become more creative and innovative?”_

I’m sure that question has come up more than once.  
And I’m sure you want to hear the answer.

Lucky for us, Tom Kelley, General Manager of award-winning global design firm IDEO, decided to write a book about just that.

In _The Art of Innovation: Lessons in Creativity from IDEO, America’s Leading Design Firm_, Tom shares the strategy and approach IDEO has taken to develop everything from the Apple mouse, to a portable heart defibrillator, to the Palm handheld.

Or, as Tom puts it: “A Method To Our Madness”.

So where should you start?  
With your Innovation _Eye,_ of course!

_“Just ask them.”_

That’s a common approach we take when we’re unsure of someone’s needs, wants or requirements.

It’s also a common approach when it comes to product development. In fact, it’s something I was taught in school (to understand end user requirements, simply ask and document as “Use Cases”).

But, as Tom mentions in _The Art of Innovation_, if you _truly_ want to be innovative, it’s not enough to “Just Ask”. You have to _observe_ as well.

_“What do stand-up toothpaste tubes, all-in-one fishing kits, high-tech blood analyzers, flexible office shelves, and self-healing sports bottles have in common? Nothing actually, except that they’re all IDEO-designed products that were inspired by watching real people.”_

Why isn’t “just asking” enough? Two reasons:

**Reason 1:** “One reason is the same factor that prevents you from learning that your meat loaf tastes like sawdust. Your dinner guests are too polite to tell you the unvarnished truth, too wrapped in trying to give you the expected answer… How many people volunteer that they’re having a lousy day? It’s human nature to put on a bright face on a dismal situation.”

### Spend Time In The Jungle

No. To _truly_ understand the Tiger, you need to, as Tom says, “Spend Time _In_ The Jungle”.

And the same is true for innovation._

But, no matter what approach you use, regardless of your product, industry or position, often the best way to get better at innovating (like many things in life) is to _practice, practice, practice!_

_“Innovation isn’t about perfection. You’ve got to shank a few before your swing smoothes out. Get out there and observe your market, your customers and products. Brainstorm like crazy and prototype in bursts.”_

At the end of the day, perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind is that you have to be willing to take some risks.

_“Sitting on the sidelines, waiting for the ‘riskless breakthrough’ or the ‘ideal risk’ to come along, doesn’t work. Those who try to scientifically measure opportunities sometimes miss the boat.”_
