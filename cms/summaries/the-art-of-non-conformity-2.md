  ### Fear as a Driver of Success


  > "Always do what you are afraid to do."- Ralph Waldo Emerson, as quoted in
  The Art of Non-Conformity, page 49


  Imagine stepping up to a start line of a race and being indifferent to the
  fear and pressure of succeeding. Light as a feather, heart rate stabilized,
  not a worry in the world—how would you perform? What drives you? Guillebeau
  echoes the sentiments we have heard so often: fear is a driver of success. It
  is an indicator that we are pushing boundaries and living and performing
  outside of the average or expected. Fear is what makes us feel alive, and as
  active participants in our life path, and harnessing that fear in a positive
  direction of change and in favour of fulfillment is what Guillebeau encourages
  his readers to do. He suggests there are three steps to do this:


  1.  **Staring Down the Brick Wall of Fear  
      **_“Conquering fear begins with acknowledging fear.”_
  2.  Guillebeau argues that our fear is often enticed by deep seated
  expectations or false understandings, so if you really stare it in the face,
  question it, and dig in it often, it becomes less of an obstacle and more of a
  motivator.


  2.  **Building the Net  
      **_“Apply the ‘no-regrets’ mind-set. After acknowledging fear, you then need to change your mind-set and prepare for making a change.”_
  3.  This is often a highly personalized approach and will play directly into
  what you place value and importance on; however, there are three valuable
  “nets” to put in place that Guillebeau shares in this section. The first,
  imagine the worst case scenario and you will (or should) come to recognize the
  consequences of inaction are far more limiting than what could grow from
  change. The second, it is important to rally a group of supporters and mentors
  to guide you through the blockers or hold you true to your original intent
  when your inspiration wanes. Lastly, set yourself up for rewards along the way
  that serve as reminders and motivators. All three combined make the potential
  consequences seem less limiting and far less isolating.


  3.  **Smashing Through the Wall  
      **_“This is where you stop wavering and decide one way or the other if you’re going to take the leap.”_
  4.  Now that you have moved past the blockers of fear and insecurity, the real
  challenge comes with taking steps to move in a new direction. This stage is
  based solely on action, moving out of the dream phase, through the blocker
  (both real and assumed) phase and into the movement phase. What do you want to
  do? What will get you there?

  ### Legacy


  > "Wherever you are in life, however old you are, begin thinking about every
  day as the first day of your life. The recognition that all we have is today
  brings about a combination of good and bad news. The good news is that the
  failures have already taken place. There’s no need to continue reliving them
  in your head. The bad news is that the successes are locked away too."- The
  Art of Non-Conformity, page 207


  The danger of success is that we relinquish that period of time to the “glory
  days”, assuming that our best days are behind us and that our impact on the
  world around us is nominal from here onwards. Rather, the art of
  non-conformity is to push onwards and upwards, living a little extra each day
  as a way of redefining fulfillment, success and legacy.


  The ultimate goal, Guillebeau argues, is to build something that is the
  perfect complement to your ability and your passion, all while helping others.
  “If you like the idea of having more glory days, and you don’t want to retire
  from the sense of being alive, you need to work toward building a legacy.”

  ### Convergence


  > "Convergence is a state of being where everything in our lives is in
  alignment."- The Art of Non-Conformity, page 173


  Otherwise known as a state of happiness, convergence is achieved when
  everything you place value on is active and abundant. Whether that is in
  relationships, exercise, work or other elements of a daily routine, you are
  doing more of what you love and enjoy and less of what weighs you down or
  makes you unfulfilled. “To achieve convergence,” writes Guillebeau, “two
  separate (but related activities) are required: saying goodbye to unnecessary
  tasks, obligations and expectations—then welcoming in a wide range of other
  things that enrich our lives.”


  We, as a society, are so bound my external expectations, that it is such a
  radical thought to live with such abandon, to trudge forward in a way that is
  motivated by the ultimate quest for fulfillment. Guillebeau encourages readers
  to ask two very important questions when faced with an expectation: “Why
  should I do this?” and “What will happen if I don’t?” He argues that “as you
  begin to implement this practice, you’ll gradually learn to discern necessary
  from unnecessary obligations. The next step is to say no to as many
  unnecessary obligations as possible.”


  Not only are most of us driven by external expectations, but so often we are
  deterred from seeking out or capturing opportunities to fill ourselves up, so
  the next step after denouncing obligations is “welcoming a life of abundance,
  filled to the brim with things you enjoy doing and that leave a legacy.” He
  argues that there is a difference between that feeling of exhaustion after
  trudging through a day filled with the fulfillment of obligations, versus the
  exhaustion that comes with investing positive energy in a project or quest
  that expands your mind, heart and soul.

  Whether you are comfortable where you are, or hungry and craving more,
  Guillebeau has equipped you with the tools, the lessons and the encouragement
  to move in the direction of the unknown. To squash fear you must embrace it,
  to find direction you must look inward, and to build a legacy you must find
  the gaps and fill them. While an easy read, it is an empowering read—one that
  lights a fire and demands attention. Are you living you’re most remarkable
  life?

> "The tragedy of life is not so much what we suffer, but rather what we miss." _\- Thomas Carlyle, quoted in The Art of Non-Conformity, page 19_

Chris Guillebeau is no stranger to ingenuity. In _The Art of Non-Conformity_ he set out to squash the average, predetermined life plan and enlist a group of readers that abandon their preconceptions, challenge the norm and forge their own path in the direction of what makes their creativity and passion thrive. Written for a unique group of motivated and hungry readers, he is unapologetically bold—he anticipates the blockers his readers will likely foresee, reveals the ultimate rewards of exploration, and sprinkles in the encouragement necessary to inspire the first step. By sharing very real and inspiring stories of boundary-pushers, Guillebeau has crafted a book that will inspire even the most comfortable reader to crave more.
