  ### Dominating through Convergence


  > "When faced with uncertainty about taking a leap of faith, take the leap."-
  The Art of Non-Conformity, page 40


  _The Art of Non-Conformity_ presents relentless individualism in a different
  spirit. It certainly isn’t violence, martyrdom, megalomania, heroism, or
  rebellion without purpose.


  Some might mistake creative self-employment and the pursuit of radical goals
  as egotistical and self-centered, but these are just blanket condemnations
  rooted in a false dichotomy: the choice of either serving yourself versus
  serving others. Chris says this is the wrong choice. Instead, seek convergence
  where you strike harmony between doing good things for yourself while still
  making the world a better place for others.


  Convergence is a state of being when you’re pursuing a life of alignment and
  abundance. You know you’re close to it when you see some of the following
  signs:


  *   You’re in good health,

  *   Your relationships with friends and family are also in good health.

  *   You’re excited about your work

  *   You’re regularly engaged in healthy challenges and adventures.


  People may realize that their careers or jobs have outworn their charm, and
  that some existential questions about themselves remain unanswered. The path
  to convergence begins by asking what you really want to get out of life. Chris
  presents some questions that can help in your pursuit:


  *   What needs can you meet?

  *   Who looks to you as a leader?

  *   What bothers you about the world?

  *   How can you make things better?

  *   What can you offer the world that no one else can?


  Then, how would you craft your plan of action? What’s a more effective or
  efficient way to achieve it? When you start thinking this way, you’ll start
  eliminating what’s unnecessary. You’ll find that sometimes things like formal
  qualifications and intelligence aren’t necessary prerequisites, but just
  purpose and determination to make it happen.

  ### Fear of Change


  > "Fear is normal! The goal is to conquer the fear, not to avoid it or pretend
  it doesn't exist."- The Art of Non-Conformity, page 66


  The other disclaimer of the _Art of Non-Conformity_ is to take responsibility
  by taking action. Some may desire change but never act. They’re frozen in
  stasis. It can mean the difference between a full leap of faith and a
  halfhearted hop.


  While the gatekeepers and sleepwalkers can easily be ignored, the greatest
  obstacle is your fear.


  Chris says that fear isn’t irrelevant at all: They’re the battle scars from
  past criticism and neglect by sleepwalkers and gatekeepers. The after effects
  might’ve drifted into the present, but the fear right now is self-imposed,
  manufactured, and exaggerated, and they shouldn’t define the future.


  Some people just aren’t ready to pursue their true ambitions. But what’s
  common is that people who have created some remarkable lives for themselves
  had to make key choices to overcome the fear.


  Right before a big decision, the ultimate obstacle is always you. Don’t
  pretend fear doesn’t exist. Smash through its wall by forcing the active
  decision. The active decision is the obvious choice which moves things
  forward.


  Some helpful questions Chris presents: _“What’s the worst that could happen?”_
  or _“What really waits beyond the wall of fear?”_


  _“Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with their song
  still in them.”_


  _\-Henry David Thoreau (AONC, as quoted in p. 3)_


  Our educational lives begin with an innate spark. Throughout time it dims as
  we plod along believing the illusion of choices presented to us. Chris reveals
  that rather than guided soul-searching, we are encouraged to descend into
  “occupational planning,” filling someone else’s role instead of creating our
  own. The spark doesn’t reemerge until a crisis hits later in life.


  _“There is almost always more than one way to accomplish something.” (pg. 39)_


  Ask yourself what makes you unique? How do you define your true abilities and
  how can you best deliver it to those around you? Sometimes, that’s exactly
  what the world needs from you. No authority or sleepwalker can decide or
  validate that for you.


  The rest of the book contains many hidden gems and tools for pursuing a
  meaningful life, including contrarian travel and other testament from
  entrepreneurs who have become non-conformists. But before you can design the
  life you want, you must remember what really matters.


  _The Art of Non-Conformity_ is a reminder to be alive again, and live.

  ### Who's Stopping You?


  > "As long as what you want does not cause harm to others, you never need to
  apologize for pursuing your own dreams and big ideas. They belong to you for a
  reason."- The Art of Non-Conformity, page 37


  After clarifying your true ambitions and embarking on your journey, many new
  people will come your way. Some will support the meaning of your quest, but
  there will be some who will try to discredit and stop you. This second camp of
  people is comprised of two types: **Sleepwalkers** and **Gatekeepers**.


  Sleepwalkers are the conformist majority and passive energy vampires who are
  ruffled by anything new. They’re comfortable with staring through the glass
  while dragging others into the dark crypt of excuses of “being practical” or
  “being reasonable.” They can only defend their case by reciting “history” even
  if their recollection is vague, inaccurate, or incomplete.


  They’re there to justify the real world and remind you of your impending
  failure.


  Gatekeepers keep the sleepwalkers in their place. They block access to what
  really matters. They’re the “No” people who limit the choices and reinforce
  the busywork. They’re the ones who directly prevent you from reinventing from
  the inside or doing remarkable things for yourself and others. Rulebooks are
  the canon which gives their authority legitimacy. They’re skillful at
  marginalizing, demoralizing, and using circular reasoning as a lukewarm
  defense, but that’s their job: To enforce the status quo.


  Chris is warranted to mention the candid truth that people will try to
  outright discredit you even when “business-as-usual,” conventions, and common
  assumptions have clearly outlived themselves. Question those agendas. Why do
  these people, these “Gatekeepers” value preserving things as they are? The
  point is to discern who is really worth your time and energy along the
  journey. Sometimes you don’t have to directly confront the forces that try to
  stop you. You can kindly proceed and go your separate way as you intended
  without asking for forgiveness or permission.

> "There's nothing wrong with thinking ahead, but life does not start at 65." _\- The Art of Non-Conformity, page 24_

During the early part of our careers, we’re made to believe that success is linear, and that we need permission and outside validation to fit into society.

In his refreshingly different book, _The Art of Non-Conformity: Set Your Own Rules, Live the Life You Want, and Change the World_, author, global traveler and entrepreneur, Chris Guillebeau begins with a stringent conclusion: **the typical path to success is a deferred life**, **and it was designed to make you embrace safety and mediocrity.** The freedom we think we have is just a set of limitations imposed and enforced by others. And so, to create the life we want, we need to challenge those limitations.

The idea of challenging norms resonates with new and veteran entrepreneurs alike; entrepreneurs who defected from the traditional path and finally addressed the lingering concern that there may be more to life than that which proclaimed by experts, authorities, and the passively conformist majority. However, Chris Guillebeau warns the newcomer about what happens when you take a stand and pursue your independence.

The _Art of Non-Conformity (AONC)_ is a manifesto and precursor to entrepreneurial thinking. It reveals what’s evident now, in our 21st century world, and why you shouldn’t back down. The AONC reignites the spark that was once snuffed out so that you can (re)start designing the life you truly want.
