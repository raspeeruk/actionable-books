  ### Go One Step Further


  > "Significance is a higher state of happiness and fulfillment beyond the
  merely successful. Attaining significance means becoming aware of your purpose
  and working hard to bring that out in the world."- The Art of Significance,
  page 4


  Few people will remember the title on your business card or the size of your
  checking account. Yet, it’s easy to get caught up in measuring success in
  terms of material wealth. From the time we are young, marketers pound us with
  messages that glorify consuming and collecting “things”. Teachers and even
  family members place a premium on prestige and position in the professional
  world. And in the midst of all of it, we lose sight of the real opportunity we
  have – to go beyond “finding happiness on a superficial level” and focus on
  leaving “our families, friends, coworkers, neighborhoods, and countries in
  better shape than we first encountered them.”


  To help you accomplish this task, Clark offers these Twelve Laws of
  Significance and with each law he demonstrates how to go from success to
  significance:


  *   Practice Obedience Instead of Free Will Agency

  *   Exercise Perseverance Instead of Patience

  *   Proactively Stretch Instead of Change

  *   Trust Predictability Instead of Hope and Faith

  *   Know the Whole Truth Instead of Believing What You Think

  *   Focus on Winning Instead of Team

  *   Do Right Instead of Seeking to Be Best

  *   Experience Harmony Instead of Forcing Balance

  *   Accept Others Instead of Judging Them

  *   Love and Be Needed Instead of Romanced and Used

  *   Establish Covenants Instead of Making Commitments


  You need not master them all at once. As with many things, significance is
  about the journey, not the destination.

  ### The Truth Will Set You Free


  > "Feedback is the breakfast of champions, telling us more of the truth so we
  can adjust our actions."- The Art of Significance, page 93


  The Seventh Law addresses feedback – specifically the importance of seeking it
  out as a vehicle for improvement. As Clark says, “the quicker we recognize
  weakness, mediocrity, misdirection, or failure, the easier and more cost
  effective it is to fix it, change it, and get ourselves back on track toward
  our desired destination.”


  He suggests there are three forms of feedback people should seek:


  1. **Factual Feedback** – constitutes the cold, hard facts of our current
  reality, data to which we assign accountability without blame.  

  2\. **Motivational Feedback** – the cheering crowd and encouraging coach who
  tell us, “You can do it – go for it.” We need motivational feedback to get us
  to hustle; it triggers the adrenaline and endorphins we need to compete.  

  3\. **Educational Feedback** – correctional coaching.


  Motivational feedback is generally easy to find. We all have someone who
  cheers us on no matter what. Someone who urges us to go one step farther.
  Similarly education feedback is available. If you don’t have access to it
  readily, you can hire a coach.


  But getting valuable (timely, candid, and constructive) factual feedback is a
  skill in and of itself. Many people aren’t comfortable giving constructive
  feedback. They don’t like telling you what you could be doing better or what
  you’re doing wrong. They don’t want to hurt your feelings.


  Knowing this, there are a few things you can do to facilitate getting better
  feedback. Create an environment where people feel safe and comfortable being
  honest. Don’t be defensive. Listen. Ask for specific examples. And most
  importantly, use the feedback to make yourself better. That’s the best way to
  show people you are serious about improving yourself.

  ### Look Inside Yourself


  > "Mere change is foisted upon us from outside; we react to the demands of
  others, including bosses, parents, and coaches. Stretch, by contrast, follows
  from our own heartfelt commitment to become more of who we already are -
  everything we have the potential to be, both personally and
  organizationally."- The Art of Significance, page 53


  With the Third Law – Proactively Stretch Instead of Change, Clark does a
  brilliant job of reframing how we should view change. Mantras like “change is
  hard” and “no one likes change” play like a broken record when it comes to
  business and personal development. Sure it’s hard and miserable when it’s
  forced on you. When you’re only doing it because someone else wants you to,
  where is the intrinsic motivation? What will you grab onto when it gets tough?
  No wonder you resist.


  Significance is about learning to stretch yourself, not following someone
  else’s agenda. Start by focusing on what’s meaningful and important to you.
  When the motivation to go beyond your comfort zone is an internal force, when
  “you determine why, when, where, and how – resistance melts away.”


  Even though the motivation for stretching is deeply personal, achieving
  significance is not a solo effort. Making improvements can be difficult work.
  Find and surround yourself with people who will support your growth.

  books that have come before it and puts a new twist on them. The concept of
  focusing on significance rather than success is one I find worth exploring.

> "Personal success, what we do for ourselves, dies with us, but significance, what we do for others, remains and is ever-lasting." _\- The Art of Significance, page 7_

If you’re like most people, you probably spend time thinking about success.

What does it look like for you? Does it include landing a certain job, buying your dream house, or earning a certain income? Does it involve traveling or more time for your hobbies?

These all seem like reasonable characteristics of success, but in his latest book _The Art of Significance_, Dan Clark says if your only aim is success, you are aiming too low. As you can guess from the title, **the real reward lies in becoming significant.**
