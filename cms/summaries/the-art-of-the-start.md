  ### Balancing Microscopes & Telescopes


  > "The reality is you need both microscopes and telescopes to achieve
  success."- The Art of the Start, Page xi


  At the outset of _The Art of the Start,_ Kawasaki talks about the
  rollercoaster so many of us go through in our business lives, particularly
  when starting something new: At the beginning of the project, or after a big
  win, we’re focused on the horizon – long term thinking and optimistic
  planning. When things are bad, or we’ve been too long without a win, we dive
  into the granular details of the business. So often, we live too long at one
  extreme or the other. Yet, it’s crucial to our success that we do spend time
  thinking about both. The trick is to incorporate a **balance** between the two
  extremes, and to do so in a way that allows us to be most effective in each.


  The idea of balancing vision and reality simultaneously is not a new one. In
  [_Good to Great_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/good-to-great/), Jim
  Collins defined the “Stockdale Paradox” as the skill of combining an
  optimistic sense of where you’re headed with a healthy comprehension of where
  you are currently. Guy Kawasaki refers to it telescopes and microscopes.
  Whatever you call it, it’s an important skill we could all benefit from
  acquiring. The following two Insights provide some tactical insights from _The
  Art of the Start_ on how to establish (and maintain) this important balance.

  ### Embrace Agnostics (not Atheists)


  > "By definition, reference accounts are already successful and established.
  Usually, they benefit from the perpetuation of the status quo. Herein lies the
  problem: If you have an innovative product or service, these accounts are the
  least likely to embrace it. They are atheists when it comes to a new religion
  because they are the high priests of an old order."- The Art of the Start,
  page 199


  “Reference accounts”, as Kawasaki describes them, are your dream customers –
  companies or individuals – who, if convinced to use your product, become major
  sources of credibility when others are considering buying from you. (Having
  Microsoft as a client, as an example, makes you look more legit than having
  “Ted’s Computers” as a client) Of course, we all want key influencers on board
  with our new endeavours. It’s worth remembering, however that these entities
  typically have less to gain and more to lose from partnering with you, because
  they’re already enjoying success from using what’s worked in the past.


  When looking to grow a following, focus on the people/organizations that are
  open to something new; those who have pain points with the current solution.
  They may not be actively looking for a new solution, but they’re also not
  actively promoting the very status quo you’re looking to topple. These are the
  agnostics that may be converted to your cause if you have a chance to explain
  it to them. Focus on these guys, regardless of their size or stature.


  _The Art of the Start_ embodies the very concept it teaches – focusing
  simultaneously on both the strategy and executional elements of starting
  something new. Written with an easy, conversational style, this book is a must
  have for all entrepreneurs, whether they’re starting a wholly new business or
  starting a revolution within a larger organization. I, for one, plan to keep
  it close at hand in the years yet to come.

  ### Define the Beachhead


  > "A beachhead, in this context, means a market that is small enough so that
  larger competitors are not already going after it, and big enough so that if
  you're successful, you can reach critical mass and profitability with it."-
  The Art of the Start, page 33


  All successful endeavours start with a passion for great change. And that’s
  important. “A little bit better” is too easy to dismiss or ignore completely.
  People are inspired by visions of a brighter future. And yet, as leaders of
  change, we need to acknowledge that global domination is a piece by piece
  process.


  If you’re looking to create sweeping, lasting change, consider starting with
  penetrating (and dominating) a specific, smaller market. Be sure the market –
  the beachhead – is large enough to be considered a real success if won, but is
  also manageable with the limited resources you inevitably have at your
  disposal. The key to identifying an appropriate beachhead is to understand and
  embrace a delicate balance of belief and humility.

_The Art of the Start_ is the very best book I’ve read to date on maximizing the strategic and tactical efforts of a start up business. Perhaps what I enjoyed most about it, however, is that it’s a book for _all_ entrepreneurs – those starting businesses and non-profits, certainly, but also those aspiring to lead change in existing organizations.

In fact, author Guy Kawasaki actually redefines the word “entrepreneur” in the introduction of his book, where he says “The reality is that ‘entrepreneur’ is not a job title. It is a _state of mind_ of people who want to alter the future.” (_The Art of the Start,_ page xii)

So, in addition to providing great advice on how to pitch for funding, bootstrap, hire your first key employees, and other important lessons for entrepreneurs involved in start ups, _The Art of the Start_ also offers some fantastic lessons that we can all benefit from, regardless of our professional realities.
