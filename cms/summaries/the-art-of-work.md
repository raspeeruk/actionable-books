  ### The Ultimate Intersection


  > "Discovering your calling is not an epiphany, but a series of intentional
  decisions. It looks less like a giant leap and more like building a bridge."-
  The Art of Work, page 87


  A great axiom used in our world today is to find the intersection of what you
  love and what the world needs. This has played out recently in my organization
  where a project that needed more organization and better management was
  identified. Initially, when asked to lead this project, I really struggled
  with getting involved. I almost missed an opportunity. By listening to the
  advice of others and making the decision to apply my skills in this situation
  both the organization and I are reaping the benefits. Over time, I have
  discovered my love for research, organization, planning and implementation.
  Now I’ve been given the chance to take the skills I love and apply them to a
  project that needs them. This creates the proverbial win-win situation. I get
  to do some of the things I enjoy, and the organization benefits from having a
  more efficiently managed project.

  ### Generalist or Specialist?


  > "Your calling is not just one thing; it's a few things. The trick is not to
  be a jack of all trades, but to become a master of some."- The Art of Work,
  page 133


  One of the stated objectives for employee development in the organization I
  work for is to make everyone a generalist, not a specialist. This, in my
  opinion, is a mistake. Experience has taught me that the more complex the
  process the more important it is to have specialists working it. Who would you
  choose to perform a delicate surgery on your brain – a general family
  physician or a specialized neurosurgeon? The reality is that most of us are
  hardwired for a handful of activities and are not really good at a broad
  spectrum of things.


  When we look at our lives in general there are some key areas that we need to
  focus on specifically. These include our work, our relationships, and how we
  recreate. All of these involve our purpose or what we are meant to do. Don’t
  we want to know our time on earth has meant something? We are called to higher
  purposes than self-gratifying activities. We are called to invest in others;
  long-term, as we pour into the lives of our loved ones, or just for a season
  as we contribute to those who briefly cross our path.

  ### Making Lemonade from Lemons


  > "Your calling is not always easy. It will take work. Practice can teach you
  what you are and are not meant to do."- The Art of Work, page 57


  Think back on an experience in your life when you worked at something but
  ultimately learned that it was not for you. One such experience for me was
  when my parents wished to instill in me their enjoyment of instrumental music
  and insisted that I take piano and trombone lessons. During the years that I
  was forced to take music lessons, it certainly felt like hard work. Musical
  practice did not yield melodious perfection in my case, however. It rather
  confirmed for me that ivory keys and gilded brass were meant for someone else.
  Ultimately, I quit playing the piano and actually threw my trombone in a trash
  dumpster when I moved away from home.


  Conversely, I was not taught or encouraged to manage money while growing up.
  After leaving home, I became interested in successful financial principles and
  how to apply them in my life. Fortunately, I found a mentor who taught and
  encouraged me in this area. To this day I enjoy managing money and I am
  reaping the benefits of doing so.
f_conclusion: >-
  Jeff reminds us that our individual calling is more than a career; it is a
  life well lived. As stated above, our calling touches the various areas of
  life – work, family, and recreation. Our calling is not a destination; it is a
  journey that does not end until we pass from this earth. In the end, success
  is not so much about what we do or accomplish during our life as much as it is
  about the legacy we leave behind. What is your legacy?

> "Don't settle for the status quo. Live a life that matters." _\- The Art of Work, back cover_

The subtitle of this book is “a proven path to discovering what you were meant to do.” Have you ever asked the question “What should I do with my life?” This book attempts to assist the reader in answering that question and to assist in finding one’s calling.

Each of us should always be cognizant of what we can do versus what we cannot do. The path to one’s life work is difficult and risky, even scary, which is why few finish the journey. This is a book about discovering our life’s work – that treasure of immeasurable worth we all long for. It’s about the task we were born to do. As Jeff Goins explains, the search begins with passion but does not end there. Only when our interests connect with the needs of the world do we begin to live for a larger purpose. Those who experience this intersection experience something exceptional and enviable. Though it is rare, such a life is attainable by anyone brave enough to try. Through personal experience, compelling case studies, and current research on the mysteries of motivation and talent, Jeff shows readers how to find their vocation and what to expect along the way.
