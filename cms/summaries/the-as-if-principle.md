  ### Acting As If You Feel (Or Don't Feel) Something Will Make It True


  > "If you want a quality, act as if you already have it."- William James,
  quoted in The As If Principle, page vi


  Ever heard of a laugh club? People get together and laugh. Not at something or
  someone. They just laugh.


  And it makes them happy.


  We know that when we’re happy we smile. But **can smiling make us happy?**


  It turns out, it does.


  And behaving as if we’re not in pain reduces the amount of pain we feel.


  The connection between our actions and emotions is usually thought to be
  one-way: emotions cause actions, including facial expressions.


  Extensive research has revealed that **this connection goes both ways.**
  Behaving as if we feel (or don’t feel) an emotion will cause that genuine
  emotion.


  This is **not psychological trickery,** faking it ’til you make it. Acting as
  if we feel an emotion produces physiological changes.

  ### Influencing Others: Start With Their Actions Instead of Their Thinking


  > "On each occasion, behaving as if believed a certain argument achieves what
  a hundred rational reasons couldn't, quickly changing their attitudes in favor
  of the position they were asked to support."- The As If Principle, page 160


  When we’re responsible for guiding others, in work or in life, we’re
  constantly looking for buy in, for that moment when they believe in what
  they’re doing, and **no longer need external motivation.** We try every
  possible form of persuasion.


  It’s far more effective to simply get them to take action. **Even a small
  action can lead to new thinking.**


  Want employees to sign up for a new program? Spend less time trying to
  convince them. Instead, ask them to pick up the forms, whether they’re
  considering signing up or not.


  **Behaving as if they’re the kind of person who’ll sign up** for the program
  vastly increases the likelihood they will.


  Want your child to keep their room cleaner? Select one area (their dresser, or
  the space in front of their bed) or item (socks, books, blue toys) and ask
  them to manage that.


  **Behaving as if they’re neat** makes it far more likely they’ll become neat.

  ### Your Brain Can Change Your Body


  > "Ekman's findings showed that behaving as if you are experiencing an emotion
  does more than influence how you feel; it also has a direct and powerful
  effect on your body."- The As If Principle, page 18


  When we’re happy, we smile. When we’re angry, our brow constricts and our
  mouth shape changes.


  At the same time, changes take place in our body. Pulse, respiration,
  temperature, perspiration, all change subtly.


  When we act as if we feel a certain emotion, the very same physiological
  changes occur. **A real change is taking place; it’s not all in our head.**


  Taking simple actions can change how we feel, including creating persistence
  and willpower.


  Some examples you can try for yourself:


  *   **Overcoming procrastination** — Act as if you’re going to do the task by
  making a start. Get the supplies you need together. Even if you had no
  intention of doing the task right now, you’ll feel a strong motivation to
  continue.


  *   **Persistence** in the face of a challenge — Sit up straight. Cross your
  arms. In research, those who adopted this pose stuck with a challenging
  problem twice as long.


  *   **Willpower** — Tensing your muscles boosts willpower. When you’re feeling
  tempted, make a fist (and, if you like, shout loudly “You’ll never take me
  alive!” though not if you’re in a library or police station.)
f_conclusion: >-
  Wiseman knows these concepts are highly counter-intuitive. **They’re the
  opposite of what most of us believe.** He includes techniques and experiments
  throughout the book to allow you to prove to yourself that if you want a
  quality, act as if you already have it.
f_quote-2: >-
  "Common sense suggests that the chain of causation is: You feel happy — You
  smile. You feel afraid — You run away. The As If theory suggests that the
  opposite is also true: You smile — You feel happy. You run away — You feel
  afraid."

Modern self-improvement texts universally direct us to **change how we think** in order to change how we behave.

Dr. Richard Wiseman, Britain’s only professor of the Public Understanding of Psychology, shows in _The As If Principle_ that instead, we can focus on actions which will change how we think and feel. We get the same results, only faster and, according to Wiseman’s studies, more consistently and reliably.

**Acting as if we already have a quality will produce it.**

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Acting As If You Feel (Or Don't Feel) Something Will Make It True

> "If you want a quality, act as if you already have it."- William James, quoted in The As If Principle, page vi

Ever heard of a laugh club? People get together and laugh. Not at something or someone. They just laugh.

And it makes them happy.

We know that when we’re happy we smile. But **can smiling make us happy?**

It turns out, it does.

And behaving as if we’re not in pain reduces the amount of pain we feel.

The connection between our actions and emotions is usually thought to be one-way: emotions cause actions, including facial expressions.

Extensive research has revealed that **this connection goes both ways.** Behaving as if we feel (or don’t feel) an emotion will cause that genuine emotion.

This is **not psychological trickery,** faking it ’til you make it. Acting as if we feel an emotion produces physiological changes.
