  ### Why the World is Going Subscription


  > "Call them the Access Generation: a growing cohort of mobile, technically
  savvy young people who value access over assets."- The Automatic Customer,
  page 18


  In recent years Amazon has launched “Amazon Prime” – a subscription based
  perks package that includes free next-day shipping and streaming video on
  demand. The Avis Budget Group purchased Zipcar (a subscription based car
  rental service) in 2013. Apple offers AppleCare – a subscription based support
  service – on all their product sales. Microsoft’s Office360 allows you to
  access the MS Office suite for a low monthly payment. What is it that has some
  of the leaders in their industries moving to subscription based business
  models? In _The Automatic Customer,_ Warrillow points out four factors that
  are contributing to the rise of subscription based businesses:


  1.  The access generation,

  2.  light-switch reliability,

  3.  delicious data, and

  4.  the long tail.


  While each of these is worthy of (and receives) it’s own attention, analysis
  and examples in _The Automatic Customer_, the first one – “The access
  generation” – most captured my attention.


  For many years I owned a Founders Card, an application based, annual
  membership (read: subscription) card that granted me discounts on all sorts of
  things startup founders would find valuable. Recently, I learned about
  “Priority Pass”, a subscription based card that grants you access at the
  exclusive lounges at major airports without having to earn the airline points.
  There’s something attractive about the promise of access, particularly if we
  feel like it has some level of exclusivity to it. The interesting part? I’ve
  actually never paid to access an airport lounge before, but I’d buy the card
  that gives me effectively the same thing. There’s a desire for access – to
  feeling “a part of the club” that is attractive. And, for the right price,
  enticing enough to pull out a credit card.

  ### Tick, tick, tick…


  > "Like surfing, part of getting people to adopt your subscription product or
  service in the first 90 days is to give them a quick win that provides the
  motivation for them to learn more."- The Automatic Customer, page 183


  You know how they say, “it takes 30 days to create a habit”? Well for that
  person that just registered for a trial of your subscription offering, the
  clock just started ticking. According to Warrillow’s research, you have
  roughly 90-days to lock in the behaviors and enthusiasm of your new users.
  Companies like HubSpot and Zendesk understand this, spending considerable
  resources to personally onboard new clients during those first 90 days. The
  easiest way to get your customer hooked? **Give them a quick win.**


  What’s the easiest taste of success that you can help someone achieve when you
  interact with your business for the first time? Are you setting up unnecessary
  barriers for them to reach that milestone? I liked the example John used in
  the book of Constant Contact’s CEO Gail Goodman, who shifted the focus of
  their clients first experience from the frustrating task of uploading existing
  contacts to the fun and creative task of designing their first newsletter
  template.


  The question to ask is, “What’s the enjoyable aspect of using our
  product/service, and how do we help a new client/lead experience that as
  quickly and easily as possible?” Get that right, and you’ve bought yourself
  some more time.

  ### Solve a need


  > "The most profitable membership websites are usually business-to-business
  companies that solve a real problem, offering ‘must have’ information and
  maintaining constantly evolving forums that require that a subscriber stay
  loyal over the long term."- The Automatic Customer, page 55


  Unless you’re locking your clients in to a long term contract (don’t do that),
  any subscription based business runs the risk of being a “flavor of the month”
  experiment for their desired customer. Particularly in a down economy, where
  most people are looking at ways to cut their monthly expenses, monthly hits on
  the credit card can be the first to go. Unless that person needs you. Unless
  you are so essential to the core of their business that pulling the pin on you
  would cause massive headaches for their own business.


  This is one of the advantages of focusing on serving other companies in your
  subscription business. When someone else’s ability to make money relies on
  your service or product, you become very sticky. You become the _last_ thing
  they cut, as opposed to the other “nice to haves” that aren’t truly essential.


  As you think about what your subscription offering could look like, think
  about how deeply you can integrate yourself into your target customers’ habits
  and (ideally) business practices.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Automatic Customer_ is one of those rare books that provides both an
  engrossing read (I polished it off in one four-hour sitting) **and** specific
  and tactical strategies that earn it a “required reading” endorsement for
  anyone considering a subscription model. Warrillow does a great job of weaving
  stories (and in many cases, behind the scenes tours) of popular companies into
  practical advice and “how-tos” on how you, too, can benefit from the rising
  tide of subscription businesses. Highly recommend.

> "Metaphorically speaking, a traditional business requires more brawn, while subscription business requires more brain." _\- The Automatic Customer, page 124_

_The Automatic Customer_ is a book about, and an argument for, subscription-based businesses.

Building off his first book, [_Built to Sell_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/built-to-sell/), author John Warrillow takes this opportunity to deep dive into the world of subscription billing. What makes this book particularly interesting is that John is not simply talking about software-subscriptions (typically referred to as “Software-as-a-Service”, or SaaS), but instead shows how virtually **any** industry has the potential to create a subscription revenue stream that either complements an existing business model or launches a whole new enterprise. And he makes a compelling case.

Divided into three sections, the book first explores _why_ subscription businesses are on the rise, then enters a deeper exploration of 9 common subscription models, before wrapping with an extremely comprehensive review of the new language, metrics and required skills for building a successful subscription-based business.
