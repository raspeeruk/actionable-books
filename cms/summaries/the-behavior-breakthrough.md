  ### Set BRAVO Goals


  > "Senior leaders neglect to identify which of these critical priorities are
  the organization’s BRAVO goals, that is, the top priorities that will require
  significant behavior change."- The Behavior Breakthrough, page 93


  You probably associate the word BRAVO with an audience acknowledging a
  performance done flawlessly, to a high level of excellence. It’s inspiring to
  see an individual or a team execute a difficult task or maneuver with apparent
  ease, because we intuitively know that the task really isn’t easy to do. When
  we shout BRAVO! we acknowledge that there was a lot of hard work and
  determination that went into achieving that level of success.


  For Jacobs and colleagues, BRAVO is an acronym for Behaviorally Reinforced
  Acceleration for Vital Outcomes (sounds like a mad science experiment doesn’t
  it?). Their research has shown that companies that pinpoint one or two high
  impact behaviors and design processes and practices to deliver the right
  consequences for executing the right behaviors well, achieve results faster
  than those who leave performance feedback and consequences to chance. BRAVO
  goals designate the highest priorities of the organization AND signal that
  people will need to alter their current behaviors significantly in order to
  achieve success.


  In a world where we are pulled in multiple directions simultaneously because
  of the many different professional and personal roles we have, the idea of
  setting two or three BRAVO goals appeals to me. It has the potential to
  revolutionize the traditional (and generally meaningless) “New Year’s
  Resolutions” game into something more than just wishful thinking. Imagine the
  success you could achieve if you identified your highest priorities and
  focused your energies on the one or two key behaviors that, if executed and
  rewarded consistently, would guarantee positive results! BRAVO! BRAVO!

  ### Define Your IMPACT


  > "What we reinforce or discourage, intentionally or quite unintentionally,
  makes a difference."- The Behavior Breakthrough, page 215


  IMPACT is another acronym to remind you of the following key coaching
  practices:


  *   **I**dentify and **M**easure desired (business) results

  *   **P**inpoint high-impact behaviors needed to achieve targeted (business)
  results

  *   **A**ctivate and **C**onsequate discretionary performance of desired
  behaviors

  *   **T**ransfer successful approaches to achieve new progress


  In the list above, I inserted brackets around the term (business) because I
  believe the six practices listed apply equally well to personal goals and
  outcomes, and I’m fairly confident the authors would concur. Whether you are
  applying the concepts from this book to your business or your personal life is
  irrelevant; what is relevant is the fact that high performers are deliberate
  in their daily actions.


  Consider the impact the late Steve Jobs had when he returned to Apple in 1997.
  He took a company that, according to Fast Company, was pursing over “15
  product platforms with a zillion variants” and refocused it on four primary
  offerings. In Job’s own words, “We had to decide: What are the fundamental
  directions we are going in? What makes sense and what doesn’t?” A deliberate
  focus on fewer products enabled Apple to have an almost unprecedented impact
  on the technology industry (think iMac, iTunes, the iPod, and iPad) and regain
  its status as a valued brand and market leader.


  We need to have the same courage and vision that Steve Jobs had if we truly
  want to elevate our performance and achieve our BRAVO goals. So, open your
  calendar (yes, right now) and schedule some time to really think about:


  *   What is it that you want to achieve (at work, at home, in your community)?

  *   What do you need to do to become the Steve Jobs of your industry – the
  best version of yourself?

  *   Of all the things you could do to attain that success, what are the one or
  two critical behaviours you need to shift to get better results?

  *   How will you get started? What do you need to put in place to encourage
  and reward those behaviour shifts?


  Then implement, measure, adjust and repeat!

  ### The Magic of Pocket Change


  > "Behavioral leadership focuses on crafting desirable shifts in everyday
  habits, behaviors and routines."- The Behavior Breakthrough, page 4


  Ok, I’m going to assume you are with me and have identified a BRAVO goal or
  two to work on over the coming months. Like New Year’s Resolutions, it’s easy
  to start off with a bang (lots of energy and enthusiasm) and, just as easy to
  ‘fall off the wagon’ three weeks into your behavior change initiative. We’ve
  all “Been there, done that!” right?


  Shifting new behaviors into habits and routines takes time and perseverance.
  Common wisdom suggests we’ll be more likely to stick with it if we reward
  ourselves and celebrate small wins along the way. Here’s a technique that
  captured my attention and one I’m looking forward to testing out, coined
  “Pocket Change” by the authors (pun definitely intended!)


  The concept is simple:


  1.  Think of the behavior you want to shift. In the book, a manager wanted to
  increase the frequency with which he gave his team members positive feedback
  and encouragement, something he found difficult to do.

  2.  Determine the frequency with which the behavior needs to happen (aim for
  daily). Our manager decided he wanted to give his team members positive
  feedback four times each day.

  3.  Put the required number of quarters in your right hand pocket in the
  morning and each time you execute the behavior, shift a quarter to your left
  hand pocket.

  4.  Your goal is to move all your quarters into the left hand pocket by the
  end of the day.


  Within days the manager found it easier to encourage his staff. He had an
  immediate and measureable way to assess his progress and within weeks, his
  team was performing better and enjoying their work more.


  Where might you use this strategy to support your behavior change goals?
f_conclusion: >-
  On page one of _The Behavior Breakthrough_ the authors note, “New results
  require new behaviour. It’s that simple – and that difficult.” Fortunately,
  after reading the book’s 216 pages, I came away with several new ideas on how
  to create my own behavior breakthroughs. In turn, I hope my summary has
  inspired you to pursue a behavior breakthrough of your own! Here’s to our
  future success!

  "Behavioral leadership puts to work the principle that new results require new
  behavior, and significant results – those that confer a broad and significant
  competitive advantage – require the right new behaviors and the right few
  behaviors that endure over time."

Albert Einstein is widely credited with saying “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results”. While there’s absolutely no evidence that Einstein actually made this statement, it’s still a great quote! In _The Behavior Breakthrough_, Steve Jacobs and his colleagues challenge this definition of insanity and actually build a case for improving business outcomes by focusing on identifying and consistently rewarding small but critical employee behaviors that will dramatically improve an organization’s bottom line.
