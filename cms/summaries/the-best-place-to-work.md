  ### Make Your People Your Priority


  > "How much is it costing businesses to leave employee friendships to
  chance?"- The Best Place to Work, page 104


  A wealth of data shows that happy employees are the best employees, and that a
  sense of camaraderie with colleagues is a large factor in everything from
  performance to company pride. Employees with a best friend at work have been
  shown to be more focused and passionate, and they also tend to take fewer sick
  days and change jobs less frequently.


  But proximity alone isn’t always enough to upgrade cubicle neighbors to
  confidantes. Organic friendships are rarely formed over preferred pen brands;
  employers that create ample opportunities for deeper out-of-office sharing
  often promote the strongest employee relationships.


  Bulletin boards or customized introduction emails that allow employees to
  exchange information about their hobbies, families, or their favorite books,
  movies and music, for example, creates a pathway for relationships based on
  deeper traits. Giving employees a budget for celebrating their coworkers’
  birthdays, marriages, and other millstones gives them opportunities to
  celebrate their colleagues as they would outside the office.

  ### Hiring Is Hard. And That’s OK…


  > "No matter how closely we might be attending to a candidate’s abilities, our
  unconscious is ever present, filtering our impressions using an outdated set
  of criteria that have little to do with an applicant’s actual potential."- The
  Best Place to Work, page 229


  No matter how advanced we consider ourselves, many of our decision making
  processes are based on biological drives that are no longer relevant. We can’t
  help but perceive height and attractiveness as indicators of leadership
  ability and overall health and preparedness. We judge strength, integrity and
  power as most present in those with deeper voices, and discount people with
  higher pitched voices as the opposite. People who are similar to us make us
  more comfortable than those who differ from us in background, upbringing or
  experience.


  But we can combat our lizard brains to ensure we’re truly and consciously in
  control of our hiring decisions to attract the most qualified talent and
  assemble a talented, motivated and cohesive team.


  During the hiring process, avoid consuming irrelevant information — viewing
  profile photos, looking up out-of-the-office activities, or conferring with
  other interviewers — ahead of time to limit biased first impressions that
  could unconsciously alter your interview questions. Create opportunities for
  “blinded” filters, like tests, challenges, or other assignments that offer
  unbiased assessments of ability and fit.

  ### Make Room for Creativity (and Failure)


  > "Engaging employees is about creating an environment that positions people
  to do their best work."- The Best Place to Work, page 37


  Few people are able to do their best work in an environment that feels
  restricted, stifled, unforgiving, and the best employers make room for
  employee creativity and the occasional failure that comes with it, both
  physically and culturally.


  An office with a great view, natural light and colors, living plants, or
  outdoor work spaces creates a biologically comfortable environment that
  maximizes productivity and happiness. Tall ceilings increase creativity and
  high-level thinking. Comfortable seating and round conference rooms and tables
  foster more collaboration than rigid chairs in spaces with hard edges and
  oppositional positions. Reorganizing offices and desks so that employees don’t
  have their backs to open areas reduces the feelings of vulnerability and
  tension that are hardwired into our caveman brains.


  But if an office upgrade isn’t in the cards, there are cultural changes that
  can be made from the top down too. Transparency and admitting faults without
  shame creates an openness that fosters more of the same. Creating an award for
  the biggest risk or the most out-of-the-box idea shows that your organization
  values innovation.
f_conclusion: >-
  As Friedman says, “there’s no one right way of operating an organization,” but
  _The Best Place To Work_ provides a fascinating and scientifically-supported
  framework for managers and new employees alike to help create a productive and
  engaged workforce from the inside out, in whatever ways make sense for them.

> "The secret to happy workplaces isn’t spending more money. It’s about creating the conditions that allow employees to do their best work." _\- The Best Place to Work, page xviii_

A globalized world of opportunities, a new generation of digital-native workers, and a few high-profile examples of “Fun-First” office spaces have left companies trying to “out-perk” the competition in order to woo the most sought-after applicants. But putting a Ping-Pong table in the break room isn’t enough to keep top talent on your team.

In _The Best Place To Work: The Art and Science of Creating an Extraordinary Workplace_, Ron Friedman creates an easily digestible meta-analysis of recent research on the policies, perks, structures, and more that create the most collaborative, productive, happy and proud employees.

Far from a prescriptive “one-size-fits-all” approach, this book presents a wealth of research supporting each of the many possible opportunities for improvement in the workplace and offers a number of different solutions that are in line with that research. Friedman gives each area of workplace optimization its own chapter, and ends each chapter with two clear sets of action steps — one for managers and one for employees. Whether you’re a new employee or a seasoned executive, this book will offer you inspiration and next steps to help turn your office into “The Best Place To Work.”
