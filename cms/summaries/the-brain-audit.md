  ### Start With the Process


  > "The Brain Audit is a language the brain understands. It’s not a language of
  persuasion. Or coercion. It doesn’t psyche the customer into buying against
  his or her will. It’s simple a language the brain understands and responds
  to."- The Brain Audit, page xvii


  Selling has a complexity to it. The buyer goes through several steps, many of
  them subconscious, before they get to the point where they say, “Yes, I want
  that.” Knowing the psychology behind this, salespeople can build an approach
  that follows and support the buyer’s process.


  D’Souza suggests the following sequence that salespeople should follow:


  1\. Identify The Problem  

  2\. Present A Solution  

  3\. Define The Target Profile  

  4\. Handle Objections  

  5\. Collect Testimonials  

  6\. The Risk Reversal  

  7\. Establish Your Uniqueness


  I wish I had room to discuss each on in-depth, but that’s not the case. But
  looking at the list, it’s easy to see where salespeople get off track. For
  starters, many salespeople are passionate about their product and their
  company. They believe in what they sell and the value they create. So much so,
  they like to start the conversation talking about themselves, their solution.
  They list features and benefits. They talk about promotions and deals. But
  that doesn’t work unless you’ve identified the problem. People spend money to
  fix problems – to eliminate pain or create gain. Simple as that. **Until you
  understand what _the customer_ wants to achieve, it’s hard to achieve what
  _you_ want**.


  Let’s look at two of these sections in more depth.

  ### Be Remarkable or Be Forgotten


  > "If you’re customer can’t tell you the uniqueness of your brand in a
  millisecond, then either you don’t have a uniqueness, or you’ve failed to make
  your uniqueness well known."- The Brain Audit, page 126


  As the barriers to entry in virtually every market and every industry get
  smaller, the ability to identify and communicate what makes you unique, what
  makes you special, and worth paying attention to is arguably the most
  important thing every business and salesperson needs to establish.


  D’Souza says there are two things a business or salesperson must do to
  accomplish establishing their uniqueness or point of differentiation.


  First you have to choose something that really is unique. If someone else can
  make the same claim, you haven’t succeeded. If someone else can easily copy
  what you do, that won’t work either. Being unique requires focus, discipline,
  and commitment.


  And second you have to choose one thing. Not two, not three, but one single
  characteristic, one feature, one skill that you want to be known for and
  highlight it like crazy. It’s tempting to want to talk about everything you do
  all the time. And while those things may be important and relevant in specific
  situations, you need to establish the one thing that makes you different.


  You can see how major brands have done this. Volvo cars have plenty of
  features, but they are known for one thing – safety. Walmart sells a lot of
  things, but they are known for one thing – low prices.

  ### The Strategic Testimonial


  > "What if you had a more believable testimonial? A testimonial that not only
  shows us the ‘after’ scenario, but reveals the ‘before’ as well. A testimonial
  with the complete picture."- The Brain Audit, page 87


  Everyone in sales understands the value of a testimonial. But this book has
  completely changed how I will go about collecting them in the future. One of
  the problems with testimonials is they are “too sugary.” They are filled with
  lavish praise, making customers skeptical about them in the first place.


  D’Souza says there is a specific “construction” that makes testimonials far
  more effective. “When you use structure, you don’t get random testimonials,
  but instead you get testimonials that are specific and story-like.”


  The key word is story. Testimonials that work tell a story.


  *   **They share the concerns and hesitation someone had before buying**: “I
  was concerned about the technology or I wasn’t sure it would be worth the
  investment.”

  *   **They talk about what happened as a result of buying**: “The return on
  investment was almost immediate.”

  *   **They highlight a specific feature or benefit**: “The software helped
  identify new opportunities for growth.”

  *   **They list additional benefits**: “I’m a more confident, more energized,
  more knowledgeable business owner.”

  *   **They make a recommendation**: “If you’re looking for ways to build a
  stronger, more credible online presence, ABC Company can help.”


  With this format as a guideline, you can now begin to coach customers on how
  to structure their testimonials in the future.
f_conclusion: >-
  Very few absolutes exist in sales and marketing, and almost no guarantees.
  You’re dealing with individuals who have specific needs, different
  motivations, and different triggers. This means that no process works 100% of
  the time. It will, however, help you to position your product more effectively
  and identify which areas you need to make changes or modifications to.

  They obviously like what you’re selling, but they shift, fidget, and
  inexplicably walk away. And your sure sale slips through your fingers
  forever."

> "You’ve done everything to get \[the customer\] interested and ready to buy. They obviously like what you’re selling, but they shift, fidget, and inexplicably walk away. And your sure sale slips through your fingers forever." _\- The Brain Audit, back cover_

In the last several years, selling has really changed. That’s true whether you sell business to business, business to customer, online or in person. Consumers today are more informed, more connected, and more empowered. It’s not unusual that they know more about your product than you. Disruption is a trendy word right now in business. And to say the least, this trend has been very disruptive to salespeople everywhere.

Amidst all this change, it can be very tempting to make drastic changes to the way you sell or the way you position yourself. And while there are definitely times to do so, there are some basic and fundamental selling skills that still make up the foundation of building relationships, establishing trust, and making sales. Sean D’Souza does a great job of reminding us of what those fundamentals are in his book, _The Brain Audit._

Having spent nearly my entire professional life in sales, I was eager to get my hands on this book based on a recommendation from a colleague. It’s an easy read packed with some great information. Today, more than ever, it’s really the buying process that’s undergoing a dramatic shift and D’Souza helps the reader understand the psychology of the consumer.
