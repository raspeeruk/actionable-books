  ### The Great Convergence


  > "The zeitgeist shift, The Great Convergence, makes it possible to envision
  an entire reboot of capitalism in a way that lifts people up, solves problems,
  and promotes lasting change. It’s called Capitalism 2.0, and its engine is
  social entrepreneurship."- The Business of Good, location 608


  Haber shares that social entrepreneurship has grown, since 9/11, at an
  astonishing pace. He attributes this to what he calls “The Great Convergence.”
  What is converging? A shrinking world (we now more and are more connected) and
  a troubled world (facing new and daunting challenges) are creating a higher
  level of awareness—and rewriting the “rules for how society lives, works and
  plays.”


  The mix of entrepreneurship with a desire to make a difference creates an
  opportunity for profits and purpose to co-exist, rather than live in conflict.
  And, perhaps even more importantly, social entrepreneurship is a means which
  “private sector actors solve public and private sector problems that are not
  being addressed.”


  What I read in Haber’s book—and saw at Echoing Green—is that behind each
  social entrepreneur is a “bold idea”—a way of articulating a challenge in a
  new way and bringing in a new type of solution that engages and empowers all
  stakeholders, including consumers.


  This is summarized beautifully in a quote from Bill Drayton of Ashoka (another
  organization that supports social entrepreneurs:) “Social entrepreneurs are
  not content just to give a fish or teach how to fish. They will not rest until
  they have revolutionized the fishing industry.”

  ### Measurement Matters


  > "Today there is a new group of philanthropists who are redefining what it
  means to give. In fact, they aren’t really “giving.” Instead, they are
  Kickstarters of social enterprise. Just like with the crowdfunding platform,
  those putting money in expect something in return."- The Business of Good,
  location 1671


  Haber outlines a myriad of large and small foundations and philanthropists who
  are giving to support innovative social entrepreneurs—working in both the
  for-profit and non-profit sectors. This new band of investors is like
  traditional investors in that they need to see a return on their investment.
  The difference is that this return is measured in different ways. Impact
  investing can focus on the enterprise (the business) or the person (the
  talent)—there are successful examples of both.


  The importance of measurement of impact cannot be understated. When measures
  are not as straightforward as profit, the ability to identify the desired
  impact and to be able to report on it is enormous. d.light’s ability to
  measure and tell its story is critical to its success. Measurement also is
  critical when experiments fail—enabling the experimenters to tweak their
  strategies, and to re-group and try again—while continuing to garner
  investment.


  Measurement is another area where a social entrepreneurial mindset differs
  from a traditional non-profit mindset. When I was with the Echoing Green
  fellows I noticed that, to a person, when asked what their work was they
  talked about the bold idea (an innovative solution to a social challenge) and
  the way they would know if they addressed it. That was the essence of the
  elevator speech. Haber successfully demonstrates why this matters so deeply.

  ### The Base of the Pyramid as a Market


  > "The approach of the social entrepreneur is new. It requires challenging the
  status quo. Instead of looking to the poor as a group to be pitied, social
  entrepreneurs view them as a market where goods and services can benefit both
  parties."- The Business of Good, location 789


  Truth be told, the above quote challenged me at first. Isn’t this still
  manipulation? Here’s the thing: Inherent in social entrepreneurial ventures is
  a deep shift in our understanding of the power and voice of those who sit at
  the so-called Base or Bottom of the Pyramid.


  First—terminology: The BoP generally refers to those four billion or so people
  who live on less than $1500 per year. And, while social entrepreneurial
  ventures are not limited to this population, it is a primary focus. Viewing
  this population as one that has voice and can be a responsible consumer is a
  significant and powerful shift. Haber draws on the work of CK Prahalad, who
  wrote [_The Fortune at the Bottom of the
  Pyramid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fortune_at_the_Bottom_of_the_Pyramid)_._


  While there’s far more to it than can be covered here, suffice it to say that
  Prahalad’s proposal to reach this population presents a new way of thinking
  about how we operate a business. His four A’s are: awareness, access,
  affordable and available. This approach is respectful of the shared dignity of
  all people and recognizes that people need more than handouts. What is most
  needed is the opportunity to generate revenue and use that revenue to buy
  products that create lives that are more sustainable.


  Haber shares a powerful example. d.light brought durable, powerful and
  beautifully designed solar lanterns to market, reducing the cost for consumers
  (vs. kerosene) and creating a healthy alternative. They now have 51 million
  customers in 60 countries—with a goal of reaching 100 million by 2020.


  Scale is powerful. When products are sold at very low margins (which is almost
  always the case,) volume becomes essential. The ability to generate volume
  becomes a powerful challenge for social entrepreneurs—without scale, success
  is very difficult.
f_conclusion: >-
  The Business of Good is full of compelling, inspiring stories. You will need
  to read the book to hear those stories—and I think you’ll enjoy it. Haber’s
  very readable book helps you feel a little better about the good we can do and
  the possibilities for making the world a better place.

  "We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with
  the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history,
  there “is” such a thing as being too late. This is no time for apathy or
  complacency. This is a time for vigorous and positive action."

I had the fortune to read this book while attending the all-fellow’s conference of Echoing Green—a non-profit that funds social entrepreneurs across the globe who are working at the intersection of social justice and social innovation. If I hadn’t been at the Echoing Green conference, working directly with a group of social entrepreneurs, I probably would have been a great deal more skeptical than I am about Haber’s book.

Reading this book (and attending the conference) at the close of the 2016 election season in the United States, when many are feeling unsure about where we are headed, was a perfect choice. Jason Haber paints a positive, glass 3/4 full picture of the power of business to do good in the world—full of stories of people and businesses charting new territory in making a difference. This is not a how-to book, for that you’ll need to look elsewhere—however, there are some actionable gems to be found—and tons of inspiration.
