  ### You Get Rich by Having Your Money do the Work


  > "Working hard at making money will never create wealth."- The Business of
  the 21st Century, page 28


  Earning a regular wage will get the average person by from day to day, week to
  week, but will not continue to pay after wage-earning work stops. Wages only
  come as long as you work. The same is true when you work for yourself. The
  minute checks stop coming from clients, the self-employed person stops
  earning.


  Only when you get your money working for you do you cease having to work for
  wages every day. Of course you need money in the first place in order for it
  to be able to work for you. This is the catch 22 that most people face. They
  have skills to work and earn enough money to survive; what they don’t have is
  enough earning potential to provide sufficient excess money that can be
  invested and start working for you.


  In the first gem of this book, we will look at Kiyosaki’s model for four
  earning quadrants. In order to get your money working for you effectively, you
  need to own a large business or have large investments, primarily in real
  estate. Now, unless you have enough money to invest in real estate, it’s not a
  good starting option. That leaves owning a large business, where large is
  defined as having approx. 500+ people working for you.


  Some people, with the right idea or product, manage to build, through hard
  work and good luck, a big business—which eventually allows them to start
  investing money coming out of the business in ways that the money begins to
  earn more money. Unfortunately, for every business that succeeds from the
  ground up, there are many that fail. The failures can come from bad timing,
  bad luck, too small a market share for the offering, or many other reasons.
  The bottom line is that it’s tough to succeed at building a large business
  from the ground up.


  So far, the odds of success sound long. There is an alternative that the book
  provides which allows anyone to start a large business with little investment,
  no great product or idea, and do it in an environment where everyone has a
  vested interest in your success. The authors are referring to Network
  Marketing. There is an important difference to their approach to Network
  Marketing then you’ve probably heard in the past. Many people believe that
  they need to be constantly be selling the product offerings of the Network
  Marketing company headquarters. In truth, what you need to spend most of your
  time doing is selling others on the idea of signing up under you, so they can
  grow businesses that will pay dividends to you. Grow your own network as wide
  and deep as you can. Teach your downstream how to sell the products and the
  network. Help them build as wide and deep as they can. Ensure orders are
  processed in a timely manner, and cash flows back as quickly. That, in a
  nutshell, is how to build a big business from nothing in the 21st century.

  ### The Value of Networking


  > "As a network marketer, you might think your job is to demonstrate and sell
  a product. It’s not. Your job is to communicate information, to tell a great
  story, and build a network."- The Business of the 21st Century, page 63


  If you choose to pursue a Network Marketing opportunity, who you know, and who
  they know, will become important to you. You will need to sell the opportunity
  to many people in order to build a successful business. While it is possible
  to connect to strangers and have them become successful parts of your
  business, it is more work to connect to them than to connect to people you
  already know – your network of contacts.


  You need to know people to make this succeed. Not everyone in your network
  needs to be a close friend, but you have to comfortable approaching them with
  a business proposition and they have to be willing to give your proposition a
  fair listen. The wider and well-tended your network, the easier it is to find
  enough people you can bring into your company and set everyone up for success.

  ### The Four Categories of Work


  > "But even more important than the quantity of money you make is the quality
  of the money you make. In other words it isn’t just how much you make, but how
  you make it, where it comes from."- The Business of the 21st Century, page 15


  ![](/assets/external/65d78bbd9d5cbf511bd7a8a5_wealth-quadrants.png)


  Robert Kiyosaki has, in previous books, resented this quadrant diagram for how
  wealth is earned. He is quick to point out that you do not want to be in the
  left half if you want to build sufficient wealth to become independent.
  Earning a wage from a company only earns you money when you actually work. The
  same is true of the self-employed.


  Only when you are running a large business or managing large investments do
  you have money earned for you by others. Only in the right-hand quadrants do
  you have freedom to control your life without concern for the next paycheque.

  The book is not a long or complex read. It is very to the point and delivers
  without much extraneous content, not only the thesis of the book but also
  provides concrete advice on how to make it happen. Then they go on to give
  concrete advice on how to invest money as it comes in:

> "Most of the U.S. population has been living for years on the knife-edge precipice between solvency and ruin." _\- The Business of the 21st Century, page 3_

Written by Robert Kiyosaki, the author of [_Rich Dad, Poor Dad_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/rich-dad-poor-dad/), _The Business of the 21st Century_ is a look at what wealth is, how it affects your future, and a method for how to achieve it.

Kiyosaki, with his wife Kim Kiyosaki, and business associate John Fleming, provide information on how business has changed significantly in recent times. The days of a single career for life, ending in a comfortable retirement are largely gone. A lifetime of work across several different jobs will leave many people with a retirement of poverty.

Kiyosaki _et al_ then go on to talk about a way to succeed financially despite all the challenges of the current business environment. They discuss how the business model works and how to succeed at it, including different options for how to enter, and how to succeed.
