  ### One, two, three, four... Five!


  > "The five profiles are statistically derived, but they accurately and
  completely describe the five most common profiles found in the real world."-
  The Challenger Sale, page 19


  After a massive and sophisticated statistical analysis, Dixon and Adamson
  discovered that every sales rep falls into one of five distinct profiles.
  Think of reps you know. Do you know these types?


  1) The Hard Worker


  *   Always willing to go the extra mile

  *   Doesn’t give up easily

  *   Self-motivated

  *   Interested in feedback and development


  2) The Challenger


  *   Always has a different view of the world

  *   Understands the customer’s business

  *   Loves to debate

  *   Pushes the customer


  3) The Relationship Builder


  *   Builds strong advocates in customer organization

  *   Generous in giving time to help others

  *   Gets along with everyone


  4) The Lone Wolf


  *   Follows own instincts

  *   Self-assured

  *   Difficult to control


  5) The Reactive Problem Solver


  *   Reliably responds to internal and external stakeholders

  *   Ensures that all problems are solved

  *   Detail-oriented


  Which category do you think houses the most successful reps? Well, maybe the
  title of the book gave it away but yes, the Challenger. Shock of all shock, it
  was not the relationship builder that we had put our bets on for so long. They
  were the loser category!

  ### What makes the rock stars rock?


  > "When you ask people to compare their rock stars with their losers, you find
  that they can dissect the losers with surgical precision but find it hard, if
  not impossible, to put their finger on exactly what makes their rock stars
  rock."- The Challenger Sale, page xiii


  So let’s capture a clear picture of what this ideal Challenger rep does. The
  three pillars that make a Challenger is their ability to teach, tailor, and
  take control.


  They outperform their colleagues in the following attributes:


  *   Offer the customer unique perspectives

  *   Have strong two-way communication skills

  *   Know the individual customer’s value drivers

  *   Can identify economic drivers of the customer’s business

  *   Are comfortable discussing money

  *   Can pressure the customer


  The traditional rep is busy telling endless facts and features and resolving
  tension while the challenger rep creates constructive tension with unique
  insights tailored to the customer’s specific needs and objectives.


  Challenger reps are successful because they teach – or reframe how the
  customer sees things. They create a disorienting dilemma that moves the
  customers out of their comfort zone and pushes them to see things in a
  different light.

  ### One clear winner and one clear loser


  > "In our study, only 7 percent of all star performers fell into the
  Relationship Builder profile, far fewer than any other. And this finding
  should be a real red flag for all sales leaders encouraging their reps to
  simply go out and ‘build deeper relationships’ with customers."- The
  Challenger Sale, page 24


  Have you ever heard a senior Sales Director say “It all boils down to the
  relationship”? And people nod in agreement. After all, who are they to argue?


  But maybe after reading _The Challenger Sale_ they would!


  Conventional wisdom has long held that in complex sales, relationships are the
  basis of all sales success. Over the last ten years however there has been a
  flip-flop. Customer relationship is the result and not the cause of successful
  selling. I hear reps say all the time “I have such a great relationship with
  him but he just won’t use my product!” That’s because customers today are
  likely to say “I have a great relationship with her but her competition
  delivers better value so I buy from them.”


  Reps traditionally have felt they are there to serve and support their
  customers. Their goal was to keep things friendly, and not rock the boat. The
  research presented here suggests that customers are looking to suppliers to
  challenge their thinking and bring new ideas to address their toughest
  problems in ways they would not have thought of on their own.
f_conclusion: >-
  So what do you need to do? Reframe the goal of the rep. They should be making
  their customers think, bring new ideas and find creative and innovative ways
  to help the customer win. It’s time to rethink how we sell (especially in the
  complex sale) and Dixon and Adamson have some excellent food for thought –
  pushing the average rep out of their comfort zone to a success zone! There’s a
  lot to learn here. If you are a sales rep or manage reps, I highly recommend
  you roll up your sleeves and dive into this great read!

Wouldn’t it be great if you could bottle what your best sales reps do and sprinkle it over all the rest? In the quest to do just that by understanding what top-performing sales reps do, Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson, authors of _The Challenger Sale_, performed an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps and discovered something that is shaking the ground as a breakthrough!

They dethroned traditional beliefs and identified specifically who the stars are and what they do differently than the others. You may be surprised!
