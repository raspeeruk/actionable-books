  ### Employ Your Charisma Behaviors


  > "Contrary to commonly held charisma myths, you don’t have to be naturally
  outgoing, you don’t have to be physically attractive, and you won’t have to
  change your personality. No matter where you’re starting from, you can
  significantly increase your personal charisma and reap the rewards both in
  business and in daily life."- The Charisma Myth, pages 9-10


  Does charisma magically happen? The simple answer is “no.” It takes effort,
  but is attainable by all, so long as we can understand and learn to focus on
  three key behaviors: **presence**, **power**, and **warmth**. These three
  behaviors need to flow together in order to make the most of our charisma.


  It starts with presence. We need to be fully present with others for our
  charisma to really work. In the age of distraction, we can easily be listening
  while not _really_ listening. Our mind begins to wander, and our attention
  dissipates. With imperfect presence, we lose the people around us as they feel
  our lack of care.


  People want to feel that they have our full attention when they speak with us.
  Helping them feel that way will draw them into us. In other words, when we are
  fully present, we create a memorable moment for those immediately around us.


  Power and warmth are added in and tightly bound together. Only both can enable
  our charisma. While warmth is our goodwill towards another, power is our
  ability to make things happen. Being powerful with no warmth will not
  translate into having charisma; it may be viewed as just arrogance. Power and
  warmth provide the balance to enable our charisma to appear with the right mix
  of behaviors.


  Our minds and bodies play key roles in our presence, power, and warmth. Our
  minds create the state in which we operate. With the right mindset, our body
  language aligns and works in concert with all our behaviors. It is about being
  in sync inside and out so that our charisma is felt and experienced.


  Charisma sounds simple then, right? Unfortunately, there are many things that
  get in the way and diminish it. Our presence, power, and warmth can easily be
  distracted and disjointed, and it is only through our awareness and practices
  that our charisma can be revealed and properly used.


  _The Charisma Myth_ delivers important insights and lessons that open the door
  to our capabilities – eliminating the roadblocks and empowering our ability to
  lead more effectively and successfully. The following Insights offer two
  examples of how to utilize your untapped charisma.

  ### Be Self Compassionate


  > "When things go wrong in our lives, it’s easy to feel that other people are
  having an easier time. Recognizing instead that everyone at some point has had
  or will have the very experience you’re having now can help you feel like part
  of the larger human experience rather than feeling isolated and alienated."-
  The Charisma Myth, page 86


  It is not about self-pity. It is about acknowledging what has happened to you
  as “unfortunate”. In doing this, we forgive ourselves, and we don’t get
  wrapped up in being overly self-critical. What happens then is our charisma
  does not become worn down. In fact, self-compassion can create more
  self-confidence and connectedness to a situation, which enhances our charisma.
  A win-win.


  In understanding our charisma, it may be more essential to understand what is
  holding our charisma back. This makes sense. Our mental state needs to be open
  and enabling. With this, our presence, power, and warmth will shine through in
  our interaction with others. Said another way, when we remove our
  self-installed roadblocks, our charisma excels.

  ### Engage Your Discomfort


  > "Imagine strolling along the paths of your mind. Suddenly, you notice an
  unpleasant thought. See it as graffiti on the wall. That’s all it is, graffiti
  – not a verdict on what kind of person you are."- The Charisma Myth, page 49


  What often gets in the way of using our charisma is discomfort and negativity.
  Some of this is self-inflicted, and some is inflicted upon us. In either case,
  there are ways to move beyond the discomfort. It takes effort and focus.


  Two examples of how to engage our discomfort are (1) re-writing reality and
  (2) writing letters.


  **Example 1.** Reality strikes. We get stuck in traffic. We encounter
  something that raises our anger or some other negative emotion, which impacts
  our presence, power, and warmth. In other words, it curtails our charisma.


  To move beyond this discomfort, we can re-write the reality. What if the
  unfortunate, unpleasant experience was the right thing to have happened? Use
  your imagination and write it down. For example, being delayed in traffic
  could have saved your life from having an accident if you could have sped
  forward freely. Take a few minutes and literally write down how the negative
  things could actually be a positive. By writing it down, our mentality shifts
  and the discomfort lifts. We re-gain access to our presence, power, and
  warmth. Our charisma remains intact.


  **Example 2.** To move beyond negativity, we can write a letter and release
  it. Resentment is a powerful uncharismatic mental state, so we need to rid
  ourselves of it. The exercise is to think about the person who really has
  irritated us and write that person a letter communicating everything you
  really want to tell them. Write it out by hand. After this, take out another
  piece of paper and write their response back.


  It sounds awkward, yet it lifts the burden and frees our charisma to shine
  through. It is not about suppressing the discomfort; it is about diving into
  it and releasing it.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Charisma Myth_ delivers an interesting perspective. It lifts any mystery
  surrounding charisma and shows several ways to let our charisma come through
  in an effective and complete manner. As Olivia Fox Cabane states near the end
  of her book: “Now you know what charisma is: behaviors that project presence,
  power, and warmth. You know these behaviors can be learned, and you’ve been
  given an entire toolkit to do so.”
f_quote-2: >-
  "Charisma gets people to like you, trust you, and want to be led by you. It
  can determine whether you’re seen as a follower or a leader, whether your
  ideas get adopted, and how effectively your projects are implemented."
