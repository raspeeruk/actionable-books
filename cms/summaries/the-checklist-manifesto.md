  ### Why We Fail


  > "If the knowledge exists and is not applied correctly, it is difficult not
  to be infuriated."- The Checklist Manifesto, page 11


  Today, more than at any other time in human history, much of the workforce are
  “knowledge workers”—people working in jobs that involve using information to
  make decisions. Given this, people have to continuously know more and learn
  more if they want to succeed and thrive.


  Gawande starts off by addressing that it’s unrealistic for people to know
  and/or understand everything they’re supposed to know at all times and in all
  situations. “The volume and complexity of what we know has exceeded our
  individual ability to deliver its benefits correctly, safely, or reliably.
  Knowledge has both saved us and burdened us.” And while no one is perfect, it
  doesn’t mean that if a mistake is made that it wasn’t avoidable. Gawande
  shares the two main reasons that failure occurs:


  *   **Ignorance** – “we may err because science has given us only a partial
  understanding of the world and how it works.”

  *   **Ineptitude** – “in these instances the knowledge exists, yet we fail to
  apply it correctly.”


  Think about where both apply in your life. The challenge we now face is
  ensuring that the knowledge that we do have is applied consistently and
  correctly, which is where a checklist can be of great value.

  ### When You’re Making a Checklist


  > "When you’re making a checklist---you must define a clear pause point at
  which the checklist is supposed to be used."- The Checklist Manifesto, page
  123


  Throughout the book the author refers to the term “pause points”. These are
  points in any process where there’s a natural pause in the action before doing
  a job. This is where and when a checklist can be best leveraged. During these
  “pauses” there are typically two types of checklists that are used and they
  are do-confirm checklists and read-do checklists. They are defined as:


  *   **Do-confirm checklist** — “team members pause to run the check-list and
  confirm that everything that was supposed to be done was done.”

  *   **Read-do checklist** — “people carry out the task as they check them
  off—it’s more like a recipe.”


  Per insight #1, depending on the problem or situation that the checklist is
  being used for, either type of checklist could be leveraged.


  Gawande touches on some additional guidelines for creating effective
  checklists, which I want to quickly cover. The checklist cannot be lengthy
  (rule of thumb: keep between 5-9 items) and needs to take between 60-90 secs
  to run through. Perhaps the most important piece after a checklist is
  developed is for it to be tested in the real world. From there it should be
  tweaked and modified until it fits the need it’s intended to serve.

  ### The Checklist and Solving Problems


  > "Checklists seem able to defend anyone, even the experienced, against
  failure in many more tasks than we realized. They provide a cognitive net.
  They catch mental flaws inherent in all of us—flaws of memory and attention
  and thoroughness."- The Checklist Manifesto, page 48


  In Gawande’s research, he came across two professors who studied the science
  of complexity, which highlighted three types of problems in the world: the
  simple, the complicated and the complex. They are defined as:


  *   **Simple Problems** – “are ones like baking a cake from a mix. There is a
  recipe. Sometimes there are a few basic techniques to learn. But once these
  are mastered, following the recipe brings a high likelihood of success.”

  *   **Complicated Problems** – “are the ones like sending a rocket to the
  moon. They can sometimes be broken down into a series of simple problems. But
  there is no straightforward recipe. Success frequently requires multiple
  people, often multiple teams and specialized expertise. Unanticipated
  difficulties are frequent. Timing and coordination become serious concerns.”

  *   **Complex Problems** – “are ones like raising a child. Once you learn how
  to send a rocket to the moon, you can repeat the process with other rockets
  and perfect it. One rocket is like another rocket. But not so with raising a
  child. Every child is unique. Although raising one child may provide
  experience, it does not guarantee success with the next child. Expertise is
  valuable but most certainly not sufficient. Indeed, the next child may require
  an entirely different approach from the previous one. And this brings up
  another feature of complex problems: their outcomes remain highly uncertain.
  Yet we all know that it is possible to raise a child well.”


  In each of these problems, checklists can provide direction and protection
  against elementary errors in the process. As you’ll see in insight #2, it is
  important to determine which type of problem you’re looking to solve or
  address when considering how a checklist can help achieve the outcome that
  you’re after.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Checklist Manifesto_ is an engaging read that examines a simple tool
  which has been proven to produce remarkable results. The job of a checklist is
  simply to help eliminate errors and things that we have control over. Given
  the complexity of our jobs (no matter what field we’re in) we can all learn to
  leverage this simple tool. I’d encourage you to examine how you can
  incorporate checklist into your personal and professional lives.

> "Using a checklist—you improve the outcomes with no increase in skill. That’s what we are doing when we use the checklist." _\- The Checklist Manifesto, page 168_

In _The Checklist Manifesto_, author Atul Gawande, MD, MPH, explores how the use of a simple checklist can help eliminate errors in even the most complex jobs and industries. Gawande is a surgeon, writer, and public health researcher who began studying the effectiveness of checklists’ through his work at World Health Organization.

Gawande begins the book by asking the question, why is it that top professionals today, who are better educated and better trained than at any point in human history, still make simple, avoidable mistakes? Mistakes that waste huge amounts of money and even cost lives.

As Gawande set out to find a better way to fix these errors, he met with professionals in healthcare, aviation, and construction to learn how they are leveraging checklists to drastically avoid controllable mistakes. Throughout the book, Gawande shares with us real-life examples of how these complex jobs leverage checklists to achieve success.
