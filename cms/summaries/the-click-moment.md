  ### Success in most fields is random


  > "Your chances of success actually drop when you analyze the market and try
  to predict how to succeed. Because logic led you to conclude that path would
  be reliably successful, others will conclude the same thing and competition
  will be fierce."- The Click Moment, page 52


  This point is about a paradigm shift. There are a number of models that people
  have for how to be successful. One of the older models is based on a notion of
  innate talent. However, while there certainly are genetic predispositions to
  certain skills or fields, it has become clear that our behaviour matters a lot
  more. In particular, the 10,000 hours/deliberate practice paradigm has
  recently started to supercede the talent model, after Malcolm Gladwell
  promoted the research of psychologist K. Anders Ericsson in his book
  [_Outliers_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/outliers/). But, _The
  Click Moment_ says that this kind of success strategy holds true for
  remarkably few fields.


  Why can tennis player Serena Williams, or chess player Susan Polgar, or
  cellist Yo-Yo Ma, succeed predictably after tens of thousands of hours, while
  pop artists, game developers, and product designers succeed much earlier in
  their careers? The former, Johansson argues, are “playing the same game over
  and over again. But the rest of us are playing in a world that is constantly
  changing and adapting through market forces. In one world, the rules of the
  game have remained static for decades or even hundreds of years. In the other,
  the rules of the game change all the time.”


  Once this has been pointed out, it becomes quite obvious that when the rules
  that govern success are no longer predictable, the old strategy of practicing
  the same moves until you achieve “mastery” is **not going to work**. But what
  does work? That’s what the rest of the book, and the following two Insights
  are about.

  ### Indulge curiosity and enhance intersectional thinking


  > "'I am just not as likely to learn all that many new things by simply
  staying within the field I know best,' she said. 'The other conference
  attendees have pretty much the same experiences, history, and worldview as I
  do.'"- The Click Moment, page 128


  The book describes a number of ways to do this, from finding the intersections
  of two different cultures that you’re familiar with, to designing your
  workplace to increase the interactions between members of different teams or
  people with different kinds of perspectives.


  The one that most excited me was “crash a conference or gathering.” I made a
  note of this, and then shortly thereafter I went to my university’s events
  directory and tried to find events that interested me from all of the
  different faculties, so that I could become exposed to ideas that my peers and
  classmates weren’t, and to meet new people in diverse fields. Unfortunately,
  the site was poorly organized, so I wasn’t really able to do this effectively,
  but I think the strategy makes sense.


  Why not take 3 minutes right now ([set a
  timer!](http://e.ggtimer.com/3%20minutes)) and try to make a list of as many
  places as you can think of where you might find event listings that you
  otherwise would have missed. Magazines? Flyers? Well-connected friends in
  different fields?


  Then, set aside some time later to look through those lists, find some
  specific events, and put them into your calendar. Of course, be careful not to
  end up with too many, as explained in insight #1.

  ### Make time for serendipity


  > "In fact, ask yourself with some frequency: considering my current schedule,
  is it even possible for something unscripted or unplanned to happen? And if
  \[it does\], do I have the ability to do anything about it?"- The Click
  Moment, page 120


  Johansson cites some research from Richard Wiseman, author of [_The Luck
  Factor_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-luck-factor/), who has
  discovered that it can actually make sense to talk about certain people as
  being “lucky” or “unlucky” even though there is no cosmic force dishing out
  luck. What luck consists of, by this model, is essentially opportunism: being
  able to spot and take advantage of serendipitous opportunities that emerge
  from the randomness that is life.


  Now, this is Actionable Books, so how do you actually do this?


  Well, in order to be able to notice and take advantage of opportunities, you
  need to have the space to feel comfortable doing so. There are several ways to
  do this:


  *   leave space between meetings

  *   leave extra time in your schedule when travelling

  *   do some of your work in public/social spaces


  Do any of these sound promising to you? It can be hard to do this, since the
  time pressures close in. And yet, _unless you’re a tennis player or a
  cellist,_ in the long term these chance opportunities contribute more to your
  success than one extra meeting crammed in the middle of your day. Most of the
  time the opportunities contribute very little, but without them it’s really
  hard to get a breakthrough, which means that your career will likely become
  stagnant.
f_conclusion: >-
  So, if you’re playing a game with static rules, you want to practice for
  10,000 hours. But in arenas where luck plays a larger role, why not just start
  by following your curiosity, practicing for [the first 20
  hours](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-first-20-hours/) and then
  throwing yourself in and trying to make an impact?

> "While on stage, he was asked what, exactly, he had done to create such a success. \[He\] hesitated for a bit before simply saying, 'If I knew that, I would do it again and again.'" _\- The Click Moment, page 11_

_The Click Moment_ was written by [Frans Johansson](https://www.actionablebooks.com/authors/frans-johansson/) as a kind of follow up to [_The Medici Effect_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-medici-effect/), his earlier book on insights, innovation, and intersectionality. Here Johansson presents two radical concepts: that success is mostly random, and that despite that, we can redesign our operating strategies to get more of it.

I invite you to share, in the comments below, one thing you’re going to do to increase your chances for serendipity—either a way to find more opportunities or to expose yourself to ideas outside of your field(s).
