  ### Go All In


  > "The only real reason a person fails in life is their inability to close
  others on providing resources, energy, money, support or whatever it is they
  need in order to achieve what it is they want"- The Closer’s Survival Guide,
  page 7


  This book made me realize how simple it is to get what I want out of life and
  why I haven’t always achieved the results I wanted in the past. Two key pieces
  of information that I found central to closing are:


  1.  Successful sales people **accept full responsibility** for the outcome of
  the sale.

  2.  You must be so **fully sold on your product** that you believe it is
  unethical for the prospect not to do business with you.


  The above two points made sense to me because I realized that anytime I’ve got
  rapid results in my life is when I’ve directed all of my energy into focusing
  on what I could do to make things happen, as opposed to things outside of my
  control.

  ### Earn Professional Status


  > "The true PROFESSIONAL CLOSER or ‘PRO CLOSER’ is the individual who has
  taken the time to observe what is happening, record his experiences and
  practice, drill, and rehearse before he enters the closing situation."- The
  Closer’s Survival Guide, page 31


  If you have ever heard of the 10,000 hour rule of “practice to become an
  expert at anything”, you will be pleased to know it won’t take that long to
  become a professional closer. Grant estimates that if you spent a tenth of
  this time, your results would skyrocket. Grant makes sense of this by defining
  two forms of learning:


  1.  **Proactive Learning.** Create an experience and practice, drill and
  rehearse the possible scenarios. As a result you will acquire a certainty
  about how to close deals. For example, try spending 30 minutes where you
  write, read and repeat the answer to a typical objection that you get.

  2.  **Reactive Learning.** Ever heard of the statement we learn from
  experience? Put yourself in situations that will require you to use the skill
  you are trying to acquire and see what result you get and keep making changes
  as you go along (trial and error).


  I realized the importance of proactive learning and committing to following
  through with actions. The good news is that anyone can become significantly
  better. You don’t need to necessarily invest 10 years or 10,000 hours to begin
  to see results. Blocking off time each day to implement these strategies would
  enable you to learn how to get what you want out of life.

  ### No Close = No Exchange = No Real Value


  > "If there is no exchange and no action, then there is no close; then there
  is no real value exchanged."- The Closer’s Survival Guide, page 10


  I can think of many times in my life where I did not fully commit to a skill
  to see it through. As a result, I now make a conscious effort to only commit
  to projects I can see myself completing and schedule the appropriate time to
  ensure I complete them. Grant uses a great analogy to explain this: “if you
  stop working out before you get results, was there really any value? Until you
  start losing weight or improving muscle tone, no ‘real’ value has been
  attained – you never received any exchange for your workouts”. In sales this
  is where the sales rep quits before they get an agreement and never get a
  close.


  There is a saying that the Chinese Bamboo tree takes about five years before
  it cracks the surface of the soil, and in the fifth year it grows over 80 feet
  tall in just six weeks. It took years of nourishing with light and water to
  help it grow, and without it the tree never would have matured.


  Can you think of a time where you stopped short of seeing any “real” value for
  the efforts you put in with a prospect or a project you committed to? Compare
  that to when you followed a project through to the end and witnessed the end
  result. What was different?
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Closer’s Survival Guide_ is well worth your investment in both the time
  and money. If you want to learn how to close and get your products and
  services into the market place or simply get what you want, then this book is
  for you. Grant empowers the reader, showing how he became top of his field in
  only a couple of years. What I found the most useful was not the closes and
  how to respond to them but rather the focus I developed in creating my own
  system, so that I too could become a professional in my own field. This book
  is essential for those new to sales to help acquire true sales leader habits,
  and for the veterans to help take their game to the next level.

> "It’s the ability to close that makes a difference more than any other skill you will learn in life" _\- The Closer’s Survival Guide, page ix_

This is the third book I have read by international sales training and business coach Grant Cardone. _The Closer’s Survival Guide_ differs from Grant’s other books ([_The 10x Rule_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-10x-rule/), [_Sell or Be Sold_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/sell-or-be-sold/), and [_If You Are Not First, You’re Last_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/if-youre-not-first-youre-last/)), in that it is broken down into two parts: the theory of closing and a compilation of different closes and how to manage objections.

The beginning of the book focuses on the most critical part in the sales cycle: determining whether there will be a transaction or not. This book brought to my awareness that we close every day, whether it be as a kid trying to get money for candy or asking for your partner’s hand in marriage. While closing occurs every day, I also realized looking back on past experiences my hesitancy to perform these closes.

I realize there have opportunities in my life where I was not confident to ‘close’, due to my prior experiences growing up and lack of confidence. Grant exposes all of the reasons for not closing and explains them in great detail.

I remember waiting six months to ask a girl out in grade 7 because I wasn’t sure what to say. However, when I finally did she said yes! Other times my complacency was trumped by others who knew how to close and achieve the end goal. The things we want do not just fall into our lap, we must use specific techniques, strategies, and take specific actions. Grant’s book shows the reader how to get whatever they want in life, if you commit all in and learn how to sell, negotiate and most of all close.
