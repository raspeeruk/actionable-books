  ### Leaders Need To Make Coaching A Habit


  > "To build an effective new habit, you need five essential components: a
  reason, a trigger, a micro-habit, effective practice, and a plan."- The
  Coaching Habit, page 18


  Before getting into the details of how to coach effectively, the book starts
  with guidance on how to make coaching part of your regular routine. As the
  author notes, there’s no point spending time on building a new skill if you
  don’t change your behavior at the same time. By working through the steps,
  from defining the reasons for starting to coach and when you intend to use it,
  to beginning to practice on a smaller basis before moving into using it more
  broadly, you’ll develop a routine that ultimately becomes a habit.


  The final step in building a habit is having a plan for knowing how you will
  recover quickly if you forget to use your new skill. Rather than giving up if
  you keep forgetting to do it, identify two or three phrases (such as saying
  “but before we get to my thoughts, what ideas do you have so far?”) to allow
  you to recover and get back on track.


  If you’ve been avoiding coaching in your role because you think you need to
  take a course or spend lots of time learning a difficult new skill, the book
  gives you an easy way to get started. It’s simply knowing what to say.

  ### Tame The Advice Monster


  > "Even though we don't really know what the issue is, we're quite sure we've
  got the answer they need."- The Coaching Habit, page 61


  One of the reasons we need to move away from giving advice and coach instead
  is we don’t always know what’s best, or have full information about the
  situation that requires a solution. The author takes the point further with a
  blunt haiku:


  Tell less and ask more.  

  Your advice is not as good  

  As you think it is.


  “When we’re in Rescuer mode,” the author explains, “we’re constantly leaping
  in to solve problems, jumping in to offer advice, taking over responsibilities
  that others should rightfully keep for themselves. We do it with good
  intentions . . . \[but there’s\] the price that’s being paid by both sides.
  You’re exhausted – and they’re irritated.”


  Staying out of advice mode and instead using one of the essential coaching
  questions allows the ownership and accountability for solving the problem to
  stay with the person who has the issue. It’s win-win because they feel more
  empowered to solve it on their own and you can get back to your own to-do
  list.

  ### Begin Coaching By Asking Questions


  > "Coaching for development is about turning the focus from the issue to the
  person dealing with the issue, the person who's managing the fire."- The
  Coaching Habit, page 40


  It can’t be much easier than this: when you’re asked “how should I do this?”,
  your response should be to ask guiding, probing questions that help the
  individual uncover the right answer.


  The author gives us seven great questions to use in various combinations to
  create powerful coaching conversations.


  **The Seven Essential Coaching Questions:**


  1.  **The Kickstart Question:** “What’s on your mind?”

  2.  **The AWE Question:** “And what else?”

  3.  **The Focus Question:** “What’s the real challenge here for you?”

  4.  **The Foundation Question:** “What do you want?”

  5.  **The Lazy Question:** “How can I help?”

  6.  **The Strategic Question:** “If you’re saying yes to this, what are you
  saying no to?”

  7.  **The Learning Question:** “What was most useful to you about this
  conversation?”


  If someone comes to you to ask for a few minutes, open with “What’s on your
  mind?” If they ask what they should do, try saying “What’s the real challenge
  for you with this?” You can see how the flow keeps the ownership for what to
  do next with the person who raised the issue.


  In addition to getting in the habit of asking questions, there’s one other
  habit you need to build.
f_conclusion: >-
  If you’re reading this and thinking none of it applies to you because you
  aren’t a manager, you’re in luck. Everyone can be a coach and use the
  questions from this book. When a colleague comes to you for advice (and
  perhaps secretly wanting you to jump in and help do the work), instead of
  offering solutions, try using one of the seven coaching questions and see how
  the conversation moves forward in a very different way.

> "Call them forward to learn, improve and grow, rather than just get something sorted out." _\- The Coaching Habit, page 41_

Full disclosure: I am a big fan of Michael Bungay Stanier, and I was excited about his new book _The Coaching Habit_ before I even read it. Once I had, I knew it was going to be the answer to the challenge many leaders have with how to incorporate the much-needed role of coaching into their day-to-day work.

Coaching has become a popular word in the corporate world, and many leaders know this is something they should be doing, but aren’t sure it’s worth the effort or are convinced they don’t have the time. As the book notes, quoting Daniel Goleman, many leaders “don’t have time in this high-pressure economy for the slow and tedious work of teaching people and helping them grow.”

Admit it, you’ll never have more time. But with the research clearly showing that coaching can improve individual performance and bottom-line results, it’s worth the effort to build coaching into your role as leader, and see greater productivity, engagement and accountability in your team as a result.

It’s not as hard as you think.

This book is an essential resource in every leader’s toolkit. The only question left is, what do you need to do to make coaching a habit?
