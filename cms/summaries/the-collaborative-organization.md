  ### We Beats Me


  > "The more employees can share, communicate, collaborate, and engage with one
  another, the greater the flow of ideas is."- The Collaborative Organization,
  page 11


  In another fascinating flashback to pre-internet days, research done by T.J.
  Allen in 1977 found that when people worked more than 30 meters apart, they
  were less likely to collaborate and communicate with each other. Having worked
  in both large and small organizations, I have experienced this myself; you
  tend to talk things over with people you see regularly than you do with
  co-workers that reside in other areas of the building, never mind in another
  country. And yet, when you make the effort to connect with those outside your
  regular work or social space, you often have conversations that lead you to
  new insights and ideas.


  So why is email still the go-to tool used by many to ‘collaborate and
  communicate’ even though it was not really designed for that purpose? We use
  it simply because everyone has it. Emergent collaboration tools can engage a
  broader range of people for problem-solving and innovation. Given many in
  today’s workforce (and future workforce) are mini-Morgans, people who have
  grown up using platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Skype, and other
  social networking tools, and recognizing business is becoming increasingly
  global in nature, it makes sense to leverage collaborative applications for
  business purposes.

  ### #Sharing-Knowledge-Freely


  > "There are two types of knowledge that need to be shared and transferred at
  organizations: new knowledge and old knowledge."- The Collaborative
  Organization, page 17


  Too often organizations focus a disproportionate amount of their resources and
  attention on disseminating immediately relevant information to employees, to
  the neglect of capturing the wealth of historical knowledge and expertise
  housed within the craniums of those employees. This short-term focus has
  long-range implications that are easily overlooked until a veteran employee
  announces their resignation or retirement. Only then do leaders take notice
  and scramble to siphon as much gray matter as they can from the
  soon-to-be-gone employee.


  Morgan believes this can be overcome when employees use emergent technologies
  to store, share and retrieve information. Granted, companies still need to
  create a common architecture for organizing and tagging this information,
  however search engines like Google have certainly demonstrated the power of
  keyword searches for instant information retrieval. And the emergence of
  user-generated tags and hashtags on sites like Facebook and Twitter make
  virtual labeling systems accessible and easy for everyone. This certainly has
  advantages over traditional paper-based filing systems and cumbersome 1.0
  intranets.

  ### Sometimes Weak Beats Strong


  > "Emergent collaboration solutions allow the creation of strong ties, but
  more important, they allow for the creation of weak ties, or bridges, within
  organizations. These bridges allow employees to get access to information and
  people within a larger network instead of simply relying on the people they
  know."- The Collaborative Organization, page 13


  So, let’s get clear on what is meant by strong and weak links or ties. A
  strong tie represents a well-established connection you have with someone,
  like an immediate family member, friend or long-time co-worker. These
  relationships typically require consistent and ongoing effort to maintain.
  Weak ties are acquaintances, extended family, friends-of-friends, or
  colleagues with whom you have only occasional contact or no contact at all.
  These ties require minimal effort to maintain which is why you generally have
  more weak ties than strong ones.


  In our personal lives, blogs and social media sites like LinkedIn, Facebook
  and Twitter are examples of consumer-oriented applications that help people
  establish and leverage weak ties. In a work context, customized collaboration
  platforms offer similar benefits. Employees are able to create
  information-rich profiles which can then be searched when there is a need to
  find someone with a different knowledge base or skill set in order to solve a
  challenge. They can post status updates on projects, seek input on draft
  documents, float ideas or simply ask and answer questions in an open forum.
  On-line tools help us to tap into the wisdom of people we haven’t met, not
  simply the people we cross paths with every day.


  We all have benefited at one time or another from a weak tie, either
  personally or at work. A consultant who ran a workplace leadership program I
  attended several years ago later connected me with someone in her network.
  This new contact invited me to collaborate on a proposal that eventually
  generated business for both of us. I once attended a youth career fair where
  professionals like me were asked to connect students interested in a
  particular career with someone in their network who could answer their
  questions. I linked a student with my sister-in-law who works for an airline.


  If you are stymied with a problem or aren’t sure where to find the information
  you need, try reaching out to your weak ties to see if they have any potential
  solutions or can connect you with someone in their network who might be able
  to help.

  I confess that I didn’t learn what I expected to learn given the book’s title,
  however I didn’t come away empty-handed either! The book reminded me that
  technology has, is and will continue to shape how we connect with and interact
  with others. Social and collaboration tools can simplify how we share and
  access knowledge which is critical in this increasingly global world we live
  in. However, we need to use this technology consciously and judiciously
  because, at the end of the day, it is our interactions with people that will
  help us overcome our challenges and generate the breakthrough results we seek.

> "Technology is supposed to support us and do what we tell it to do. Instead we have the opposite: Technology tells us what to do and when to use it." _\- The Collaborative Organization, page 18_

Ah…the double-edged sword of technology. Originally designed to save us time only to have become for many a 24/7, all-consuming addiction! Emails, texts, BBMs, tweets, pings and pokes. When exactly did the tail start wagging the dog? And why would companies want to further immerse their employees in a virtual world by using web-based collaboration tools?

Author Jacob Morgan notes he has grown up using technology tools and “doesn’t remember what it was like to conduct business when these platforms did not exist.” Funny, I remember all too well the pain of writing my undergraduate thesis on a portable electric typewriter and having to later make corrections on pages 3, 12, 28 and 70, which necessitated retyping the entire manuscript! The phrase ‘cut and paste’ had an entirely different meaning back then! But I digress.

_The Collaborative Organization_ is a primer on how to harness the benefits of emergent collaborative software (aka Enterprise 2.0 tools and platforms) to solve business problems and foster innovation. Morgan covers off topics such as the business drivers for using web-based tools, risk assessment, developing a deployment strategy, overcoming employee resistance, measuring success and sustaining adoption. He builds a case for why such tools should become “the door to the organization where almost all work can get done” rather than an add-on tool that employees need to manage.
