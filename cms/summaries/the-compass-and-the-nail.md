  ### Character Repels or Attracts an Audience


  > "This is the basis for long-term sustainable relationships. As long as the
  company’s character is tended to deliberately, the manifestation in product
  and service will remain valuable. A first impression leads to validation of
  that first impression, which leads to deeper understanding and an alignment of
  beliefs; blink, test, bond, love. We move from a superficial introduction to a
  deep state of resonance."- The Compass and the Nail, page 60


  In the eye of the customer, it’s the company’s character that sets it apart
  from the competition. A company can build and lose loyalty for different
  reasons. Some companies build loyalty on convenience but, followers will be
  swayed if a competitor offers a better price, is closer, or faster. Other
  brands built loyalty on promotion but, big-budget advertising is necessary to
  keep the name visible. Some brands focus on supplying a superior product, but
  their following disappears if a competitor develops a more innovative product.
  Many organizations that identify with a mission or cause have a charismatic
  leader that inspires a faithful tribe. Tribes have a committed following as
  long as the leader doesn’t compromise their reputation or authenticity. If a
  brand’s loyalty is rooted in ethics, the organization must stay true to the
  deeply held beliefs of its followers, and dishonesty is quickly detected.
  These are all characteristics customers use to distinguish and choose, one
  brand over another. A brand must stay true to it’s identifying characteristics
  to inspire long-term relationships with a core group of advocates.


  Wilson describes the stages of customer loyalty from prospect to brand
  advocate as blink, test, bond, love. The customer progresses through these
  steps because the company’s values resonate with the customer. Straying from
  that identity undermines customer confidence, and the group will not form a
  strong fan base.

  ### You Have to Earn Loyalty


  > "Ideally, loyalty should conjure up a vision of your organization’s actions:
  the actions that lead to committed behavior from your customers. Do you know
  what those actions are? Do you know where the missteps are? Do you know how
  healthy your relationship (loyalty) truly is?"- The Compass and the Nail, page
  137


  Customer loyalty programs dilute the meaning of loyalty. These programs,
  discount cards, airline miles, awarded points, and others, give customers
  something or pay them to buy. These incentives may generate sales but not avid
  loyalty. Price loyalty is fragile, customers will buy from a lower bidder and
  are easily dissatisfied with some other aspect of the product or service.


  Statistics are also often quoted with the word loyalty. Companies often rely
  on statistics that measure customer satisfaction such as the Net Promoter
  Score (NPS). These statistics provide information about a customers
  satisfaction rating. They don’t analyze specific actions the company took to
  earn their satisfaction nor do they supply insight on building stronger
  relationships and genuine loyalty.


  It’s more useful to determine what actions the organization takes that
  resonate with and inspire core supporters that are passionate, loyal
  advocates. It may be the customer’s experience with a salesperson or customer
  service representative or their online exposure. It could be a beautiful
  catalog depicting the quality and value of the items for sale balancing the
  company’s principles. There may be many different ways customers interact with
  the company, and all of them are opportunities to take actions that resonate
  with shared values.

  ### Cater to Values Instead of Customers


  > "The mistake to avoid is believing that your most avid buyer, your most
  profitable customer, defines your brand. They don’t. They follow your brand
  because of what you stand for. They follow your core users because of what
  they stand for as well."- The Compass and the Nail, page 98


  Early adopters initially form the group of core supporters, and they are the
  first group to resonate with the company’s values. Late adopters follow the
  initial group of core supporters, and they resonate with the early adopters as
  well as the company’s principles. Late adopters may eventually join the core
  promoters if they develop a deep connection to the organization’s values. The
  group that follows the core advocates is much larger than the loyal core. The
  more substantial followers have broader values and needs, and they may
  generate more profit than the core group.


  It might be tempting for a company to change its characteristics to cater to
  the large and profitable group of casual supporters in an attempt to enlarge
  their group of core users. In part, this category follows the company’s core
  advocates, and if the company changes the characteristics that resonate with
  these advocates, they will lose their support and consequently, the support of
  casual supporters. It might seem intuitively right to pursue profitable
  customers by tailoring your brand to their needs. Instead, changing may
  eliminate the reason they buy from you.
f_conclusion: >-
  To build an avid fan base, find the place where your organization’s principles
  connect to your following. The connection is the reason people choose you
  instead of another association. Develop your company around these values. Make
  them omnipresent in every interaction with your audience. Don’t abandon these
  ethics to suit a broader set of prospects; these morals are the reason people
  choose you. People fall in love because they resonate with who you are. Your
  consistency of character is the reason they select you repeatedly and advocate
  intensely.

  “This is the decisive moment: Clearly establishing a foothold understanding
  where your organization’s values intersect with your audience, then digging
  into the detail as a means to create process and an operating principle to
  move forward. This is the new means to create lasting value in the
  relationship between an organization of any kind and the people it serves;
  applied to politics, economic strategies, causes, businesses, etcetera. It’s a
  universal truth.”

Consumers have an ever increasing selection of similar products and services to choose from that will meet their needs. However, some brands inspire connection and consumers consistently choose them over others, and advocate for them. What transforms customers into passionate brand advocates? Craig Wilson explores a practical model for connecting with customers through shared company values to develop a fervent following in, _The Compass and the Nail: How the Patagonia model of loyalty can save your business, and might just save the planet_.

Wilson explains the science of advocacy in-depth. Ethics is at the heart of generating an intense following. People want to be part of something bigger that makes the world a better place. When they find a company that shares their beliefs they form a bond and become intensely loyal. Wilson quotes Sir Walter Scott, “A rusty nail placed near a faithful compass, will sway it from the truth, and wreck the Argosy.” The quote is referenced in the title of the book: corruption of values will steer an organization off course. For this summary I’ll focus on how maintaining a consistent character attracts a core of believers that sustain long-term success.
