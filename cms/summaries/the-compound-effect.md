  ### The Tale of 3 Friends


  > "If you were given the choice between taking $3 million in cash this very
  instant and a single penny that doubles in value every day for 31 days, which
  would you choose?"- The Compound Effect, page 10


  If you chose the penny, by day 31 you would have $10,737,418.24 (!) and your
  friend who chose the $3 million, would likely still have $3 million. It is
  these small compounding effects over time that make the huge differences in
  our lives. And this is the The Big Idea of the book.


  Hardy gives a great example of three friends. You might be able to picture
  them in fact. Here is the abridged version.


  Larry plods along doing as he has always done.


  Scott decides to make some small, seemingly inconsequential positive changes.
  He begins reading ten pages a day and listening to self-improvement audios,
  cuts 125 calories out of each day by trading a can of soda for water, starts
  walking an extra couple thousand steps a day.


  Brad makes a few poor choices. He invests in a big screen TV so he can enjoy
  more of his favourite shows. He starts eating dessert more often and puts a
  new bar in his family room which leads him to add about one more drink per
  week. Nothing crazy, Brad’s just looking for a little more fun.


  Ten months later – no perceivable difference is seen. But fast track to
  twenty-five months and we start seeing measurable, visible differences. At
  month twenty-seven, we see an expansive difference. And, by month thirty-one,
  the change is startling. Brad is now fat while Scott is trim. After investing
  in one thousand hours reading good books and listening to self-improvement
  audios, Scott earned a promotion at work and his marriage is thriving. Brad on
  the other hand, got sluggish from the weight gain, started feeling worse about
  himself and started retreating from his wife, which led to marital demise.
  Larry on the other hand, is exactly where he was two years ago but is now
  bitter about it.


  You get the picture. It is the small habits we create that lead to huge
  compounding effects.


  By the way, did you see yourself in the friends? Which one are you?

  ### Don't Want More. Become More!


  > "Success is something you attract by the person you become."- The Compound
  Effect, page 72


  Darren said that understanding this philosophy not only helped him find his
  wife but it also revolutionized his life. When he wanted to find a partner to
  marry, he made a long list (40 pages!) of traits he was looking for. He could
  have then asked himself two questions:


  1.  What do I have to do to get that woman?  
      _Or…_
  2.  Who do I need to become to be attractive to a woman like that?


  Had he focused on the first question, he thinks he would still be looking.
  Instead, by turning inward, and working on achieving the qualities that his
  ideal woman would want, she appeared before him, _“as if she were peeled off
  the pages of my journal”_ (page 73).


  He quotes Jim Rohn, a mentor of his, who said _“If you want to have more, you
  have to become more. Success is not something you pursue. What you pursue will
  elude you; it can be like trying to chase butterflies. Success is something
  you attract by the person you become.”_  

  It appears to be so simple. So why don’t people do it? It requires discipline
  and patience.


  _The Compound Effect_ gives us ideas that – when combined with consistent,
  positive action – will make a real and lasting difference in your life. I
  highly recommend you read it, again and again. I know I will.

  ### Gratitude Can Change Your Wife, I Mean Life


  > "When I gave it to her the following Thanksgiving she cried, calling it the
  best gift she’d ever received. (Even better than the BMW I’d given her for her
  birthday!)"- The Compound Effect, page 27


  And would you believe that Darren said he was even more affected by this gift
  he gave his wife than she was! What was the gift, you ask? Each day for a year
  he secretly wrote one thing that he appreciated in her. In the end he’d filled
  an entire journal which showed her how much he appreciated her and maybe even
  more importantly, showed him! He said that by consciously looking for all the
  things she was doing “right” there was little room to find things to complain
  about.


  And isn’t that the way we should move through each day; focusing on the
  gratitude for the things that are right; pushing out any room for complaining.

As the publisher of _SUCCESS_ magazine, Darren Hardy sits at the centre of the personal development industry. All day, each and every day, he filters through an ocean of personal achievement wisdom.

Wouldn’t it be great if he could just summarize all his lessons for us? Well that’s exactly what he did in _The Compound Effect_. And he did it in an engaging way that empowers us with more confidence and ideas to be more successful. Additionally, and importantly, he gives us the system and plan of action to make those changes happen.

I had the pleasure of meeting Darren Hardy recently while in New York (who by the way is every bit as charming and sincere as he sounds in the book) so I asked him “_What are the two things people talk about most from your book?_” He said the two things that made the biggest difference for people were:

1.  The thank you book
2.  His perfect match list

I’ll talk more about these below in insight #1 and #2. But first let’s talk about the underlining message or The Big Idea of this book.

### The Big Idea
