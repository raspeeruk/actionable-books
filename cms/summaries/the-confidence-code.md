  ### Being good isn’t that good


  > "Soon we learn that we are most valuable, and most in favor, when we do
  things the right way: neatly and quietly. We begin to crave the approval we
  get for being good. And there’s no harm intended: Who doesn’t want a kid who
  doesn’t cause a lot of trouble"- The Confidence Code, page 88


  It turns out that the girls who were the quietest and good growing up end up
  lacking confidence. What does this mean for adults who have always thrived on
  being good? You need to leave that comfort zone and start to take action. Good
  isn’t always best, and you’ll gain more confidence (and the respect that goes
  along with it) if you speak up and occasionally take action. If you are
  raising children, start by not over-criticizing the bad behavior and
  over-praising the good behavior.


  I am attracted to this theory of good girls not getting as far as women who
  speak up a little more. I was a good girl for much of elementary school, but
  it all changed in junior high. In junior high I was suspended over 8 times and
  then kicked out of the entire school division (not just my school, every
  school in the division!) I was violent (broke a girl’s jaw) and questioned all
  authority. Interestingly, when this comes up in conversation in a professional
  setting, people respond with, “I would have never guessed that”, “I am seeing
  you in a whole new light”, “better watch this one”. Those who know me, see me
  as compassionate first, “get it done” second. The image of me as a “reformed
  bad girl” actually boosts my credibility with people who assumed I was one
  way. It shows that I’m not afraid to take action when it is needed, and I’m
  not looking for approval.

  ### Adopt a growth mind-set


  > "Confidence requires a growth mind-set because believing that skills can be
  learned leads to doing new things. It encourages risk, and it supports
  resilience when we fail"- The Confidence Code, page 128


  Confidence requires a growth mind-set, a mind that allows us to see everything
  as an adventure and learning experience, rather than another chance to fail. A
  growth mind-set (concept credited to Carol Dweck) is believing that you can
  improve and learn new things. It means not avoiding or giving up on something
  because it’s hard for you to learn, but to keep working on it for improvement.
  It means that when parents talk to their children they should encourage them
  to participate in things that are not easy for them, and where they might fail
  – because confidence comes from trying and making progress, not achieving
  perfection.

  ### Embrace your differentness


  > "…genuinely confident women, perhaps genuinely confident people, don’t feel
  they have to hide anything. They are who they are, warts and all, and if you
  don’t like it, or think it is weak to show vulnerability, too bad for you"-
  The Confidence Code, page 133


  Confidence is not about pretending to be anything other than what you are, and
  being comfortable showing more than a superficial version of yourself. Don’t
  care so much about blending in, embrace what makes you special – it will
  probably be what is appreciated the most. When I was changing careers, I would
  attend interviews pretending to be more boring – scared to show my energetic
  and creative side, and coming off as a complete bore. At the last interview I
  decided, “Whether they like me or not, I am just going to be myself and own
  it”. I got the job offer. Embrace what makes you unique. Own it. Love it.
f_conclusion: >-
  Overall, _The Confidence Code_ is a useful resource for people interested in
  increasing their confidence in themselves and the science behind confidence.
  There is some solid advice throughout the book on how to use these concepts
  with your children to ensure the next generation is resilient and confident.
  It includes tips like letting children fail and praising children for trying
  rather than perfecting.

> "It is confidence that sways people. We may not realize it but we all give confidence inordinate weight and we respect people who project it" _\- The Confidence Code, page 23_

Confidence can be a touchy subject. I assume everyone is more confident than I am, and I’m confident. But in talking with other people, as authors Katty Kay and Claire Shipman did, it is quickly revealed that what you see on the outside is not the same as what is happening on the inside of a person. _The Confidence Code: The Science and Art of Self-Assurance – What Women Should Know_, examines the science behind confidence and what people, more specifically women, can do to increase their confidence.
