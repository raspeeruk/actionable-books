  ### Connect People to People


  > "What you need is a way to let customers pull you toward the things they
  need and want most."- The Connected Company, page 103


  If you are listening, your customers will tell you what they need. As
  companies grow, they focus on infrastructure, scaling, and other complexities
  that distract them from the customer. Gray walks through the challenges that
  Starbucks faced five years ago when their sales and profitability dropped, and
  their CEO realized they had lost touch with their customers. They refocused
  internally with staff, and rebuilt their business with a stronger push on
  staying connected to customer needs and staying true to their brand.


  Employees need to connect more deeply to each other as well. Connect them
  around a common purpose, bring them together to share experiences and learn
  from each other, and find ways to reinforce those connections through internal
  tools that allow them to share information.

  ### Learn, Change, Grow, Repeat


  > "To adapt, companies must operate not as machines, but as learning
  organisms, purposely interacting with their environment and continuously
  improving, based on experiments and feedback."- The Connected Company, page 74


  The idea of learning organizations isn’t a new one, but today organizations
  are realizing that it is not enough to train employees; instead, you need to
  build an environment that encourages employees to use what they have learned
  to change how they work. Understanding how to learn from failure and recover
  is part of this mindset, and the strongest organizations are the ones who are
  continuing to grow and evolve. Gray provides the example of GE’s “Work-Out”
  program, where employees step away from the assembly line to provide process
  improvement feedback to management. It’s a great example of bringing
  front-line employees and management together to learn about making critical
  changes.

  ### Structural Change Is Necessary


  > "Big companies are inevitably slow and cumbersome; small companies are quick
  and responsive. Therefore, break big companies into the smallest pieces
  possible."- Lou Gerstner, quoted in The Connected Company, page 135


  Companies have layers, no question, but how you structure those layers can
  make all the difference. Traditional hierarchies work well for reporting “up”
  results, but that means employees are more vested in looking internally than
  outwards to their customers. Gray describes instead the need to create smaller
  hubs of people, with the tools or “platform” to allow front-line employees to
  be a single point-of-contact for solving customer needs.


  Whether you refer to them as pods, holarchies or fractal work units, Gray
  challenges us to think about building businesses within the business, where
  “each part is also a fully-functional whole in its own right” (p.135),
  allowing them the agility to solve complex problems quickly. Gray provides the
  example of Whole Foods, where store product teams are provided with data and
  tools, allowing them to operate autonomously and make their own front-line
  decisions.
f_conclusion: >-
  It can feel daunting to imagine implementing some of the changes outlined in
  this book, but you can start by looking at the structure of your organization,
  and what elements are keeping you from staying close to your customers. The
  book provides extensive company examples of putting these practices into
  place, as well as guidance on how to lead a connected company, which helps
  bring the ideas from the book to life.

We see it all the time – companies that start out as small, nimble, entrepreneurial entities, but as they grow, they add layers of people, processes and complexity. What happens? They become inflexible, slow moving and unable to quickly respond to the changing needs of their customers or industry.

In _The Connected Company_, author Dave Gray (with Thomas Vander Wal) outlines how organizations need to create better connections between employees, enabling them to maintain the dynamic and fast-response mindset of a start up environment. Customers today are using social media to form powerful communities that at times can take control of your brand. Companies need to be able to connect to these communities and respond quickly.

“Companies must be flexible enough to rapidly respond to changes in their environments, or risk extinction.”

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Connect People to People

> "What you need is a way to let customers pull you toward the things they need and want most."- The Connected Company, page 103

If you are listening, your customers will tell you what they need. As companies grow, they focus on infrastructure, scaling, and other complexities that distract them from the customer. Gray walks through the challenges that Starbucks faced five years ago when their sales and profitability dropped, and their CEO realized they had lost touch with their customers. They refocused internally with staff, and rebuilt their business with a stronger push on staying connected to customer needs and staying true to their brand.

Employees need to connect more deeply to each other as well. Connect them around a common purpose, bring them together to share experiences and learn from each other, and find ways to reinforce those connections through internal tools that allow them to share information.

Written in pods similar to the framework outlined, _The Connected Company_ is delivered in chunks that can be read all as once or worked through in stages. With incredible illustrations to guide you, this book shows you what it takes to create an organization that connects people – to each other, between layers, and to their customer community.
