  ### Clarity not clutter


  > "Mindset mastery is something most successful trailblazers do and it’s vital
  for you to bring your dreams to life"- The Conquer Kit, page 9


  Becoming clear about your goals and having personal awareness are the central
  principles of _The Conquer Kit._ To “get in the flow” MacNeil emphasises the
  importance of taking a step back (from wherever you are on your
  entrepreneurial journey) and purposefully reminding yourself of the core goals
  you set out to achieve, and the reasons you want to be in business.


  Knowing your personal archetype or ‘type’ is a useful way to recognise the
  challenges that are most common for certain personalities and the ways these
  issues are most likely to detract from your success. _The Conquer Kit_
  introduces eight female entrepreneur archetypes inspired by the original ‘ego’
  and ‘self’ types used by psychologist Carl Jung in the early twentieth
  century. MacNeil’s modern business woman types are:


  **The Queen**  

  Attributes: Fearless leader  

  Challenges: Commands respect, egocentric mindset


  **The Revolutionary**  

  Attributes: Clear vision  

  Challenges: Reinventing process; prefers originality


  **The Dreamer**  

  Attributes: Big picture thinker  

  Challenges: Daydreamer; follow-through


  **The Builder**  

  Attributes: Results oriented  

  Challenges: Perfectionist; detail oriented


  **The Commander**  

  Attributes: Administrative centric  

  Challenges: Micromanager, lacks flexibility


  **The Contributor**  

  Attributes: Big giver, philanthropist  

  Challenges: Easily discouraged, not profit oriented


  **The Creator**  

  Attributes: Unconventional thinker  

  Challenges: Administration, process


  **The Messenger**  

  Attributes: Five star communicator  

  Challenges: Brand focused, customer centric


  Nothing great lasts with shaky foundations. That’s not to say that what you’ve
  already started isn’t great. But, addressing areas of your business that just
  aren’t fun for you, that leave you feeling stressed and deflated can really
  make a difference in moving positively towards your business goals. Now is
  your chance.

  ### Goal setting


  > "Finding time to plan out the next year, when you are distracted by the
  dirty dishes and a full Netflix queue, will prove to be challenging."- The
  Conquer Kit, page 179


  _The Conquer Kit_ refers to Napoleon Hill, author of _Think and Grow Rich_
  who, like MacNeil, is also a great believer in a person’s positive mindset
  being the absolutely key to success. You may be familiar with his quote “A
  goal is just a dream with a deadline.”


  Goal setting is not something we usually think positively about, because it
  sounds and feels like an onerous task, a time waster. Not any more. **_Month
  Mapping_**, a clever business planning alternative from the book, overhauls
  the boring task of tracking your business progress, your marketing efforts and
  financials against personal goals and your bottom line in four easy sections:


  1\. Each month, list your consistent **_“Balanced Ambitions”_** which are:


  *   **Money:** e.g. Earn $5,500 in revenue. Save $500

  *   **Career and Learning:** e.g. Read [_Good to
  Great_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/good-to-great/)

  *   **Giving Back:** e.g. Volunteer with a local charity

  *   **Health: e.**g. Walk 10,000 steps each day

  *   **Relationship:** e.g. One date a week with your spouse


  2\. Next, write down you **_“Conscious Creation”_** (marketing tools) such as:


  *   Social media

  *   Crete blog content

  *   Write new product copy


  3\. Then, capture your **_“Big Picture Milestones”._** Examples are:


  *   Contact 100 new prospective clients

  *   Send information packs to 20 potential suppliers


  4\. Finally, be sure to record **_“Reflections”_** from the month. These would
  be individual and personal but could include reflection on:


  *   The biggest risk I took…

  *   The most valuable lesson I learned…

  *   A new connection I made…


  After **_Month Mapping_** for 3, 6 and 12 months you will have developed a
  well documented, but more importantly, personalised business record that
  aligns your business goals with your sense of purpose. Goal setting that’s
  relevant and maybe even a little bit of fun too.

  ### Know your customers


  > "No matter what business you are in, having a process for welcoming and
  supporting new customers is a fundamental necessity to help them feel cared
  for and totally loyal to you for the long term."- The Conquer Kit, page 87


  If you’re already in business you may have data and analytics that tell you
  who your loyal clients are. When thinking about potential _new_ clients, to
  match your existing or soon-to-be launched product successfully, MacNeil
  suggests creating “an insanely detailed picture of your client” first.
  Defining your ideal customer will help you form a business idea that will be
  more likely to attract them.


  *   Are they a man or a woman? What’s her name?

  *   Where does she live? City or suburbs?

  *   How are old is she?

  *   What does she read – which magazines, website or books?

  *   How does she spend her free time?

  *   What is she willing to splurge on?


  You get the idea. _The Conquer Kit_ takes knowing your customers beyond the
  traditional marketing concepts of customer segmentation and demographics, into
  a very personalised customer experience mindset. To get there, think about the
  products and services you love and why. Why do you keep going back to them?
  What problem do they solve for you?
f_conclusion: >-
  There is something to be said for writing stuff down. Impossible dreams and
  moments of inspiration become tangible. _The Conquer Kit_’s format gives you
  the opportunity to step away from your everyday “all-business” female
  entrepreneurial approach and have some honest ‘girlie’, diary-like fun in the
  process of building your business empire.

  "Your business will impact people’s lives far beyond your own. People will
  read what you write and change their minds. They use your products to feel
  happier and more connected to their lives and the world around them."
