  ### Seven kinds of courage


  > "Courage is the great balancer of power in relationships. An individual, who
  is not afraid to speak and act on the truth as she perceives it, despite
  external inequities in a relationship, is a force to be reckoned with."- The
  Courageous Follower, page 20


  To be a partner-follower of a leader requires courage. Without courage, a
  follower is not apt to challenge a leader’s behavior, policies, or decisions.
  Chaleff lists the following six kinds of courage that he feels the
  partner-follower should exhibit in supporting an organization’s leader:


  *   **The courage to assume responsibility** – responsibility for the
  organization and responsibility for one’s self. To have this kind of courage
  you must stop viewing the leader-follower relationship as a type of
  parent-child or teacher-pupil relationship.

  *   **The courage to serve** – not being afraid of the hard work required to
  serve a leader.

  *   **The courage to challenge** – the willingness to voice concern when a
  leader’s or group’s behaviors or policies conflict with the follower’s sense
  of what is right.

  *   **The courage to participate in transformation** – being willing to
  champion the need for change and to stay with the organization and leader as
  they mutually struggle to make real change.

  *   **The courage to take moral action** – the willingness to take a stand
  that is different from their leader. Not shying from holding themselves, the
  leader, and the organization to a set of higher standards and values.

  *   **The courage to speak to the hierarchy** – regardless of one’s title, a
  courageous follower is one that is willing to speak to anyone above in the
  hierarchy.


  Chaleff devotes a separate chapter to each of these kinds of courage and
  follows them with a chapter on a kind of courage that the leader needs to
  exhibit in support of courageous followers — the courage to listen to
  followers.

  ### Served "just right"


  > "As we develop and form our self-image, we start screening out feedback that
  contradicts that image. For those who become public figures – CEOs,
  principals, commanding officers, managing partners, politicians – protecting
  this public image may seem most important. More screens go up, and the only
  messages that penetrate are the ones that validate our image of ourselves."-
  The Courageous Follower, page 90


  Whereas insight #1 suggests consideration of our own communication style,
  insight #2 is specifically about delivering messages in ways that protect a
  leader’s ego. When you are faced with giving feedback to a leader about his or
  her behavior, Chaleff suggests two tactics and provides examples of each. The
  first tactic is to preface the feedback with defusing statements that convey
  respect and remind the leader of the value of honesty. For example, “You know
  that I respect what you are trying to do, and I’m sure you’d want me to be
  honest with you” or “You know how highly I think of your work, and I hope you
  won’t mind my speaking frankly.”


  The second tactic Chaleff recommends is linking the feedback to outcomes that
  the leader desires, or what motivates them. For example, “I think what you are
  doing will affect (what the leader values). May I give you my views?”


  As a corporate trainer and Organizational Development professional, I like to
  think that I’m pretty good at communicating with leaders. I plan on using some
  of the ideas, approaches, and phrases from this book to become an even
  stronger, more courageous, partner-follower.


  Are you an Implementer-follower or a partner-follower? If you are a
  partner-follower, how are you courageous?

  ### Courageously Earning Partner Follower Status


  > "Sometimes, followers who have a lot to offer fail to form a relationship
  with a leader that permits them to contribute all that they can."- The
  Courageous Follower, page 82


  Courageous followers, like leaders, are not born with the status. They must
  earn it. To earn the respect of and credibility with a leader is not easy.
  Chaleff references Baldesar Castiglione, a contemporary of Machiavelli, in
  explaining that, “it is only through a relationship of service to a leader,
  rendered in ways the leader can appreciate and value, that a follower builds a
  platform from which to meaningfully influence the tone and performance of the
  leader’s tenure.”


  For me, the key takeaway here is the awareness that to be seen as a
  partner-follower by a leader is not just about having the courage to speak up.
  It’s also about making sure that you speak up in ways that the leader is apt
  to appreciate and value. To help uncover what those “ways” might be, Chaleff
  makes several suggestions.


  The first suggestion, one that I’ve long practiced and espoused is to seek
  feedback from others on your communication style.


  The second suggestion, one that the rugged individualist in me has not tried,
  is to observe others who appear to have successfully won a leader’s trust.
  Chaleff doesn’t recommend that we simply copy these people. Instead, he offers
  the following questions to guide us in learning from the contrast that might
  be observable:


  *   Who seems to serve both the leader and the common purpose in ways that the
  leader readily accepts?

  *   What do they do that contributes to the leader being so receptive to their
  input?

  *   How does this contrast with our own approach?

  *   Is there something we can learn that will allow us to improve the quality
  of our own approach to the leader?

  *   Is there a way to adapt what we observe to the reality of who we are?

  *   What will it take for us to integrate this change so it is natural and
  sustainable?

  *   If our own efforts to support a leader are generally or occasionally well
  received, what contributes to our success, and how can we reinforce this?

The author of _The Courageous Follower: Standing Up to and for Our Leaders_, Ira Chaleff, wrote the above in the preface to the first edition of his book in 2003. The latest edition of the book (the third) was published in 2009, but even now in 2013, the situation hasn’t changed much. I did a quick search on Amazon using the terms “followership” and “leadership” to see how many titles were listed. Perhaps not surprisingly, my search resulted in 257 titles for “followership” compared to 18,167 titles for “leadership.” It seems we’re still much more interested in leadership than we are in followership.

Chaleff’s book begins to address the overall lack of attention to followership. Early in the book he presents a four quadrant model of followership based on the dimensions of support (i.e. high support, low support) and challenge (high challenge, low challenge). This results in the following four categories:

1\. **Partners** – followers who provide high levels of support and are also willing to challenge the leader when they feel doing so helps the leader and the organization.  
2\. **Implementers** – followers who provide high levels of support, but are not willing or do not feel it necessary to challenge the leader.  
3\. **Individualists** – followers who do not provide much support for the leader and tend to challenge a leader frequently. (I’m not sure these are actually “followers.” Perhaps “challengers” would be a more appropriate label.)  
4\. **Resources** – followers who put in a good day of work, but don’t go beyond the minimum expected of them.

Chaleff wrote this book primarily for people who aspire to be partner-followers.
