  ### The ONE question


  > "If we were having this discussion three years from today, and you were
  looking back over those three years, what has to have happened in your life,
  both personally and professionally, for you to feel happy with your
  progress?"- The Dan Sullivan Question, page 11


  In the world of continually increasing complexity and everyone fighting to
  take a piece of attention of people, how do you differentiate yourself (in a
  client presentation or meeting) from anyone else?


  The answer is, **_with a question_**.


  Ask the question quoted above, and **_don’t say anything until the person
  answers_**. Become comfortable with an uncomfortable silence after this
  question if need be.


  Give people as much time as they need to answer this question. Don’t be
  surprised if they take an hour or two to answer this.


  This question enables people to simplify their personal and professional
  complexities by providing a framework that:


  *   Replaces confusion with clarity when they answer “what has to have
  happened for them to be happy with their progress”.

  *   Converts isolation into confidence when they realize that they can clarify
  their own future.

  *   Feelings of powerlessness transform into feelings of being capable as a
  result of their new clarity and confidence.

  ### Demonstrate Power


  > "I don't even know you. Why would I ever tell you anything about my
  future?"- The Dan Sullivan Question, page 19


  What people do in their business or life is a direct reflection of what is
  going on inside their mind, both consciously and subconsciously.


  If you face resistance such as the above quote, act the role of someone in
  charge. Close your books, thank for their time and walk away politely. And
  don’t look back.


  What if you are in a team setting and are presenting to a group of people and
  you see the resistance?


  This immediately shows that the group members are not aligned in their
  commitment and agendas. Don’t get yourself strangled in working with groups
  that go round in circles.


  In other words, tell them that you wanted to see if you could be useful to the
  prospect in his/her future. Since the prospect doesn’t want to tell you
  anything, there is nothing you could do for him/her. It’s not a good fit.


  And then walk away and give no second chance.


  People are used to vendors begging to buy their products or services. Vendors
  are willing to sell **even if there is no fit**. With you, if they are not a
  good fit, they can’t get your services no matter how much money they put on
  the table.


  That makes you valuable and rare. That feeds your inner power hungry beast
  too. That gives you tremendous confidence and people can sense this in your
  very next consultation.

  ### The Power of Pre-positioning


  > "Specifically, what dangers do you have now that need to be eliminated, what
  opportunities need to be captured, and what strengths need to be maximized?"-
  The Dan Sullivan Question, page 30


  This is an add-on question to the question above. Though it is secondary, it
  is also tremendously powerful. It boosts the emotional impact of the first
  question. It also allows for reflection and a focus on simplicity in a complex
  world.


  This question makes it easy for people to articulate what is most important to
  them by making them think inside a particular structure which uses their most
  powerful motivating emotions.


  Even the most rational people start their thinking from these powerful
  emotions


  *   Fear of losing something

  *   The excitement of gaining new things

  *   Confidence from capabilities and resources we already possess.


  These emotions motivate most of our thinking and achievement. They form the
  basis for how we act.


  People feel deprived of their emotional freedom with confusion, isolation, and
  powerlessness in the continuously growing complexity around them. **_This
  question suddenly gives them the sense of their emotional freedom._**


  Just asking this question **_puts you in the right position_** in your
  subject’s mind as somebody who care about them and someone who can help them.


  When people are confused by complexity, _fear is a great paralyzer_. But when
  they become clear, _fear becomes a great motivator_.


  You can also use the power of “three” to prioritize the answer. Steve Jobs was
  famous for using the rule of three in the development of iPod. Everything
  people want should be accessible _within three clicks._ “Three” is simple,
  easy to remember and easy to recall.


  When taking notes for the question you asked, note down the top three dangers
  (or challenges), top three biggest possibilities of gaining something new, and
  top three existing resources and capabilities that need to be maximized.


  This will give you a list of 9 possible opportunities of engagement. Becoming
  clear to this level of detail gives a great feeling to anyone who is having
  this conversation with you.


  This is the greatest service you can provide during your prospecting meeting.
  If you can solve one or more of the above 9 challenges, you’ve got a sales
  conversation, without being overtly salesy.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Dan Sullivan Question_ is a quick read (88 pages in total) but highly
  actionable. Rather than focusing on a lot of abstract ideas, this book focuses
  on the ONE question and on the way this question transforms lives.

> "Answers are a dime a dozen. What's rare in this world is a really great question. What's yours?" _\- The Dan Sullivan Question, page 9_

You can transform anyone’s future in just one question.

Dan Sullivan is the author of more than 30 publications. He is the founder of Strategic Coach Inc. and the creator of Strategic Coach Program. I was introduced to _The Dan Sullivan Question_ a couple of months ago by one of my teachers, Bill Baren. Ever since it has become part of my consulting practices, with surprising results.

Today, everyone is facing the huge challenge of adjusting to a continuously increasing complexity in all areas of life, thanks to short attention span, advertisements everywhere, and constant hunger to receive notifications. There are always more things to think about. This causes three problems. Please are experiencing greater confusion, isolation, and feelings of powerlessness, as things around them are forever changing.

How do you sell your high-value product or service to people who have a greater number of choices than ever before? Especially if you are someone who provides a high-value offering in a face-to-face setting? The key is to ask just one important question.

_The Dan Sullivan Question_ is a quick read (88 pages in total) but highly actionable. Rather than focusing on a lot of abstract ideas, this book focuses on the ONE question and on the way this question transforms lives.

I have been using this question in my own business with great results. I have noticed that almost every hyper-successful service I sign up for, is using a variation of this question.

This book is for anyone who sells anything through consultation or presentation. The application of the ONE question is **_especially crucial for high-value offers_**.

I am not exaggerating by saying that the outcome of including this ONE question in your practice is more quality sales. This question clearly helps your prospect see how their life will be with your help.

Helping people gain a sense of clarity, confidence, and capability that was missing before is a great service. This clearly is valuable for your clients.

You did it by making them more clear, confident and capable.

A great quality service is useless if it doesn’t fit the bigger picture. Most people are confused about their bigger picture. A ‘good enough’ quality offering is great if it fits the strategy well.

**_Test the results of this question on your next 10 engagements with your potential clients and see the difference._** Give it a fair try before judging whether it’s working for you or not.
