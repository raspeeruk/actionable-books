  ### Trial, Error and the Logical Leap


  > "At the time a heuristic is first tentatively proposed, no one can prove
  whether it is useful or valid at all."- The Design of Business, page 25


  That’s really the scary notion behind design thinking for a lot of people; by
  definition, you’re tackling an unknown as one half of your balancing act.
  You’re diving back into a mystery with no true sense of potential profit,
  timeline, or eventual product or service. It’s daunting for those of us who
  have spent most of our lives in a more “execution-style” business world. As
  such, many businesses end up unintentionally spending a disproportionate
  amount of time in the algorithm phase – refining, cost cutting and making
  incremental improvements.


  As the one exception in most companies, true designers have no problem in the
  world of the unknown, the unproven. In fact, they live for it. Giving a
  designer a big hairy question to solve, a budget and a timeline is to make a
  designers day. For the rest of us, though, we need to realize the importance
  of embracing this style of thinking and incorporating it into our daily
  functions. We need to proactively work to embrace our innovative tendencies.

  ### Ask the Right Question


  > "Because it is so well suited to satisfying the organizational demand for
  proof, reliability almost always trumps validity."- The Design of Business,
  page 45


  The question to ask is not “Why?” Hugely innovative ideas do not come from
  statements like “show me forecast projections for the next 30 years.” The
  question to ask is “Why not?” Don’t get caught up in what’s worked in the
  past. If you rely on past data to drive all your decisions, you’ll end up with
  variations of past results (incremental improvements at best). When P&G
  launched Pampers, the product was revolutionary. Pampers “Cruisers” was
  incremental progress. Small gain in market share, nothing revolutionary.
  Tide2Go, on the other hand, was a radical innovation for P&G. The rewards
  matched the impact. Innovation = truly new. It comes from going back to the
  beginning of the knowledge funnel and asking, “Why didn’t we explore this
  path? What’s might be down there?” It’s saying, “The market’s changed a bit
  since we originally created ‘product x’. Do you think the needs/desires of our
  customer base have changed since then?”

  ### Be a Noticer


  > "The design thinker, in the words of novelist Saul Bellow, is 'a first-class
  noticer.'"- The Design of Business, page 30


  The best ideas for your industry may already exist. They may be thriving (or
  flopping) outside of your industry. Have you seen [**the
  commercial**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq3CnqChrL4) on innovation where
  the guy gets an idea for a new drilling machine from his son’s bendy-straw at
  a fast food restaurant? The best ideas come from ones outside your day to day
  experience. They come from keeping your eyes open and truly ‘seeing’ the world
  around you – for all its possibilities and insights. What are you learning
  today from the world around you?
f_conclusion: >-
  Don’t be afraid to question. Yes, it’s more work to innovate. Yes, it takes
  more mental power, more resources, more funding. Yes, it’s uncertain and there
  is an element of risk involved. But it’s also the only way to create change;
  real change. A true design thinker doesn’t run foolhardy into extra costs and
  new challenges. But she doesn’t shy away from them either. Find the balance,
  and you will be a rock star in your organization.
