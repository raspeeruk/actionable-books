  ### Seven Fundamental Design Principles


  > "Each of the seven stages indicates a place where the person using the
  system has a question. The seven questions pose seven design themes. How
  should the design convey the information required to answer the user’s
  question? Through appropriate constraint and mappings, signifiers and
  conceptual models, feedback, and visibility."- The Design of Everyday Things,
  page 72


  Don Norman highlights each principle with his questions for the designers to
  gain feedback from the target audience from what they have produced:


  *   What do I want to accomplish?

  *   What are the alternative action sequences?

  *   What action can I do now?

  *   How do I do it?

  *   What happened?

  *   What does it mean?

  *   Is this okay? Have I accomplished my goal?


  **Principle 1: Discoverability**


  Pilot Mountain State Park in Pinnacle, North Carolina has a Ranger Station
  with public restrooms. It is easy to discover the design of the doors at the
  entrance of the Ranger Station and the restrooms inside because the door
  handles on both sides of the doors are long rods that can be pulled. However,
  only one side of the door functions properly when the door is pulled. The
  product produces the goal of opening the door, but there is an alternative
  action which changes the function.


  **Principle 2: Feedback**


  Once a product is put out on the market or in the planning stages for launch,
  it is important to gain feedback about the product to ensure the design
  answers the question “what do I want the product to accomplish?” This will not
  only help the consumer but it will also help the company producing the product
  as they move forward. At the feedback stage, the designers should have learned
  about the alternative action of the door. It’s unlikely that they desired for
  only one rod to open the door.


  **Principle 3: Conceptual Model**


  The conceptual model—when designed properly—will “lead to understanding and a
  feeling of control.” As consumers, we are naturally inclined to respond best
  to products when we are in control, and the product fulfills our expectations.


  When we feel that something is not in our control, we tend to avoid that
  object or task altogether.


  **Principle 4: Affordances**


  “_Affordance_ refers to the relationship between a physical object and a
  person. E.g., a chair affords (‘is for’) support and, therefore, affords
  sitting.” In our example, there was affording for pulling, but there wasn’t
  affordance for pushing. The next step is to ask “what happened?”


  **Principle 5: Signifiers**


  Affordance and signifiers play off of each other. There needs to be a level of
  intuition to the function of the product. Signifiers are intuitive ways for
  the product to be used by the consumer (i.e. the rods which are pulled to open
  the door). These signifiers “ensure discoverability and will allow for
  feedback to be properly communicated and intelligible.”


  **Principle 6: Mappings**


  The design of the door handle from the State Park was not great but it could
  have been worse. What if there was a rod near the hinges of the door? The door
  will not open, but this will take a long time for the signifiers to catch up
  to the consumer to afford the door to open by pushing on the opposite side of
  the door from the rod. Mapping out the successes and failures of the design
  will help to inform future direction.  


  **Principle 7: Constraints**


  Constraints help “guide actions and interpretation.” Without constraints,
  there is a waste of resources that create a new level of frustration. Keeping
  your product simple and under a constraint (often adhering to convention, i.e.
  a door handle for a public restroom as opposed to a knob) will lead to a
  simple solution to allow the consumer to accomplish his or her goal.

  ### Eliminate the Potential for Human Error


  > "Instead, talk about communication and interaction: what we call an error is
  usually bad communication or interaction."- The Design of Everyday Things,
  page 67


  Norman discusses the interaction and communication between machines and
  humans. Humans tend to have—and I have yet to see a machine have—emotional
  intelligence. So, when operating on the principles of design, a machine and a
  human can work together to produce efficiency, but a human must be able to
  interact with the product emotionally and experimentally in order to eliminate
  design flaws. A human must touch, see, and play with the product under his or
  her own intuitive understanding in order to combat future human error.

  ### Two forms of Innovation: Incremental and Radical


  > "There are two major forms of product innovation: one follows a natural,
  slow evolutionary process; the other is achieved through radical new
  development \[;however,\] the most common and powerful form of \[change\] is
  actually small and incremental."- The Design of Everyday Things, page 279


  When looking back in history, products produced can be seen to have a steady
  progression. A product is made, for example, the steam engine, and over time
  someone says, “I believe there is a better way.” The product goes through
  experimentation and continues to have changes made. Believe it or not, the
  first steam-driven vehicle was built in the 1700s and the first commercial
  vehicle was produced in 1888. Things built normally follow this progression of
  “small and incremental change.”


  However, there are changes in paradigms which come with radical innovation.
  “Radical innovation starts fresh, often driven by new technologies that make
  possible new capabilities.” The second factor in radical change or innovation
  is changing the meaning or narrative that consumers are telling themselves.
  The story must change for radical innovation to occur.
f_conclusion: >-
  Technology is rapidly changing and is starting to make incremental and radical
  innovation throughout our lives. Human beings are social beings that will
  never eliminate the seven principles of design and should be used in everyday
  interactions and the story we tell ourselves. A thorough understanding of the
  principles of design can help us create more compelling products, eliminate
  confusion, and create loyal and engaged customers.

> “Two of the most important characteristics of good design are discoverability and understanding.” _\- The Design of Everyday Things, page 3_

Don Norman is consistently noticing and analyzing how things are made, designed and marketed. At the beginning of _The Design of Everyday Things_ he describes how it is important as a designer to understand business and as a businessman to understand how he or she designs the business’ products; we should add that both the designer and the businessman need to understand the psychology of human interaction.

Norman’s analysis and study have come to the conclusion that when discovering and understanding design there is a human interaction with the everyday products and that design principles have to be met in order for a positive connection to be made between the product and the user. In addition, the user will use his or her experience(s) with the product(s) and make a judgment about the producer of the product.
