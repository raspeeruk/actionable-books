  ### It's My Name, Not Your Name: Making Advanced Reservations


  > "In the bricks-and-mortar world, individuals and companies are investing a
  lot of time and money generating the best name and brand for their business.
  In the online world, it’s just as important to reserve a name for your
  product, brand and/or business across multiple channels."- The Digital Dollar,
  Chapter 1


  I was so happy to read this chapter as it reflected what I have been doing for
  a couple of years now. Who doesn’t like positive reinforcement?!


  We see it almost monthly now where the “next-big-thing” launches online.
  Facebook and Twitter several years ago. Instagram and Pinterest recently
  (recently is an extremely subjective term when describing online) and
  RebelMouse and Vine this year. Typically, it’s first come, first served when
  reserving usernames or sub-domains on these sites. **You need to make sure
  that you register your brand name for these services as soon as you can.**
  Unless your company has a unique name that is truly yours (Nike, Starbucks,
  Costco, etc.) there is a chance that someone else that has the same company
  name will get it before you.


  I have been successful at this with my company, with one exception – Twitter.
  You can find us everywhere at …../BetterBeer. Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram,
  Foursquare, you name it, but not on Twitter where I was too slow, so we are
  BetterBeerCom. Does it confuse people? Maybe not. But having one uniform user
  name on all sites is so consistent and easy to communicate – think of business
  cards and brochures. We have all the icons listed with “BetterBeer” and a
  Twitter handle all by itself. It’s a real pet peeve, to be honest.

  ### Building a Roadmap


  > "Online success is also defined in terms of your intent, and means different
  things based on your business. For many businesses, this means profits and
  returns on digital dollar investments from internet and social media
  activities."- The Digital Dollar, Chapter 10


  As you make your way through the book, Wozny outlines the many strategies that
  you need to use to help your online presence. He puts them all together in the
  last few chapters in what he calls a **Roadmap**. This is your plan/document
  for your internet and social media strategies. Recommended roadmap must haves
  include the following:


  1\. **An articulated vision, business plan or a list of goals you wish to
  accomplish.** Deployment of internet and social programs is an enabler for
  organizational activities, not a business driver; so without business goals
  and objectives, a roadmap has nothing to enable. (Big Point!)


  2\. **The ability to culture and factually audit your existing internet and
  social programs and their performance.** Take a hard look at what is working
  and what is not. Why isn’t it working? How are you measuring it?


  3\. **In general terms, a practical and clear idea of the human and budget
  resources available to allocate to any plans made**, so the planning process
  can make realistic recommendations.


  4\. Not absolutely necessary, but Wozny highly recommends having **access to a
  trusted, knowledgeable, neutral source of information to help answer any
  questions** that may arise around the internet and social media.


  I can completely see the value of the content plan and am in the process of
  building one for all of our social media profiles. I can’t begin to tell you
  how many times I have thought that I _really_ needed to post an update, but
  nothing has come to mind. The pressure of feeling the need to post probably
  didn’t help so I see the value of having content laid out in advance. Once
  that is nailed down, the Roadmap begins.

  ### Please, Please Create a Content Plan


  > "Content plans are never a static document. They must change with the
  availability of information and as timing and priorities change within an
  organization. It is, therefore, advisable to have a single command-and-control
  point for content planning."- The Digital Dollar, Chapter 2


  Many people just bang out a blog or a social media post without giving it much
  thought. With a detailed plan that has content scheduled, you will make sure
  to hit each topic correctly. It also alleviates writer’s block – for those
  times when you know that you should post something, but don’t know what.


  Content plans should contain the following:


  *   What will be published

  *   Which internet channels will be employed and in which locations

  *   When will it be published

  *   Who is responsible for publishing it

  *   Deadlines and lead times required for drafts and reviews – the whole
  publishing process

  *   Major technical events such as an upgrade to the home page of a website
  which could assist or interrupt goals outlined in the content plan


  **Make sure that it is posted on a wall so everyone can see it.** They should
  also include marketing and promotional campaigns, news releases, and public
  appearances.
