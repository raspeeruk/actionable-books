  ### Time out to dream


  > "…people stop dreaming because they got caught up in the hustle and bustle
  of surviving. And once we stop dreaming, we start to lead lives of quiet
  desperation, and little by little the passion and energy begin to disappear
  from our lives."- The Dream Manager, page 26


  The idea of the dream manager is pretty simple: a company hires an individual
  to meet with staff members, discuss their dreams and help them plan to
  accomplish those dreams in a tangible, practical way. A key factor to the
  story is that the company hires a dedicated individual to manage the employees
  dreams – doing so is his sole responsibility.


  If we’re honest with ourselves, we can probably agree to the importance of
  dreams. Dreams motivate us, giving us direction, purpose, confidence and work
  ethic. Our dreams are what make us tick. The challenge isn’t having dreams –
  they may be buried deep down, but we all have ’em. The challenge can often be
  in finding the time to review and articulate those dreams. In the fable, the
  staff of the janitorial company have someone they can go to, once a month, to
  sit down with and discuss their dreams. I humbly suggest that you can do that
  **without** a dream manager.


  This is one of those important things that has no sense of urgency, and
  therefore so often falls by the wayside. You need to take time out to dream.
  Schedule it. Write it in your calendar. Allow yourself an hour this week to
  sit down in a comfortable chair, with a cup of tea or a glass of wine and jot
  down your dreams. It may sound silly, but I can assure you it’s going to be
  one of the best hours of your week. Here’s a couple other tips to help you out
  with the specifics…

  ### Tag team dreams


  > "When we know the dreams of the people around us, we want to help them live
  those dreams."- The Dream Manager, page 130-131


  What are the dreams of the people around you? Have you asked recently? If
  you’re like most people, probably not. It’s so easy to get caught up in the
  details – the mundane aspects of life. Take a ten minute time out over dinner
  tonight to ask the people most important in your life about their dreams. Give
  them the power of making it OK to talk about their dreams. In my experience,
  asking about their dreams will not only make them feel good, but provides you,
  the listener with an incredible energy simply from hearing the dreams of
  others. Few things are more inspiring and energizing than watching and
  listening as people start to open up to you about their dreams, growing in
  excitement as they begin to visualize the accomplishment or attainment of that
  dream in more and more vivid detail. You begin to realize that everyone’s
  different, with different dreams. Even more excitingly, you may also find that
  you can help with their dreams as well.

  ### The dream book


  > "It is not a book of essays. On most pages, there is just one word or one
  phrase or one picture."- The Dream Manager, page 120


  Get yourself a dream book. Virtually every bookstore and stationary shop sells
  journals these days. Pick one up that makes you feel good, and use it to
  record and capture your dreams. There’s something sacred about writing about
  the things you aspire to in a book just a little bit nicer than a notepad.
  This book becomes your reference point, the “go to” spot for writing down new
  dreams and (best part), marking in the dates that you realize those dreams.
  Airplanes, coffee shops and taxi cabs (not to mention your favourite reading
  chair) are all great places to skim through your dream book and update
  accordingly. Take it with you everywhere.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Dream Manager_ is written as a wakeup call to corporate America, but it
  works as a life lesson for us all as well. Dreaming is free, and some of the
  most enjoyable time you can spend. Recording, sharing and planning for the
  accomplishment of those dreams are so simple to do, provided you just allow
  yourself a little regular time to do so. Give it a shot this week and see what
  happens.

What are your dreams? How often do you think about them? As children we all have dreams. Dreams of what we want to become, of what we want to have, of the places we want to go and the things we want to see. In many ways, our dreams define us – they speak to the impact we want to have on the world, and the life we want to lead. In his third book, _The Dream Manager_, Kelly explores the power of articulating and pursuing your dreams. To do so, he uses a fable about a janitorial company and its incredible transformation from a place of high turn-over and low company morale to one of the most sought after places to work in America. The message is simple, clear and timely: by acknowledging, sharing and working proactively to achieve our dreams, we enrich our own lives and the lives of those around us.
