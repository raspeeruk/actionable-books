  ### The Pain of Buyer’s Remorse


  > "Degree-bearing applications have attained the very thing society, their
  parents, their teachers, and everyone else around them told them they needed
  to attain in order to be successful – a credential certifying their
  achievement in academic intelligence. And yet…the comparatively tame recession
  of the early 2000s had hundreds of these BAs, MAs, JDs, PhDs, and MBAs lining
  up for a $10-an-hour shit job posted by a scruffy young business owner without
  a college degree. Is this really the best life advice we can give young
  people?...Shouldn’t we ask ourselves if our advice couldn’t use a bit of
  updating and refining?"- The Education of Millionaires, page 5


  Being unemployed in the midst of the 2008-9 economic recession was tough,
  especially if you were a college student looking for summer employment. As a
  freshman student looking for a job to build up some savings for my sophomore
  year, I was ready to work any job that was reasonably clean, including, yes,
  “a $10-an-hour shit job” that would help me pay my bills.


  The problem: so was everyone else – including those who were down and about
  with university degrees clenched in hand, and soon I was forced to compete
  with laid-off retail sales clerks, financial traders, accountants and truck
  drivers all looking to work in the oft-glorified field of newspaper
  telemarketing, which turned out to be the only type of employer that could
  actually tolerate a high-turnover in its employee base.


  At the time, I remember asking myself why this was the case; why was I rubbing
  shoulders with a new graduate in accounting and a seasoned retail sales clerk
  who had studied HR and psychology more than 10 years ago in university –
  wouldn’t they be able to find a job elsewhere, given their degree and
  experiences?


  It was all rather grim, but as I stood in line desperately waiting for an
  interview, I reflected on all the career advice that I’d been given throughout
  my childhood, and realized that most of it, while well-intentioned, was
  certainly out of place, and definitely out of its time.


  Was university-based education failing to prepare us for the real-world?

  ### Refocusing our Lenses


  > "What would education for a successful life look like? You can define a
  “success” any way you want – wealth; career; family; spirituality; sense of
  meaning and purpose; vibrant health; service and contribution to community,
  nation, and humanity – or any combination thereof. What would an education
  look like that was laser-targeted only toward achieving these real-world
  results, and zealously cut out all bullshit not directly related to living a
  happy, successful life and making a powerful contributing to the lives of the
  people around you?"- The Education of Millionaires, page 9


  If you haven’t figured this out by now, a college education is not a necessary
  precondition for career success. And if you didn’t believe this just by seeing
  how many college dropouts turned out to be millionaires and billionaires, take
  a look at doctors and lawyers (or any accredited professionals for that
  matter). Any of these professionals would not be able to practice their
  professions without having a college degree (or few) behind them, and in fact,
  it isn’t that degree that really makes a good lawyer or doctor stand out, as
  much as it is their _ability_ to stand out – their soft skills, marketing and
  sales skills, customer service skills, and networks (both of people, and ideas
  and concepts and new developments within their industry).


  In fact, Ellsberg identifies 7 success skills that everyone needs to develop
  if they want to succeed in the real-world:


  1) Finding ways to make your work meaningful – actively finding ways to stop
  it from going stale  

  2) Finding great mentors and building a great network  

  3) The fundamentals of marketing  

  4) The fundamentals of selling  

  5) The Art of Bootstrapping (or investing your money successfully)  

  6) Building your personal brand within your industry  

  7) Developing an entrepreneurial mindset – how to become a hustler and
  brilliant executor, under fire


  But then again, these “practical skills are not intended to be a replacement
  for college” (page 7), and a person who can combine the benefits of a
  university education with these skills will truly stand out in their field.


  Here’s what it boils down to: once you figure out what “success” means to you,
  your task is now to match your work as closely as possible to this vision of
  success. This book basically provides you with a general framework of the 7
  key factors that all successful people – from Sean Parker to David Gilmour (of
  Pink Floyd), Jean Paul Dejoria to Mark Ecko (of Ecko Unlimited clothing) –
  share, leaving it up to you to fill in the specifics with your particular
  interests and experiences.


  In a narrative that criss-crosses America’s business landscape while making
  brief pitstops at various points in the author’s life, and crammed with
  interviews with some of today’s top entrepreneurs and high-rollers (many of
  whom are household names), Ellsberg shows us just how easy it is to work for
  ourselves, doing things that matter to us and which really interest us.


  _“I hope this book has inspired at least a few disobedient thoughts._”

  ### A Little Misunderstanding


  > "…education is most certainly not the same thing as academic excellence.
  We’ve conflated them, at great cost to ourselves, our children, our economy,
  and our culture. And, while education is always necessary for success,
  pursuing academic excellence is not in all cases."- The Education of
  Millionaires, page 11


  So how did we end up in this situation?


  It’s likely that the education system that we have right now is a relic of the
  19th century, where grades might have been emphasized as a the leading
  indicator of success – and hence the most emphasized focus of all our
  attention, energy and value – because the system was built to mimic the
  rigours of the industry that it was training graduates for. Industrial
  positions largely consisted of jobs in bureaucracy and management, and in both
  cases success was largely measured scientifically in terms of one’s ability to
  achieve and perform with respect to pre-set productivity and efficiency
  targets. And what is a grade if not a measured achievement target?


  The education system was set up to standardize knowledge and take children off
  the streets, but in the process it tended to produce bureaucrats. The problem
  is today, industry needs more than just bureaucracy, but the education system
  has been slow to play catch-up.


  So the question is: can we escape our self-imposed system of thoughts, beliefs
  and conventions about education, and figure out what it takes to acquire a
  successful education?

  "You can learn many wonderful things in college. You can be exposed to new
  ideas, broaden your perspective on life, learn critical thinking skills, and
  immerse yourself in the great intellectual and cultural treasures of the human
  mind and spirit. But, even if you’ve already gone through college, one thing
  I’m certain wasn’t on the curriculum in school was how to translate these
  abstract, academic teachings into real-world results in your own life. Yet,
  this additional education around practical skills is not optional. Learning
  the skills in this book well is a necessary addition to a college education,
  if you want to achieve more success in your work and life. This book shows you

This book is guaranteed to light a fire under your ass.

If you’re reading this article, chances are you’re probably pursuing a post-secondary degree, or have already done so, and have spent at least $40,000 (supported by student loans) funding your education just to be able to graduate from an accredited university with knowledge, skills and experience in a particular discipline.

Now ask yourself, are you currently working a job that is directly related to your choice of academic study? How well does your career reflect the effort that you put in at university?  
If you’re an entrepreneur, a consultant, a lawyer, engineer, accountant, doctor, scientist or marketer (or anything else for that matter), how did you get your job? Was it because you could do what you do very well, or was it because you were, additionally, very good at _marketing_ and _selling_ the fact that you could do what you do, very well?

That’s the question this book essentially tries to address. And if you’re willing to entertain for a moment that in order to succeed, it takes more than just a solid knowledge of your field, then you’re in the right place, because that’s the truth.

A romp of a read, Michael Ellsberg’s “The Education of Millionaires” should be required reading for all students, entrepreneurs, teachers, professors and career professionals. It also makes an excellent field manual and stocking stuffer for you to turn to when you need advice on how to open and close a sale, connect with mentors, find meaning in your work, or in general figure out how to develop a soft skill that will help you take your career forward, and which university failed to teach you.
