  ### Reduce the amount effort it takes to do business with you


  > "We pick companies because of their products, but often leave them because
  of their service failures."- The Effortless Experience, page 23


  The truth is, customers don’t call you when everything is fine. They call you
  when they need your help and this is the moment when their loyalty is most
  likely to be impacted. The authors’ research shows these interactions are four
  times more likely to drive disloyalty instead of increasing a customer’s
  loyalty. Four times – that’s a big number!


  One of the ways in which companies are making it easier for customers to solve
  their own problems is self-service. Contrary to popular belief, **sometimes
  your customers don’t want to talk to you.** Rather than feel insulted, think
  of these examples:


  *   When you need to withdraw money from your bank account, do you approach
  the bank teller or use the ATM?

  *   On your last vacation, did you wait in line at the airport to check in? Or
  did you use a self-serve kiosk? Or print your boarding pass at home?


  Leading companies are making it easy to help customers help themselves – and
  are rewarded by increased loyalty.


  However, self-service isn’t for everyone. There will always be customers who
  want to pick up the phone and speak to a live representative and even the best
  self-service options can’t solve complex customer problems. So what happens
  next when a customer calls in?

  ### Focus on the overall customer service experience


  > "Bake a cake, don’t just focus on individual ingredients."- The Effortless
  Experience, page 191


  By now you might be wondering how you can motivate your team to create a
  low-effort experience for your customers. Customer service representatives
  have historically been marked on a checklist basis. “Did you greet the
  customer?” Check. “Did you empathize with them?” Check. “Did you ask if there
  was anything else you could help them with today?” Check. The problem with
  this approach is that it focuses on the “ingredients” instead of the big
  picture, the effortless experience. It’s likely that a customer service
  representative could do everything right by a checklist, but still fall short
  of an effortless experience from the viewpoint of the customer. And let’s face
  it, checklists work well when you’re faced with routine inquiries, not when
  addressing a complex customer issue.


  In order to provide a low-effort experience to customers with complex issues,
  there are five main areas you need to focus on. But no scripts here – just
  empowering customer service reps to embrace the following principles and
  providing coaching and encouragement as they do:


  1) **Engage the customer** – use a professional, courteous and engaging tone


  2) **Identify their needs** – practice active listening and ask questions to
  clarify


  3) **Offer relevant options** – give the customer a few choices that are
  relevant to their needs


  4) **Inform the customer** – take on the role of expert by sharing relevant
  information with the customer to help them make their choice easier


  5) **Show commitment** – let the customer know what actions you have taken,
  how these actions support their needs, and play the advocate by letting them
  know what you can do for them instead of what you cannot

  ### Be positive and understand the real issue


  > "Just because there’s nothing you can do, doesn’t mean there’s nothing you
  can do."- The Effortless Experience, page 91


  No one likes telling a customer “No” and no customer likes hearing “No”, but
  sometimes that is the answer. What if there was another way to say “No” that
  your customers could accept? Even like? The authors share ways in which
  companies are saying “No” but still ensuring a positive experience for
  customers.


  The first is using positive language. Your first instinct is that you can’t
  honour the customer request, but that’s no reason to say “No”. Instead, focus
  on what you can do. For example:


  Instead of, “There are no appointments available this week”, say “I have an
  opening next week”.


  Instead of, “Your order won’t be ready today”, say “Your order will be ready
  tomorrow morning”.


  It comes down to not what you say, but how you say it. Another way in which
  companies are improving the customer experience is by understanding the
  context of the request. A customer’s stated request is not always the real
  issue. A customer might call a bakery to inquire if they are open Friday
  nights. If the front line staff member answers “No”, or even if they use
  positive language and say, “We are open until 5pm”, they might be missing the
  real reason the customer is calling. Let’s imagine in this case, the customer
  wants to pick up a cake for their daughter’s birthday on Saturday. If the
  front line staff were to inquire and find this out, they could take the cake
  design request over the phone and advise that delivery on Saturday morning was
  an option. Now instead of “No”, they have a new order and have simultaneously
  made getting a last-minute birthday cake easy.

  Experience_. Not only does it cover the above areas in more depth, it includes
  resources that you can use to guide you in reducing the effort customers
  perceive when interacting with your business.

> "I live in a small town with only one steakhouse. The steak there is fine. But the minute a new restaurant opens, you bet I’ll go there. So am I satisfied? Sure. Loyal? No way." _\- The Effortless Experience, page 19_

_The Effortless Experience_ investigates what drives customer loyalty – and disloyalty. What they find runs contrary to what many of us believe to be true. Research shows that going above and beyond for a customer has minimal impact on their loyalty. The customer might say they are “extremely satisfied” with your service, but it won’t make them more loyal in the long run. **What customers today are looking for is an “effortless experience” and they reward the companies that are able to provide this experience with their loyalty.**

We’ve all had a high effort experience – searching a company website for an answer to your problem, calling customer service and waiting in queue, getting transferred from one department to another, and finally escalating your call to a supervisor to get your issue resolved. How do you feel after this experience? Exhausted? Me too! Likely to recommend the company to a friend? Nope. Willing to consider another provider? You bet.

So how are companies creating low-effort service for their customers? They’re putting systems in place to allow customers to help themselves. They’re finding out the real issue – not just the customer’s stated request. They’re engineering the customer experience to reduce perceived effort. And, they’re empowering their front line employees to make it happen.
