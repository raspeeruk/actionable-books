  ### Chicken Cordon-bleu Makes a Terrible Chicken Nugget


  > "Howard Gardner has argued to wide acclaim that we have not one but multiple
  intelligences. They include linguistic, musical, mathematical, spatial,
  kinesthetic, interpersonal (relationships with others), and intra-personal
  (knowledge and understanding of the self) intelligence."- The Element, page 43


  ‘IQ’ and other standardized testing may be the singular most crippling tool on
  our future. I love Robinson’s comparison of standardized testing to Fast Food.
  When you order fast food, you always know exactly what you’re going to get.
  It’s reliable. Not good for you, not enriching, but reliable. If the chicken
  nugget comes out the right size, right temperature, and with the proper amount
  of batter, it gets served. If not, it get’s put back through the system or
  tossed out with the trash. A beautifully prepared chicken cordon-bleu does not
  pass chicken nugget standardized testing. When we use one form of measurement
  at the exclusion of all others, we marginalize and disregard other forms of
  brilliance.


  More and more research studies are proving that human beings have multiple
  forms of intelligence. But we don’t really need studies to prove this to us –
  we know it inherently already. Some people are naturally gifted athletes. A
  couple of our friends may be more “emotionally intelligent”; able to determine
  the root of a disagreement or cause of pain before the rest of us. My good
  friend Sean has a brilliant musical ear – writes fantastic songs, and is
  virtually self taught.


  So what does an IQ test teach us? For a great many people, it teaches
  (incorrectly) that they are dumb. Since the only tests we use in education are
  one dimensional (focusing on math, science or language), there’s nothing to
  refute the results (I’m dumb), and we go through life believing it to be true.
  If science has shown us that there are many different types of intelligence,
  why do we insist on testing only one?


  Sir Ken Robinson suggests that if you’re not happy in our current role in
  life, it may be because you haven’t yet found your “Element” – that place
  where natural aptitude meets passion; you haven’t yet identified that natural
  intelligence that you do have. And everyone has something. (If you believe you
  don’t, there’s a good chance you haven’t “recovered” from your formal
  education yet)


  Whether it becomes our full time career, or a recreational activity, Robinson
  believes passionately (as do I) that finding your Element and deliberately
  including it in your life will lead to a happier, fuller existence.

  ### Find Your Tribe


  > "Finding your tribe can have transformative effects on your sense of
  identity and purpose. This is because of three powerful tribal dynamics:
  validation, inspiration, and what we'll call here the 'alchemy of synergy."-
  The Element, page 114


  Before he became the legend he is today, Bob Dylan had to move from his home
  town of Minnesota to New York City and experience Woody Gunthrie records. Meg
  Ryan was terrified of public speaking until she moved to LA and met her acting
  coach. Surrounding ourselves with the people that “get” what makes us tick –
  people that share our passions and aptitudes – is a huge step to finding your
  Element. The right people will challenge us, encourage us, and inspire us to
  live and play in our Element. You need to get out there – to sign up for
  courses, classes, volunteer groups, whatever. If you’re drawn to a particular
  activity, industry or discipline, try it out. We all spent 12 – 20 years being
  indoctrinated with the belief that a lot of activities are “silly” or
  “pointless”. We need to get over that. You need to take the first step, by
  reaching out to people who are already doing it. Then, let the tribe inspire
  and push you to live in your element as much as you can.


  The theme here is active participation. Until the education system is
  overhauled to the purpose of identifying and cultivating individual
  intelligences, it’s on us, as individuals, to actively seek out that which
  makes us most satisfied in life. We can’t wait around for “luck” to sneak up
  on us and present us with our perfect form of happiness.

  ### Seek Out Flow


  > "'The key element of an optimal experience,' he says in Flow, 'is that it is
  an end in itself. Even if initially undertaken for other reasons, the activity
  that consumes us becomes intrinsically rewarding.'"- Dr. Mihaly
  Csikszentmihalyi, as quoted in The Element, page 92


  We discussed Flow when we looked at Daniel Pink’s recent success,
  [Drive](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/drive/). Quite coincidently, I
  find myself revisiting the topic in The Element. Perhaps it’s not so
  coincidental after all, when you consider that Pink and Robinson are both
  tackling the same issue from different directions – we need to figure out (and
  quickly) how to succeed as individuals and as a society within the new rules
  of business in the 21st century.


  A recap for those who missed the Drive article (which you can find
  [HERE](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/drive/), by the way): Flow – a term
  coined by Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi – is the state we’ve all been in at one
  point or another where the task we’re engrossed in becomes all consuming.
  (It’s also often referred to as being “in the zone”) We lose track of time and
  sense of self, becoming solely fixated on the task at hand. It’s a wonderful
  state, and one which most of us don’t enjoy nearly often enough.


  Flow is the signal you’re in your element. Be aware of it. When you realize
  you’ve been engrossed in a certain activity, reflect on it. (TV, by the way,
  is not an activity, ACTIVE being the core of the word. TV is a “passivity”)
  What aspects of what you were doing excite you? Taking inventory of these may
  give you a list of indicators as to what your Element might be.

Think about this fact: In 2004, there were more unemployed college graduates than there were unemployed high school dropouts. This could potentially be construed as a positive thing, if it meant that the number of high school dropouts had declined drastically but, unfortunately, this is not the [case](* http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2002/droppub_2001/). Instead, the simplified truth is this: With a post secondary degree these days, you have roughly the same likelihood of finding a job as a high school dropout. How could this be?

Competition. Global competition for jobs has increased dramatically over the past 30 years. The world’s population has doubled in the past 40 years, and with it so have the number of applicants for the same number of jobs. Average doesn’t cut it when there are 35 people clamouring for the same job. If you want to be visible in your field, you need to be exceptional. We all have the power to be exceptional. We all have unique strengths and skills that we can utilize to thrive in a field that fills us with passion, purpose and energy.

Unfortunately, as Sir Ken Robinson (of the “[School Kills Creativity](https://essays.edubirdie.com/blog/ken-robinson-how-schools-kill-creativity)” video fame) points out in his brilliant book _The Element_, our current education system is only training us to excel in a chosen few. If you don’t fit the mold of math, science or language, a traditional education system may not lead to the fulfilling life you’d once imagined.
