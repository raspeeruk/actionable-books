  ### Your Definition of Success Determines Your Systems


  > "First, decide what kind of success you want to create and then decide how
  much time, energy and effort you are willing to put into achieving it."- The
  Entrepreneur’s Trap, page 5


  Although Forsyth never fully articulates this, she implies that our concepts
  and ideas about running a business are backward. Most often, you continually
  go through the necessary motions to keep things running and assume success
  will follow. **Yet we fail to define what success personally means to us.** It
  ends up being this elusive thing that we are constantly chasing, but never
  fully grasp. Of course, one of the benefits of entrepreneurship is that you
  can choose to define things on your own terms.


  **Forsyth suggests starting with understanding why you started your
  business.** “Your why becomes the touchstone for making decisions about how to
  run your business”. Most often your why will be related to freedom, money or
  meaning. After you establish what’s important to you, it is far easier to
  determine a business model and offers that support this.

  ### Do the Work You Love


  > "It’s not just about working, it’s about doing the work you love."- The
  Entrepreneur’s Trap, page 85


  This idea goes back to the The Big Idea of this book. While there are certain
  tasks and responsibilities that come with running a business, it is necessary
  to say no or learn how to delegate. Forsyth suggests that rekindling the
  reason why you started the business in order to determine what your role
  really is. What is it that you wanted to _do_?


  In order to shift your focus to what you love to do and avoid a sinking ship
  situation, there are two things that need to be in place.


  *   **Systems** – These allow you to create a business that functions
  smoothly, effectively and freely rather than having to spend all of your time
  putting out fires and trying to keep up. Good systems will also allow you to
  leverage the growth of your business. This comes down to centralizing and
  automating as much as possible. Forsyth lists the top ten business systems as
  – backup, money, scheduling, communication, metrics, marketing, relationships,
  sales, delivery and business foundation systems.

  *   **Support** – take the time to really figure out what help you need and
  find someone who is the best fit for the job. This process requires stepping
  into a leadership role and being okay with delegation. Forsyth points out that
  this is a powerful process in building faith and trust that will allow your
  business to flourish.

  ### Work Expands to Fill the Time Available


  > "…give yourself a deadline or a time frame in which to do the work and you
  will make it happen."- The Entrepreneur’s Trap, page 46


  **Regardless of whether or not you are an entrepreneur, there is a tendency to
  “always be working” these days.** Whether it’s mindlessly checking email on a
  Saturday afternoon, or working on a project late Friday night, there are a
  gamut of ways that we have unnecessarily intertwined work with our personal
  lives. Forsyth is a proponent of having “non-working hours” and with good
  reason. **There are numerous articles and studies that suggest creativity,
  productivity and overall happiness increase with free time.** She suggests
  laying down the law by giving yourself deadlines for projects and setting
  non-working hours. Just as Parkinson’s Law suggests, the work will expand (or
  contract) to fit the allotted time.


  While there are a number of tips suggested for creating the boundaries, the
  one I thought was the most interesting is simply having something more
  compelling to do. It seems that having hobbies or activities we enjoy doing
  outside of work have become a thing of the past.

  I noticed many parallels between _The Entrepreneur’s Trap_ and Tim Ferriss’
  [_The Four Hour Work
  Week_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-4-hour-workweek/) in
  terms of their ideology. But I think that Forsyth’s approach is far more
  realistic and pragmatic for someone in the trenches. It’s a clear and helpful
  approach to get your head above water and starting living the life _you_ want.

> "Running the business is not the fun and sexy side of entrepreneurship, but it is essential to your success and sanity." _\- The Entrepreneur’s Trap, page ii_

I left my full-time job as a non-profit fundraiser back in March to begin running my own business full-time. In the weeks and days leading up to the big leap, I had many ideas and dreams about what my life would be like as an entrepreneur. Leisurely mornings reading the paper and sipping tea. Time for running. Working at my own pace. Freedom. Yes, freedom. But as anyone who has run their own business knows, it’s not like this at all! While I won’t deny that it’s rewarding, it comes with a lot of responsibility, which Tina Forsyth claims often leaves entrepreneurs in a reactive rather than proactive state.

In her book _The Entrepreneur’s Trap_, **Tina Forsyth gives her readers a dose of reality and demonstrates how most (like me) are vastly underprepared to really run a business.** Things like scheduling, client relations, customer service, bookkeeping and more come with the territory and contribute to the business being a well-oiled machine. But, as Forsyth points out, these are the things that tend to stress business owners out. These things take up time, money and effort that can contribute to low returns – what Forsyth deems “The Entrepreneur’s Trap.”

How do you define _your_ success? If this is not something you’ve done in the past, do you think having a definition will change the way you work?
