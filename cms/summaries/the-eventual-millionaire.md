  ### Make Money Money, Make Money Money


  > "After you become a millionaire, you can give all of your money away because
  what’s important is not the million dollars; what’s important is the person
  you have become in the process of becoming a millionaire."- Jim Rohn, as
  quoted in The Eventual Millionaire, page 5


  **Want a million bucks in your bank account?** _Duh._


  Don’t let the 6 zeros intimidate you. Many of the millionaires featured in
  _The Eventual Millionaire_ started from scratch and refused to let obstacles
  stand in their way. Kane Minkus went from being a homeless musician to a
  multimillion-dollar business coach. And Lewis Howes went from being an injured
  professional football player without a college degree (and sleeping on his
  sister’s couch) to running a million-dollar online business.


  How did they do it? And more importantly, how can you do it?


  **Numero uno:** **If you want a million bucks, don’t be an ass donkey.** And
  don’t be afraid to ask for help. Patience, vulnerability, and accountability
  are vital to gaining your bootay.

  ### Start a Mastermind Group


  > "Make sure to invite people to the group who you think are much more
  successful than you."- The Eventual Millionaire, page 108


  Whatever you do, make sure you’re not the smartest person in your mastermind
  group. If you want to achieve your goals, you need the accountability,
  support, resources and best practices from A-list thought leaders.


  I used to think mastermind groups were just a fad. Sure, you can pay a lot of
  money to meet weekly with other entrepreneurs but what would come out of it?
  Lots of chest pounding, right? _Wrong._


  Apparently, I’ve been the ass. The majority of millionaires Jaime Tardy has
  interviewed have claimed their success was in large part due to their
  mastermind groups. Noted.


  _The good news?_ You can create a mastermind group too, even if you don’t have
  the money to join a fancy _schmancy_ one.


  Here’s a step-by-step guide to starting a mastermind group:


  1.  **Find potential members.** List 10 people in your extended network who
  you don’t know yet but would be ideal for your group. Reach out until 4-8
  people commit to your group, depending on the group size you prefer.

  2.  **Establish _Mastermind Guidelines_ for the group.** This could include
  anything from establishing the meeting time and length each week to the goals
  of the group. An example from the book: “The mastermind is not just for
  advice, but it also becomes a positive place where you can manifest your goals
  with a group.”

  3.  **Create a _Mastermind Agenda_**_._ Here’s an example from the book:


  **12:00pm** Welcome  

  **12:05pm** Sharing a “win” from the previous week  

  **12:20pm** Hot Seat – one member. _What are you working on? What’s working
  for you? With what do you need help?_  

  **12:40pm** Last questions. _Who can help (member) with their problem?_  

  **12:50pm** Resource  

  **12:55pm** State your goal for the next week  

  **1:00pm** End

  ### Don’t Be a Donkey


  > "There’s a parable of a donkey that is exactly equi-distant between two
  buckets of water; one is 30 feet to the left, one is 30 feet to the right. He
  keeps looking left, looking right, keeps looking at both buckets, can’t decide
  because they both look equally appealing and eventually he falls over and dies
  of thirst."- The Eventual Millionaire, page 78


  Are we _that_ different from the ass in this parable? We want to “do it all”
  and we want it all right now. How about we commit to honoring the donkey and
  not making the unfortunate mistake he made?


  Here’s how we avoid dehydration.


  **One.** Give yourself permission to want _and_ seek a dozen different career
  paths. The days of working in one job for 40 years are over. That’s right –
  you can be a teacher, chef, consultant, zookeeper, public speaker and novelist
  in one lifetime _if_ that is what your inner-donkey desires.


  After all, ninety-one percent of Millennials expect to stay in a job for less
  than three years, according to the Future Workplace “Multiple Generations @
  Work” survey. That translates to 15 – 20 jobs over the course of their working
  lives!


  **Number Two.** This is an important one: **Create your life plan.** Jaime
  Tardy recommends you:


  1.) Grab a piece of paper,


  2.) Draw a line in the middle,


  3.) Write your age at the far left,


  4.) Write five-year increments, and


  5.) Place one idea in each section.


  It turns out you DO have time to wear all the hats you’d like to during your
  lifetime. Assuming you don’t get hit by a car tomorrow. And don’t forget the
  most important part…


  **Number Three.** Be patient. The tiniest steps forward make the biggest
  difference. Use millionaire Brig Hart as an example: _“I discipline myself to
  do those things that cause progressive growth every day mentally, physically,
  and financially. I’d work out every day. I’d read a little bit every day. I’d
  encourage myself every day. I made contacts. I did my little bit every day.”
  He says, “Input equals output.”_


  **Input equals output, indeed.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Of course there are a ton of variables that feed into whether or not you can
  achieve million-dollar status. And maybe you don’t event want millions of
  dollars (good for you!). Regardless, this book reminded me that there are
  people – not that different from you or me – that are setting the bar high and
  reaching their goals. It is possible.

**Do you rendezvous with millionaires often?** Yea, I didn’t think so.

Jaime Tardy, author of _The Eventual Millionaire_, decided to not only befriend hundreds of millionaires but also pick their brains via her weekly podcast. The interviews turned into a book and the book turned into this summary. Bam.

**So let’s talk about the money, _money_, money.**

Since she was a little girl Jaime knew she wanted to be a millionaire, but by the time she was 22 years old she found herself burdened with $70,000 of debt, along with a house, pool, 2 new cars, and oodles of other material possessions. Jaime knew she had to make a drastic change and eliminate all debt before she could focus on building a new career and lifestyle and earning her first million.

Elevating her game would require focus along with the insight from and support of other savvy thought leaders. But enough about Jaime. _What about you?_ Are you ready to elevate your game and make a million? _Cha-ching._
