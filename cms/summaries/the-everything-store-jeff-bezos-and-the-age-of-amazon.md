  ### Never Lose Sight of Who You Are and What You Stand For


  > "Rudeness is not cool. Defeating tiny guys is not cool. Close-following is
  not cool. Young is cool. Risk taking is cool. Winning is cool. Polite is cool.
  Defeating bigger, unsympathetic guys is cool. Inventing is cool. Explorers are
  cool. Conquerors are not cool. Obsessing over competitors is not cool.
  Empowering others is cool. Capturing all the value only for the company is not
  cool. Leadership is cool. Conviction is cool. Straightforwardness is cool.
  Pandering to the crowd is not cool. Hypocrisy is not cool. Authenticity is
  cool. Thinking big is cool. The unexpected is cool. Missionaries are cool.
  Mercenaries are not cool."- The Everything Store, page 175


  At the point Amazon had reached over $100 billion in sales, Bezos was forced
  to sit down, take a look his business’s reputation and what sort of perception
  he had created. In an effort to sort out his thoughts, he often takes to
  creating handwritten memos, lists and spreadsheets to organize his thoughts
  and goals.


  On this particular occasion, he took a hard look at the strengths and weakness
  of Amazon along with many of the attributes of large, renowned companies and
  formulated the above list, which turned out to be a blueprint for how he
  envisioned Amazon to remain not only competitive, but set itself apart from
  other (competitive) retailers. His aim? Not different from the early start-up
  days, was ensure Amazon’s **pdds** of standing out from the masses. Each
  simple statement was meant to be an attainable goal which each employee could
  incorporate into practice and feel a sense of success, both on an individual
  and corporate level.

  ### Reinventing Your Business Model Without Completely Renegotiating It


  > "Size bred chaos. All companies hit this critical moment, when their
  internal structures, like a teenager’s old shoes, suddenly don’t fit anymore.
  But Amazon went through a severe form of this rite of passage. The larger and
  more ambitious it got, the more complicated it became structurally and the
  harder it was to keep everyone coordinated and moving quickly. Bezos wanted to
  execute several strategies simultaneously, but the company’s various
  interdependent divisions were wasting too much time coordinating with one
  other."- The Everything Store, page 91


  One of the promises many start-ups and dot.com businesses make is the
  assurance that they will be the company who never lays off its employees and
  never loses sight of each employee’s individualism. Suddenly, having grown
  larger than Bezos or the rest of management could have ever imagined, he was
  forced to take a hard look at the unimaginable growth and success of Amazon.
  Bezos was forced with the decision that many successful entrepreneurs have to
  make: is it more important to stand by it’s initial formula to recognize each
  employee as an individual or to have the company recognize each consumer as an
  individual? Upon taking a hard look, Bezos found the perfect way to strike a
  balance between both. While making decisions on new initiatives, he continued
  to incorporate his staff into the decision-making process. He holds
  company-wide meetings to present the suggestions of Amazon’s clientele to it’s
  staff and ultimately makes decisions based on what will please consumers
  without undermining the desire of employees. **Every voice that speaks out, is
  heard.**

  ### Never Allow Cynics to Change Your Mind


  > "Though they could not have known it, investors were looking at the
  opportunity of a lifetime. This highly driven, articulate young man talked
  with conviction about the Internet’s potential to deliver a more convenient
  shopping experience than crowded big-box stores where the staff routinely
  ignored customers. He predicted the company’s eventual ability to personalize
  a version of the website for each shopper based on his or her previous
  purchases. And he prophesied what must have seemed like a radical future: that
  everyone would one day use the Internet at high speeds, not over screeching
  dialup modems, and that the infinite shelf space of the Web would enable the
  fulfillment of the merchandiser’s dream of the everything store—a store with
  infinite selection."- The Everything Store, page 27


  Early on, Jeff Bezos knew he had a cutting edge, state-of-the-art business and
  well architected business on his hands. Convincing investors without a
  seemingly desperate tone was the key to getting the venture capital he needed
  to transition his ideas in reality. When meeting with investors, he was able
  to strike a balance between his own grandiose dreams and the possible reality
  of future online business so eloquently that he obtained the funding he needed
  and remained true to fulfilling the expectations he had promised his angel
  investors. Bezos has never taken for granted the initial days of proving
  himself to investors and the public and continues to carry through every new
  venture, just as he did in the days on Amazon’s infancy.

  While it is often difficult to take the personal account of one man or one
  company’s successes and translate it into a global message, I believe _The
  Everything Store_ does a wonderful job of encouraging small business owners
  and entrepreneurs that **the key to success is to set goals, stick to your
  ideals, refuse to compromise on quality and to keep persevering.** When taking
  an analytical look at experiences and global success of Amazon, it is without
  a doubt possible to apply the universal truths of Amazon’s successes to nearly
  all businesses, great or small, online or not. The most important reminder?
  Success should not be counted by dollars and cents – but by continuing to
  exist and grow without sacrificing the ideals and value of your
  products/services.

  "Each order during those early months brought a thrill to Amazon’s employees.
  When someone made a purchase, a bell would ring on Amazon’s computers, and
  everyone in the office would gather around to see if anyone knew the customer.
  (It was only a few weeks before it started ringing so often that they had to
  turn it off.)"

> "Each order during those early months brought a thrill to Amazon’s employees. When someone made a purchase, a bell would ring on Amazon’s computers, and everyone in the office would gather around to see if anyone knew the customer. (It was only a few weeks before it started ringing so often that they had to turn it off.)" _\- The Everything Store, page 24_

Amazon.com, just like every successful start-up, started on a shoestring budget with a small, family-like small business staff. **Every success was celebrated, no matter how small or large.** It is this mentality, one of prolonged and regular encouragement from the management team, that has kept Amazon’s goals, achievements and expectations attainable.

Upper management, including Jeff Bezos himself, has never let go of the the importance of creating a personal relationship with his entire staff – often still sitting in during the new-hire process. A large portion of the company’s success is attributed to the fact that regardless of its growth, it has always remained personalized and individually catered to its employees and customers, which Brad Stone chronicles in _The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon_. A practice I have always found fundamental to the success of my own business (as the creator of several custom start-ups) is to allow each customer/client to feel that I work solely for them and that the are my most important client – much like the mantra of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.
