  ### Bring your Whole Self to the Game


  > "If you try to keep your most sacred ambitions off of your calendar and your
  most genuine traits off of your resume, then you’re missing out on the power
  of real integrity."- The Fire Starter Sessions, xxvii


  **When’s the last time you celebrated your idiosyncratic-isms?** _It’s been a
  while, eh?_


  We live in a world where it is normal to Photoshop our eccentricities out of
  photos and relationships. We hide weaknesses. We gloss over insecurities. In
  the workplace especially, we cover up tattoos with Oxford shirts, steer clear
  of controversial conversations that may close doors, and worst of all, we hide
  our true passions – right under the dusty fax machine. _Who faxes nowadays
  anyway?_


  **Your contradictions make you gorgeously multidimensional.** If you want to
  live boldly and spherically, take your whole self into the future, without
  hiding integral elements of your life – your faith, your scars, your light.


  As Danielle says beautifully, “When we integrate all of the aspects of our
  beings, we expand. Cosmic love _and_ worldly ambition, consciousness _and_
  cash, high standards _and_ compassion – this is where it all comes together.”


  So how do you show up in the office? What about your home? If you’re showing
  up as two different people, you may be hiding pieces of your whole self.

  ### Choosing Ease


  > "The easy way is a direction that leads to spacious places."- The Fire
  Starter Sessions, page 78


  **No pain, no gain, right?** That’s what I always believed until reading this
  enlightened lesson.


  If you’re hitting a ginormous brick wall every single time you work on project
  _X_, maybe it just isn’t into you. In other words, if you have to try really
  hard to be good at something, you’ll never hit Rockstar levels of success.
  **And isn’t that what we are all aiming for?**


  If you follow the metric of ease and tap into your true strengths, you will
  have the ability to feel powerful and create work of mammoth proportions.
  **Let it be easy.** Allow your energy to focus on the work, not the battle.
  Ask yourself these questions: Does this come easily to me? Or, does this make
  me feel weak? These questions will guide your work and daily purpose.


  Of course, this philosophy does not give you permission to slack off and watch
  reruns of _Seinfeld_ on the couch – just because it’s easy. You still need to
  work your buns off on the work that matters, the work that makes you stronger,
  the work that will make a difference.

  ### Crushing Competency


  > "If it doesn’t light you up, you’re not the right person for the job."- The
  Fire Starter Sessions, page 23


  **I used to believe that being well-rounded equaled mega success.** I was even
  voted _Best All Around_ in high school because that’s what I thought mattered
  the most. _Barf._


  Let’s be real. If you are “good” at something, it doesn’t mean you should
  saturate your life with it. And if you’re reading these words, you’re probably
  good at many things. Maybe you’ve even tricked yourself into believing you
  enjoy the work you’re good at doing. After all, your boss goes gaga over your
  analytics reports so maybe you should learn to love data…


  It’s an easy trap to fall into and can lead down a dark path far distant from
  the actual things that make you feel like a supernova. Like writing. Or
  cluster ballooning. Or problem solving. _You get the idea._


  Letting go of our need to be competent in multiple areas of our lives is the
  first step needed to move closer to our true calling. **How many tasks that
  you’re “good” at completing (even though they infuriate you) can you
  eliminate?** Even if you can’t outsource all of these elements in your life,
  at least stop striving for perfection in them. As Danielle used to tell her
  staff, **“Be careful what you’re good at – you could end up doing it for
  years.”**


  Allow yourself to unabashedly shine in the core areas that truly make you feel
  electric. Ditch the rest. Be ridiculously inept at Excel. Stop trying to act
  like Martha Stewart even though entertaining makes you want to curl into the
  fetal position. Allow yourself to burn lasagna … and then laugh about it, of
  course.


  **But push, push, push forward with your desires.** Your passions. Your light.
  If you’re used to the well-rounded life, this new drive and perspective will
  lead you into unchartered territory: **the new masterful you.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Yes, crushing competency and choosing ease are important, but there are
  numerous other valuable lessons in this book that have resonated with me. They
  will probably resonate with you as well.

**Every fire needs some heat … _you ready to turn up the temperature?_**

Before _The Fire Starter Sessions_ was crafted, the original Fire Starter, writer, and business strategist Danielle LaPorte, spread her spark o’ genius by convening with fellow freedom seekers in living rooms, boardrooms, and even pole dancing studios across North America to discuss the collision of business and the creative soul.

The fiery aura of those live sessions was captured in Danielle’s book, along with inflamed inspiration and actionable insight. If you are feeling unclear about your conscious calling, allow Danielle to kick you in the tush – lovingly, of course. This maven will challenge you to _up_ your game and bump your career and lifestyle vision up a notch _or three._

If you’re ready for a blast of clarity, a surge of heat, and finally, a reevaluation of what success means to you – light your torch and read on, my friend. **You’re a Fire Starter now.**

Nowadays, I find myself trying to embrace my eccentricities, focus on ease, and allow myself to be a complete failure in things like cooking. _Luckily, my husband makes a killer risotto._

Keep your fire ablaze, fellow Fire Starter. Spread the spark.

What would your life be like if you did only what was easy?
