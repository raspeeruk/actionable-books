  ### Rapid Skill Acquisition is Unrelated to Academic Learning


  > "Those tests, however, had nothing to do with my ability to exercise the
  skills."- The First 20 Hours, page 7


  Schooling is about scoring well on the test. Every one of us took classes in
  school during which we aced the tests (or did well enough) but about which we
  have nearly zero recall.


  The purpose of rapid skill acquisition is to **permanently add that beneficial
  skill** to our abilities. **Focused practice** based on the high points and
  central aspects of a new skill has value. Memorization of minutiae does not.


  Rapid skill acquisition is a form of immersion. It requires some setup to
  prevent us from sabotaging ourselves.

  ### Be Willing to Jump in Over Your Head


  > "Provided you're working on a lovable problem or project, the more confused
  you are at the outset, the more internal pressure you'll feel to figure things
  out, and the faster you'll learn."- The First 20 Hours, page 30


  It should be obvious that **learning a new skill requires doing things we’ve
  never done before.**


  Should be.


  We humans are a funny lot. We all want that new skill, right? Yet the
  confusion and frustration we have to cross to get there stops most of us from
  getting beyond, well, **confusion and frustration**.


  It’s the primary reason **Kaufman recommends choosing what he calls “a lovable
  project”** to dive into. Learning in order to pass a test, to impress the
  boss, to take on yet another tedious task – who would choose to go through
  frustration and confusion to reach that goal?


  But imagine playing simple songs on the piano. Or typing 40 words per minute
  instead of 15. Managing your own website. Building your own book case.
  Surfing. Speaking in public or speaking a new language.


  It’s not the skill, it’s **what the skill will add to your life**. Visualize
  being good enough at whatever it is you’ve been wishing you could do. If that
  image makes the little hairs at the back of your neck tingle, it’s worth
  pushing through some frustration and confusion.


  This method of rapid skill acquisition is specifically **designed to make the
  painful part of learning as brief as possible**; to quickly achieve something
  fun enough that the rest of the focused practice feels like learning instead
  of work.


  There’s a skill you wish you had. You’ve toyed with the idea but it’s never
  gone anywhere.


  Time to be done with toying. Most of us can fit this method into 6 weeks or
  less.


  **Tell me, down in the comments, what you’d like to learn in the first 20
  hours.**


  (And for extra points, how will the concepts of preventing distractions and
  willingness to jump in over your head grow your psyche in ways you can apply
  elsewhere in your life?)

  ### Distractions Are the Primary Enemy


  > "Distractions kill focused practice, and lack of focused practice leads to
  slow (or nonexistent) skill acquisition."- The First 20 Hours, page 33


  When Kaufman experimented with “coasting” after he’d learned the basics of
  touch typing, he discovered that a month of using his new skill every single
  day had precisely zero effect on his speed or accuracy. It was only **focused
  intentional practice** which added value. The primary enemy of focused
  practice is distraction.


  The primary distractions in your life are electronic and human. You know right
  now what and who they are.


  **Preparing not to be distracted** is vital to focused practice. Shut off the
  devices. Arrange practice time so the human distractions in your life will
  have the least impact. (As a father of 7 who works from home I know this is
  easier said than done. I also know it can be done.)


  Making time and space for practice is **primarily emotional**. Separating from
  your everyday life for a little while feels awkward, strange. It’s part of the
  process. It’s also part of the price you have to be willing to pay for rapid
  skill acquisition.

  "By knowing what you're getting into, learning the fundamentals, practicing
  intelligently, and developing a practice routine, you'll make progress more
  quickly and consistently, and you'll achieve expert status in record time."
