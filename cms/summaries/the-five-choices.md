  ### Pause, Clarify, Decide


  > "The key to getting into Q2 \[the Important not Urgent productivity
  quadrant\] is to pause your reactive brain long enough to clarify what is
  coming at you, then decide whether it is worth your time and energy."- The
  Five Choices, page 49


  Pause. Clarify. Decide. It sounds so simple and yet in our overscheduled,
  fast-paced lives we often simply put our heads down and plow through the items
  on our daily to do lists without really thinking about why we are doing what
  we are doing. Then we bemoan the fact that we are always running from crisis
  to crisis putting out fires while failing to set aside time to take the
  preventative actions that would reduce the number of fires we are fighting!


  And technology has upped the urgency factor. Computers and mobile devices
  buzz, beep, flash and vibrate constantly and like Pavlov’s dogs we have been
  conditioned to respond to those triggers the moment they activate. We tell
  ourselves we are being responsive and efficient, while in reality we are
  carelessly syphoning valuable time and energy into lower value distractions.
  Be honest. How many emails, calls or interruptions do you receive that
  absolutely must be addressed immediately or the world as you know it will go
  up in flames?


  Taking time to ‘pause, clarify and decide’ helps you determine where your time
  and energy is best directed in that moment. This winning strategy only works
  however, if you’ve taken the time to identify what is truly important to you.

  ### Win Without Fighting


  > "Win Without Fighting is based on the principle of automation. The goal is
  to confidently automate as many decisions as possible so our brain does not
  have to use up energy on the mundane, useless or unnecessary."- The Five
  Choices, page 133


  This actionable insight is associated with the fourth choice for extraordinary
  productivity: rule your technology, don’t let it rule you. The authors devote
  a whole chapter to this topic and provide a number of helpful,
  easy-to-implement suggestions for making technology work for you. The two
  strategies that I’ll be adopting to better manage the gravel disguised as
  emails are setting up rules/filters and adopting a Core 4 system for
  processing information.


  The authors have convinced me that taking the time to set up rules to sort my
  incoming emails into predetermined folders of my choosing will save me
  innumerable hours in the future and ensure only the most important messages
  are visible in my inbox. I can then review the auto-filed messages during my
  daily ‘weed and feed’ timeslot or another convenient time and won’t miss
  anything. Awesome!


  The Core 4 approach encourages you to manage incoming information as an
  appointment, a task, a contact, or notes/documents or a combination of those
  things. Read emails with a view to turning them into one or more of these four
  things, and then delete the email. The same applies to paperwork and verbal
  requests. Of course if it is unwanted junk mail well, you know what to do with
  that!


  Both strategies make sense when you realize that _“every email is a decision.
  And when we are busy deleting, moving, being tempted by, or answering emails,
  we are using up energy_ \[and time\] _that would be better applied
  elsewhere.”_

  ### Schedule the Big Rocks, Don’t Sort Gravel!


  > "The key shift in thinking for Choice #3 \[schedule the big rocks\] is to
  realize you can never get ahead by just sorting through the gravel faster."-
  The Five Choices, page 95


  Anyone who is familiar with Stephen R. Covey’s [_The 7 Habits of Highly
  Effective
  People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/)
  knows that the Big Rocks analogy refers to your top priorities; time devoted
  to key relationships and responsibilities, important projects, critical
  meetings, and so on. I have always liked this principle, however confess my
  execution over the years has been haphazard. With electronic calendars and
  lists, it is oh so easy to slide things around and let ‘other stuff’ hijack
  your time.


  That’s why I love the follow-up directive that accompanies Choice #3 – _don’t
  sort gravel!_ Gravel represents the small stuff in our lives – things like
  email, household chores, routine meetings, TV, social media and so on. These
  things can consume a lot of time with minimal return on your investment.


  I definitely don’t want to be someone who ‘sorts gravel’ so I’ve decided to
  experiment with visualization and add some virtual weight to my big rocks. I
  now think of my calendar as a garden where I am growing the things that are
  important to me. Each week (and day) I remind myself what I want in my garden
  and identify the tasks I need to do that will help those dreams blossom. Those
  tasks get prime time in my calendar. I think of those tasks as focal points
  for my garden; large, heavy rocks that should not (and cannot) be moved on a
  whim (after all, they weigh a ton!) As a result I find I am more motivated to
  follow-through with those tasks and less inclined to shift them around without
  a really, really good reason. I also am trying to block time for daily ‘weed
  and feed’ activities where I group routine and unanticipated tasks together
  rather than addressing them as soon as they are noticed.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Five Choices_ was a quick and inspiring read. Even though the core
  principles and choices were not new to me, I gained a deeper awareness of how
  different choices positively (or negatively) influence my productivity levels
  and overall sense of accomplishment. I also picked up some easy action items
  that will help me spend more of my time on my Q2 activities (important, not
  urgent).

  done, but to get the right things done – the important things – with the
  highest quality you can achieve."

> "In today’s environment, the key to productivity is not to get more things done, but to get the right things done – the important things – with the highest quality you can achieve." _\- The Five Choices, page 11_

Well, I see you are interested in increasing your productivity. An admirable goal and one I share. But before we go any further, please go back and re-read that opening quote. Now isolate the key phrases in that statement. What did you select? I chose ‘key to productivity’, ‘right things done’, and ‘highest quality’. Which converts nicely into a simple formula for success: Productivity = doing the right things + highest quality.

That’s an interesting ah-ha moment. Typically when most people think about productivity they want to get _more_ _things done_ in _less time_. I’m not sure that is a sustainable or effective lifestyle choice and the sooner you let go of that illusion the better.

_The Five Choices: The Path to Extraordinary Productivity_ is a FranklinCovey publication, firmly grounded in Dr. Stephen Covey’s time management quadrants and principles. Kory Kogon and Adam Merrill repackage these timeless principles into five choices that help address three key issues faced by people regardless of context – decision management, attention management and energy management. The book utilizes several examples to illustrate the concepts and tackles the challenges associated with information overload in our 24/7 technology dependent world.

What strategies do you use to stay focused on the important but not necessarily urgent things in your life? Which of the strategies I mentioned can you see yourself adopting (pause, clarify, decide; schedule big rocks-don’t sort gravel or win without fighting)?
