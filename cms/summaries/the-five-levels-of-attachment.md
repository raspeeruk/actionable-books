  ### The Soccer Analogy of Attachment


  > "Everything is made of light. We are the stars and the stars are us. When we
  see this, all of our senses are truly open and there is no need to interpret
  the world. In this moment, our full, unlimited potential is available to us.
  There is nothing blocking our way."- The Four Agreements, page xiii


  What happens is, instead of taking a given life experience for what it is, we
  create a story to make it fit our beliefs. Let’s look at how this process
  works via soccer team/game analogies that can be readily applied to any
  situation.


  1\. **The Authentic Self:** You enjoy watching the game for what it is. The
  moment the referee blows the ending whistle – win or lose – you go on with
  your life.


  2\. **Preference:** You now root for one team. You’ve invested an emotional
  side of yourself that enjoys the ups and downs of a great game, but are yet
  able to let go.


  3\. **Identity:** You’re a committed fan of one team. While you’re able to
  enjoy a beer with an opposing fan, your attachment extends beyond stadium
  gates.


  4\. **Internalization:** Your association with your favorite team is intrinsic
  to your identity. Your team’s performance affects self-worth. Whether others
  agree or disagree with you is a condition for acceptance versus rejection.


  5\. **Fanaticism:** You worship your team. An opposing fan is an enemy. In
  your eyes, a true fan is willing to die and kill for his or her soccer heroes.


  By extension, don Miguel Ruiz Jr. points out it’s not much of a stretch to
  imagine the effects of believing any extreme idea in the realms of religion,
  politics, money, power or otherwise upon our collective consciousness (which
  he calls The Dream of The Planet).

  ### Discovering the Foundation of Your Beliefs


  > "I am only responsible for what I say; I am not responsible for what you
  hear."- The Five Levels of Attachment, page 19


  Here’s an intriguing one: Tap into your memory and recall those experiences by
  which you made assumptions that were later shown to be untrue. Identify the
  missing pieces of information. Think about why you chose to fill in the gaps
  how you did at the time.


  Back to the fictitious dating example, you assumed they were cheating.
  Unchecked, the wound of imagined betrayal would negatively impact not only
  your emotional sense of self but also reinforce faulty relationship beliefs.


  **Uncomfortable emotions are like car alarms: they let us know there’s a
  problem to attend to, thus allowing us to see our own truth.** Whenever an
  emotion gets triggered, it’s an opportune moment to ask questions such as:
  What is this about? What agreement is at the heart of this? What attachment
  does this threaten? Do I really believe this? Is it important?


  How freeing it is to know that our attachment to beliefs personal and
  collective can be cast off, like the mask they were in the first place. With
  awareness comes our ability to choose – to say yes or no all over again.


  In this way, we experience the liberation of returning to our Authentic
  Selves, unhindered by judgment and open to pursue our true life’s calling.

  ### Uncovering Your Assumptions


  > "By letting go of your attachment to what you think the melody should be,
  you open yourself to the potential to create a unique and beautiful song of
  your own composition or a collaboration that can be shared with others."- The
  Five Levels of Attachment, page xviii


  In this exercise, we’re invited to pretend we’re broken-hearted over our last
  relationship; our partner left us. Dating someone new for a few months, we’re
  waiting for their call and wondering why it’s not happening. Three possible
  explanations arise:


  *   They’re out with friends.

  *   They’re at the gym working out.

  *   They’re cheating on us.


  If we’re unaware of our assumptions, we’ll gravitate to the “narrative” that
  reinforces our assumptions as the mind’s attachments grow. At that moment, the
  door opens and in walks the paramour with bags full of food and goodies.
  “Surprise!” they say. Yet, we turn around in anger and pick a fight.


  The antidote is to see our attachments for what they are. **They’re merely one
  possibility.** When presented a different truth, we can detach because the old
  belief no longer serves us.

> "Is knowledge controlling you, or are you controlling knowledge?" _\- The Five Levels of Attachment, page 67_

Building on the principles found in his father’s best-selling book (The Four Agreements) don Miguel Ruiz Jr. invites us to gauge how attached we are to our own viewpoint. In _The Five Levels of Attachment_, we gain awareness of agreements implicitly made across the years – agreements which shape our reality and affect our future. We are further shown how to release those which no longer reflect who we really are.

For the purposes of a common definition, this Toltec writer defines an “agreement” as the thoughts and beliefs we have said yes to.
