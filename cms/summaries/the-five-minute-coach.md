  ### Ensure a commitment for change originates within the individual


  > "Moving someone’s thinking from a problem to an outcome – from something
  unwanted to something wanted – is very potent."- The Five-Minute Coach, page
  38


  Cooper and Castellino offer ten important five-minute coach behaviours to help
  underpin a session. They are:


  1.  Pay close attention

  2.  Use only the Five-Minute Coach questions

  3.  Avoid the normal rules of conversation

  4.  Repeat the coachee’s words

  5.  Disregard grammatical rules

  6.  Take notes

  7.  Limit eye contact

  8.  Encourage the coachee

  9.  Use voice to influence

  10.  Stay cool, calm and collected


  Sitting with these ten behaviours requires an ability to adapt to discomfort,
  or learn a new way of being in certain situations. This approach means taking
  the self out of the equation to become a conduit, which creates a new skill
  for the coach.


  How can you use the five-minute coach behaviours to improve performance? Keep

  ### Developing as a Coach


  > "Coaching helps people learn from the inside out, not the other way
  around."- The Five-Minute Coach, page 195


  The principles of good coaching is what _The Five-Minute Coach_ is all about.
  Keeping clear boundaries, from another person, is not even an issue when
  adopting this approach. Here are the outcomes you can expect:


  *   Coaching helps people learn from the inside out, not the other way around.
  It assumes that people have innate capabilities and therefore do not need to
  be constantly told _what_ to do.

  *   Focusing on outcomes – what could be, rather than what is – is fundamental
  to the unleashing of people’s potential and upgrading their performance.

  *   Coaching encourages individuals, through support and increased
  self-awareness, to take personal responsibility for creating their own
  opportunities, making their own choices and deciding on their own actions.

  *   An individual’s self-belief grows through the coaching process, and new
  thinking, feelings and behaviours emerge as a result.


  There is a feeling of relief when you realize you do not have to take on other
  people’s problems – and that you are not really being helpful when you try.
  And, there is a sense of fulfillment in knowing that simply by asking
  questions you are enabling another person to grow. I now keep _The Five-Minute
  Coach_ in sight so I can quickly refer to the questions, and examples, to help
  me help others. Questions are a powerful tool and when used to empower others
  they become even more potent.


  In the comments below, let us know… And what would you like to have happen?

  ### And what would you like to have happen?


  > "Direct attention to the interviewee’s own words and deepen and develop her
  thinking."- The Five-Minute Coach, page 7


  The first question, “And what would you like to have happen?”, is a powerful
  tool that the authors suggest the reader practice several times a day, in all
  kinds of situations. I love this question and have been adding it to
  conversations regularly. I also ask myself this question to move forward in my
  own life – personal and professional. By thinking through what you want to
  have happen you create action steps that move you towards your goals.


  The authors offer five stages and a purpose and questions for each stage to
  take one through the five minute conversation.


  1.  **Identifying an outcome** – And what would you like to have happen?

  2.  **Choosing the best outcome** – And when \[outcome in coachee’s words\],
  _then_ what happens?

  3.  **Discovering more about the outcome** – And when \[new outcome\] what
  kind of \[word or phrase from outcome\]?

  4.  **Action planning** – And what needs to happen for \[final outcome\]?

  5.  **Motivate to act** – And when \[first thing\] _then_ what happens?


  There is lots of repeating of the questions, and more word changes to the
  questions are shown in the actual book. I found the exercise of looking
  through all the questions, and case study examples to be quite helpful. This
  process is definitely an approach that coaches – or anyone – will want to add
  to their repertoire.


  As the questions progress, the coach incorporates the coachee’s words into
  part of each sentence, like this:


  **And when** \[last answer\], **_then_ what happens?**


  The bold part of the question stays the same while the parts in the square
  brackets are the coachee’s words. The word “and” lets the other person know
  you hear and accept what has been said.

> "Establish a shift from problem-thinking to an outcome focus." _\- The Five-Minute Coach, page 6_

Coaches Lynne Cooper and Mariette Castellino present _The Five-Minute Coach_ as a helpful step-by-step coaching guide to achieve amazing results fast. The book is meant to help busy managers, and internal coaches, improve job performance and fulfillment through a simple but effective approach. The idea is that, by asking specific questions, managers stop fixing problems themselves and empower their team to take charge of their own issues. While asking questions is not a new tool, I found the straightforward approach offered in this book to be profound. The questions, asked by the interviewer, draw attention to the interviewee’s own words to expand thinking and let the individual establish a shift from problem-thinking to an outcome focus.

The concept is based on the work of David Grove – the originator of Clean Language – and his idea that change must come from within each person. Integral to success is the foundation piece that it can be “preferable to first step backwards, sideways, upwards, or downwards in order to see things from a different perspective and move forward from a difference place.” Breaking through straight-line thinking is the goal and this is inside work done from within each person’s mind and body. It can seem appealing to instead, as a coach, rescue or solve your coachee’s problems. This is where the depth of the Five-Minute Coach is revealed, through its apparent simplicity. Ask specific questions. Stay neutral. Let the individual solve the dilemma.

_The Five-Minute Coach_ is presented in a clean white designed cover to underline its intent: Clean Language. A hint of red implies there is action underneath. The book is well put together and easy to flip through with lots of clear headings and sections. Helpful charts and exercises take the reader through sample conversations using a series of questions meant to empower people to make a step change in the way they work. I like the idea of asking questions in any situation – work or personal life. When it comes to creating change the answers are already inside a person waiting to be released.

So, how do you become an effective Five-Minute Coach?
