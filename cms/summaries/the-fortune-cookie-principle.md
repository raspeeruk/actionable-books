  ### Be a brand, not a commodity


  > "Branding might enable you to be top-of-mind. But top of-mind isn’t the same
  as close-to-heart."- Fortune Cookie Principle, page 12


  Just because people know who you are does not mean that they care. And the
  only way to make them care and feel something is to attach meaning to your
  product to make it a brand.


  **Product – Meaning = Commodity**


  **Product + Meaning = Brand**


  People do not buy your product because of its features, even if they use it as
  justification. They buy because of how it makes them feel.


  The same way we do not buy fortune cookies because they taste better than
  other cookies, but because of the delight they deliver at the end of a meal.

  ### The 20 key brand building framework


  > "The Fortune Cookie Principle is a brand building framework and
  communication strategy consisting of twenty keys that enable you to begin
  telling your brand’s story from the inside out."- Fortune Cookie Principle,
  page 14


  Bernadette gives you 20 keys to help you begin telling your brand’s story:


  **1.** **The Truth** – What business are you really in? How do your customers
  want to feel? You are not selling cars, you are selling safety (Volvo) or
  excitement (Porsche).


  **2\. Purpose** – What is the reason you exist? (Hint: it’s not to make
  money.) Google satisfies curiosity for anyone with access the the web. Share
  your purpose and give your brand a reason to matter.


  **3\. Vision** – What happens because you exist? How will the change your
  business brings about change how your customers feel and act?


  **4\. Values** – How are you demonstrating your beliefs to the world and to
  your customers? Not knowing the beliefs of the company leaves you incapable of
  acting in the correct way.


  **5\. Products and Services** – Most products and services can and should have
  meaning attached to them.


  **6\. Your People** – Whom you hire, what they stand for, and how they show up
  all tell a story.


  **7\. Value you deliver** – Value has very little to do with price. Yet, we
  keep wondering what people will pay for instead of wondering what is valuable.


  **8\. Name and Tagline** – A great name can elevate a business and build a
  story around it. Nike would not have been so successful if they stuck with
  their old name: Blue Ribbon Sports.


  **9\. Content and Copy** – Your content and copy are your voice and the way
  you communicate your brand’s personality. If it is not interesting and
  engaging then you will fail to communicate effectively.


  **10\. Design** – Design can change how people feel and interact with your
  brand. Think Apple.


  **11.Your Actions** – Your actions are everything you do. From answering the
  phone through to support. They must be aligned with your company values.


  **12\. Customer Experience** – Customer experience is everything that happens
  when people encounter your brand.


  **13\. Price and Quality** – The price you charge sends a signal to the type
  of people you want to attract.


  **14\. Perception** – Influencing how your customers perceive your brand is
  about changing how they feel in every interaction, not by how you manipulate
  their thinking.


  **15\. Distribution** – How you get your products and services into the hands
  of customers sends them a signal about your brand. It can also provide a
  competitive advantage.


  **16\. Location** – Location isn’t just about where you choose to do business;
  it’s about figuring out where your customers are.


  **17\. Ubiquity or Scarcity** – Do you want to appeal to the masses or create
  products and services for people with a particular worldview?


  **18\. Community** – Does the brand have a purpose that brings your customers
  together as a community? Could it?


  **19\. Reputation** – What does one person say to another to recommend your
  brand? People trust stories and reference from other people more than your own
  website.


  **20\. Reaction and Reach** – Are you giving customers opportunities to
  demonstrate loyalty to your brand?

  ### Tell a better brand story


  > "Every day, people who are ‘good enough’ succeed because they tell a better
  story."- Fortune Cookie Principle, page 8


  A brand story is more than just the written narrative. The story is a complete
  picture made up of facts, feelings, and interpretations, which means that part
  of your story isn’t even told by you.


  Your audience choose the message they want to hear, and they now have the
  (social media) platforms and tools to spread the ideas they care about. So,
  give them a great story to tell.


  It’s not the product with the most features and bells and whistles that comes
  out on top. Nor is it the top performers that get the best jobs.


  Dollar Shave Club took the ultimate commodity and told a story about how you
  are paying too much for shave tech you do not need, which matched the
  worldview of their potential customers. Their $4500 promo video went viral
  resulting in 17,000 new subscribers. In contrast Gillette spent $185m on
  marketing in 2010.


  It’s those who tell a better story that win.

  Some of these keys will be more important than others depending on your
  industry and unique circumstances. Which ones are important in your business?
  What have you done to tell your story and turn your product from a commodity
  into a brand?
f_quote-2: >-
  "Every idea, every innovation, every product and service has two elements: the
  cookie and the fortune. The cookie is the commodity, the utility, the tangible
  product. The cookie is the thing you put in the shop window and it has a fixed
  value. Then there’s the fortune, the magical, intangible part of the product
  or service, which is where the real value lies in the heart and minds of the
  customer."

We live in an age where it is easy to reach people, but hard to make them listen or care. There is too much noise and infinite choice. So, most brands’ messages get ignored.

The only way to get noticed and remembered, according to Bernadette Jiwa in her book, _The Fortune Cookie Principle_, is to change how people feel about your brand. Giving them a reason why you should matter to them.

To achieve this, marketers must stop selling the features (cookie) and rather spend their time on creating a better story (fortune).

And a better story is not done through advertising or a marketing campaign slapped on at the end of product creation. It is baked into everything your brand does and touch, right from the start.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Be a brand, not a commodity

> "Branding might enable you to be top-of-mind. But top of-mind isn’t the same as close-to-heart."- Fortune Cookie Principle, page 12

Just because people know who you are does not mean that they care. And the only way to make them care and feel something is to attach meaning to your product to make it a brand.

**Product – Meaning = Commodity**

**Product + Meaning = Brand**

People do not buy your product because of its features, even if they use it as justification. They buy because of how it makes them feel.

The same way we do not buy fortune cookies because they taste better than other cookies, but because of the delight they deliver at the end of a meal.
