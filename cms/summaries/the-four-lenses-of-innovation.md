  ### You’ve got it In You!


  > "Once we accept that creativity is not a birthright of exceptional people
  but a skill that can be taught and acquired, we can begin to seriously tap
  into the latent innovation potential inside all of us and across our
  organizations."- The 4 Lenses of Innovation, page 258


  Have you noticed how many people are quick to write themselves off when it
  comes to possessing certain traits or talents – like creativity, leadership
  and bravery? We’ve all heard someone remark, “I don’t have a creative bone in
  my body”, “I’m not leadership material”, or “I wish I was brave like…” (and,
  be honest, we’ve said these things ourselves from time to time).


  The fact is, we are capable of doing a lot more than we give ourselves credit
  for. It’s simply a lot easier to opt out than it is to opt in and devote the
  time and energy required to develop the trait or talent in question. Like
  anything in life, if we truly want something, we will find a way to get it.
  So, if _you_ want to be more creative and innovative, if you want _your
  employees_ to be more creative and innovative, then you have to _deliberately
  focus on learning and practicing how to become more creative and innovative_.
  And a great way to do that is to apply Gibson’s four lenses to a challenge or
  problem you are currently facing.

  ### Sow and You will Reap


  > "You can’t produce big, breakthrough ideas unless you first generate the
  right kinds of insights."- The 4 Lenses of Innovation, page 250


  Gibson describes an insight as _“something you previously didn’t know, or
  didn’t yet think about, that has the power to surprise and inspire you.”_ We
  might call them ‘ahhh moments’; times when we suddenly _see_ or experience
  something that suggests a solution to a problem we are struggling with.
  Insights are the directional arrows that point the way to new ideas.


  Unfortunately, our innovation processes too often rely on poorly managed
  brainstorming sessions. We review data the way we’ve always reviewed data
  (recall the peril of patterns). We settle for incremental improvements and
  familiar solutions instead of big bold changes. Gibson promises we will
  generate more meaningful insights and ideas if our data and brainstorming is
  fueled by his four lenses of innovation.


  Give people permission to challenge the status quo. Explore the implications
  of emergent trends and combine your resources and assets in different ways.
  Approach unfulfilled customer needs from different angles. Try asking
  different questions and bring different people into your brainstorming and
  problem solving sessions. Use flip chart paper, crayons and yes, Lego blocks,
  to stimulate playful experimentation. If you want a different result, you have
  to do business differently!

  ### Patterns – See Them! Break Them!


  > "What the innovators are actually seeing is patterns. They recognize some
  existing configuration of things that doesn’t make sense to them (so they want
  to question or alter it), or an emerging cluster of trends that has the power
  to change the game, or a potential recombination of elements that could create
  significant new value, or a repeated pattern of behaviour that reveals a deep
  customer need."- The 4 Lenses of Innovation, page 65


  Patterns can be our best friends and our worst enemies! Due to the massive
  amount of inputs and stimuli that surround us, our brain is hard-wired to
  create and respond to patterns. We learn how to recognize danger, convert
  letter combinations into words and sentences, and interpret road signs. Games
  like tic tac toe, checkers and chess are won or lost based on our ability to
  see and react to patterns. It’s how we conserve our mental energy for more
  complex situations.


  However, the downside to creating and using patterns is that we eventually
  stop paying attention to them. We do things ‘on auto-pilot’ without thinking,
  never questioning if that is the best way to do something. This behaviour even
  has a name – _functional fixedness – “a kind of mental block that limits us to
  understanding and using the things around us only in the traditional ways we
  have learned.”_


  Ideas are nothing more than a pattern of thoughts arranged in a particular
  way. New ideas form when people generate different patterns or combinations of
  thoughts that suggest a more exciting or better course of action. Successful
  innovators are willing to disrupt the patterns that the rest of us have become
  complacent about.


  So, here’s where you can have a little fun. Look for patterns in the things
  you do daily and see if you can break them apart like Lego blocks then put
  them back together in a different way. Change up the route you drive to work,
  use different ingredients in your salads or sandwiches, rearrange the
  furniture in your living room or den! Once you’ve shaken up these ‘safe’
  routines, you can look for opportunities to experiment with bigger operational
  issues and challenges.
f_conclusion: >-
  Gibson has written a highly engaging book that outlines a systematic, proven
  method for developing and sustaining a more innovative culture within teams,
  organizations and communities. He explains the theories that underpin the four
  lenses of innovation and shares real-life examples of those principles in
  action. His methodology isn’t rocket science – it’s immensely do-able. All it
  takes is a commitment to using the four lenses to see challenges and
  opportunities differently.

  "How do innovators manage to spot the opportunities for industry revolution
  that everyone else seems to miss? What is it that enables them to imagine
  radically new or different ways of doing things that will fundamentally change
  customer expectations and behaviours, or break long established industry
  paradigms, or shift the entire basis for competitive advantage?"

> "How do innovators manage to spot the opportunities for industry revolution that everyone else seems to miss? What is it that enables them to imagine radically new or different ways of doing things that will fundamentally change customer expectations and behaviours, or break long established industry paradigms, or shift the entire basis for competitive advantage?" _\- The 4 Lenses of Innovation, page xiii_

If you are looking for the answers to those questions and more, then you’ll want to devour Rowan Gibson’s book, _The 4 Lenses of Innovation: A Power Tool for Creative Thinking_, from cover to cover! Beautifully illustrated with visuals, stories and examples, Gibson explores the Renaissance past for clues to creativity and innovation. He converts what he finds into four lenses that can be used to unleash the innovation capability buried deep within us:

1.  **Challenging Orthodoxies** – the willingness to question long-held beliefs and assumptions about the way things are by asking why? and, why not?
2.  **Harnessing Trends** – noticing emerging developments across different sectors and disciplines and thinking about how they might alter your present course of action;
3.  **Leveraging Resources** – redeploying or recombining skills, assets, ideas or materials in new and different ways (think Lego blocks!) to create novel solutions; and,
4.  **Understanding Needs** – keying in on the frustrations and challenges facing customers that competitors ignore (often referred to as ‘pain points’ in business).

Gibson concludes by describing how big ideas are built and shares a replicable system for deliberately cultivating innovative ideas from inputs through to outputs and the infamous “Eureka” moment.

You don’t have to land a job at Google, Amazon, Zappos, or Facebook to unleash the innovator that resides within you. You do have to turn off your auto-pilot and turn on your childlike curiosity about the world around you. Are you ready to start your own innovation renaissance?

Which of the four lenses would you be most comfortable trying first? Where might you use that lens to generate some new insights?
