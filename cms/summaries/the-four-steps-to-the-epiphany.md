  ### Customer Development and Product Development are parallel processes


  > "For a startup to succeed, Product and Customer Development must remain
  synchronized and operate in concert"- The Four Steps to the Epiphany, page 36


  In the initial step of Customer Discovery, Product Development builds
  according to the founder’s vision to test whether the business model is
  correct, and whether the product solves customer problems and needs.


  During Customer Validation, a sales roadmap that can be replicated is
  developed. The product development team builds the product incrementally and
  iteratively – getting it out of the door and quickly revising it in response
  to the feedback of early adopters.


  The steps of Customer Creation and Business Building serve to create and drive
  end user demand and to transition an organization designed for learning and
  discovery into formal, functional departments geared for efficient execution.
  Product development needs to keep up with increased demands, and also be
  involved with installation and customer support.


  In 1994, when Steve Powell of FastOffice created an all in one office device,
  he focused on selling to home offices only to find that people were not
  willing to pay $1400 for a ‘nice to have’ device. Eventually FastOffice
  discovered that their core asset was in the data communications technology so
  it discarded its products for the home and became a major supplier of
  equipment to telecommunications carriers. The Customer Discovery process would
  have revealed the need to switch to a different market much earlier.

  ### Would you deploy the product if it was free?


  > "The goal is to take pricing away as an issue and see if the product itself
  gets customers excited"- The Four Steps to the Epiphany, page 69


  Asking this question reveals the extent to which customers find the product
  valuable.


  If the customer is willing to use the product if it were free, continue by
  asking, “Actually I cannot give it away for free. I will need to charge $1
  million for it. Would you buy it?” The customer might reply, “There is no way
  I will pay more than $250 000 for it.” You have just discovered how much they
  think the product is worth to them.


  In the case of Chip Stevens in 2002, his product ‘Snapshot’ was a software
  that helped financial officers of major corporations manage profitability.
  Products were given free to beta customers and it turned out that they were
  not willing to deploy the product even if the price were zero, because it did
  not solve a problem that was mission critical enough to justify the
  disruption.


  This leads to the observation that products should be sold, and not given
  free, to beta customers so that a realistic, replicable sales roadmap can be
  developed.

  ### What type of startup are you?


  > "Thinking and acting as if all startups are the same is a strategic error…
  Market type changes everything a company does."- The Four Steps to the
  Epiphany, page 31


  There are four different types of startups, defined by market type:


  *   Startups **entering an existing market**. For example, a new brand of
  pizza

  *   Startups **creating an entirely new market**. For example, a pizza
  flavoured meal replacement.

  *   Startups that **want to re-segment an existing market as a low-cost
  entrant**. For example, discounts for bulk buys.

  *   Startups that **want to re-segment an existing market as a niche player**.
  For example, organic pizzas.


  Launching a product into an existing market has the advantage of existing
  customers but faces greater competition. A product in a new market has no
  competitors, but there are no well-defined and known customers either. Growth
  in an existing market could be a linear upward path, while in new markets it
  will take a few years before steady growth kicks in, when the product becomes
  mainstream.


  Therefore, customer education is the focus in new markets, while branding and
  positioning will be important in existing markets.


  When PhotosToYou pioneered the idea of quality prints for digital cameras in
  the late 1990s, it focused on a large and expensive branding program without
  much impact. PhotosToYou was entering a new market which typically takes 3 to
  5 years to develop. Consumer choice was not permanent and spending money early
  to grab market share was not an effective strategy. Instead, it should have
  focused on market adoption, for example, by educating the early adopters so
  that they can spread the word about the new online photofinishing market.

  _The Four Steps to the Epiphany_ was written over ten years ago. By now, Steve
  Blank’s idea that startups are not smaller versions of large organisations,
  and they need to search for and establish their own scalable business models,
  have become mainstream concepts. The core ideas are being taught in
  universities, entrepreneurship programs and large corporations and have become
  the standard for commercialising scientific research in the US.

  "In the early stages of a startup, focusing on ‘execution’ will put you out of
  business. Instead, you need a ‘learning and discovery’ process so you can get
  the company to the point where you know what to execute."

> "In the early stages of a startup, focusing on ‘execution’ will put you out of business. Instead, you need a ‘learning and discovery’ process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute." _\- The Four Steps to the Epiphany, page 20_

The traditional Product Development Model where a concept is developed, tested and launched in sequence does not work for most startups because it fails to address two fundamental questions:

*   “What type of market are we launching the product into?” and
*   “Where are the customers?”

In _The Four Steps to the Epiphany_, Steve Blank explains that the Product Development Model works best in an established, well defined market where the basis of competition is understood and the customers are known.

Most startups do not fit into these criteria. They start with the founder’s vision which needs to be validated against customer demand and production capabilities. Aggressive branding and aiming for “first mover advantage” without an understanding of market acceptance is like climbing up a ladder that was leaning against the wrong building; and could only accelerate the cash burn rate and undermine investor confidence.

The Customer Development Model aims to avoid these pitfalls and improve the success rate of a startup.

There are four steps to the Customer Development Model: Customer Discovery, Customer Validation, Customer Creation and Company Building.

The core ideas are being taught in universities, entrepreneurship programs and large corporations and have become the standard for commercialising scientific research in the US.

The challenge to startups is not the lack of a proven methodology, but the determination and discipline to follow through the rigorous procedure of Customer Discovery and Validation. The executive teams, the board and the investors all need to understand that the processes, tedious as they may be, cannot be skipped.

Once the company has transitioned itself from Customer Discovery and Validation to Customer Creation and Company Building, the company structure will shift to be mission-centric and process driven, and may require a different set of leaders.

Do you, as a startup entrepreneur, have the skills and discipline to bring your startup from discovery to operation?
