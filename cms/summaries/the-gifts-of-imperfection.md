  ### Live Wholeheartedly!


  > "Wholehearted living is about…cultivating the courage, compassion, and
  connection to wake up in the morning and think, ‘No matter what gets done and
  how much is left undone, I am enough’. It’s going to bed at night thinking,
  ‘Yes, I am imperfect and vulnerable and sometimes afraid, but that doesn’t
  change the truth that I am also brave and worthy of love and belonging.’"- The
  Gifts of Imperfection, page 1


  Building on this foundational definition, Brown goes on to say wholehearted
  living is not a one-time choice. It’s a process. In fact, she sees it as a
  lifelong journey from “What will people think?” to “I am enough”.


  The central answers to reflective questions posed throughout are Courage,
  Compassion, and Connection.


  While this potent triad could seem like a cluster of lofty (even impossible)
  ideals, they’re actually daily practices that, when exercised enough, become
  incredible gifts. Do you want to hear something fascinating?
  **Wholeheartedness is as much about embracing our tenderness as it is about
  developing knowledge or claiming power.**


  Perhaps you’re thinking, _“Oh great, the very qualities I wish to deny or
  squelch altogether!”_ Here’s the beauty of it. Because we’re imperfect, we get
  plenty of opportunities to use these amazing tools each day. The end results
  include belonging and worthiness – ultimate quests that characterize the human
  experience.

  ### Dig Deep


  > "Often people attempt to live their lives backwards: they try to have more
  things, or more money, in order to do more what they want so they will be
  happier. The way it actually works is the reverse. You must first be who you
  really are, then do what you really need to do, in order to have what you
  want."- Margaret Young


  Based on thousands of conversations with men and women living in amazingly
  wholehearted ways, Brown found these special individuals operate in core ways
  very distinct from most of us – _particularly_ when exhausted or overwhelmed.
  They DIG by getting:


  *   **D**eliberate in their thoughts and behaviors through prayer, meditation,
  or simply setting intentions;

  *   **I**nspired to make new and different choices;

  *   **G**oing. They take action.


  For example, the author asserts within the “Cultivating Play and Rest”
  Guidepost: _“_**_We are a nation of overstressed adults raising overscheduled
  children._**_”_ Great challenge! Instead of viewing exhaustion as a status
  symbol, we are roused to silence gremlin voices that whisper_, “One more hour
  of work! Push through. You can catch up on your sleep this weekend.”_


  Given Brené’s admitted previous standby of soldiering on, she now carves out
  weekly fun to take photographs and do art projects with her kids. In turn,
  we’re urged to say “no” – today. **Buck the system. Take something off your
  list and add a nap!**

  ### 10 Guideposts for Living


  > "When we spend a lifetime trying to distance ourselves from the parts of our
  lives that don’t fit with who we think we’re supposed to be, we stand outside
  of our story and hustle for our worthiness by constantly performing,
  perfecting, pleasing, and proving. Our sense of worthiness – that critically
  important piece that gives us access to love and belonging – lives inside of
  our story."- The Gifts of Imperfection, page 23


  Brown’s fundamental commitment is to clarify “gauzy” terms tossed around all
  the time but rarely explained. She firmly believes good definitions should be
  accessible and actionable. Isn’t that perfect for our purposes?


  For instance, many of us use the terms _fitting in_ and _belonging_
  interchangeably. They’re not the same at all. One interferes with the other**.
  Fitting in is about becoming who you need to be to gain acceptance.** Can you
  spell chameleon? **Belonging doesn’t require us to _change_ who we are; it
  requires us to _be_ who we are.**

  Personally, I became aware of _The Gifts of Imperfection_ through an
  absolutely amazing TEDx talk. If you have only 20 minutes to spare one day
  (even if you don’t, you need to find that time), watch her YouTube on
  vulnerability.

  "Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving
  up on love and belonging and joy – the experiences that make us the most
  vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we
  discover the infinite power of our light."

_“Once you see a pattern, you can’t un-see it.”_ How true! How intriguingly this preface sentence draws the reader into an illuminating and provocative book.

In _The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You’re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are_, Brené Brown, a leading expert on shame and authenticity, shares practical tools and strategies so we are enabled to embrace the power of **wholehearted living** – a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness. Combined with honest (and poignant) storytelling, reading this rich work feels like an uplifting conversation with a very wise friend.

How aptly this food-for-thought is stated: _“The universe is not short on wake-up calls. We’re just quick to hit the snooze button.”_ **Until we’re willing to have an honest conversation about what gets in the way of putting qualities like courage and compassion into daily practice, we will never _ever_ change.**

To risk living in anything less than a wholehearted way due to avoidance of squishy feelings is for me too high a price to pay. May it be so for you, too!
