  ### Give, Give, Give And Then Be Open To Receive...


  > "So the secret to success...to gaining it, to having it, is to give, give,
  give. The secret to getting is giving. And the secret to giving is making
  yourself open to receiving."- The Go-Giver, page 105


  “Give, give, give” is not all about giving money, giving things for free, or
  giving to charity. Although, those are ways to give, giving goes beyond that.
  Give value. Share your talents. Give incredible experiences. During his first
  meeting with Pindar, and learning that the secret to success is giving, Joe
  asked a question I’m sure many of us would ponder: “Wouldn’t an awful lot of
  people take advantage of you?” Pindar goes on to explain that “Most of us have
  grown up seeing the world as a place of limitation rather than as a place of
  inexhaustible treasures. A world of competition rather than one of
  co-creation”. If you expect limitations and for people to take advantage of
  you – that’s what you will get. We get what we focus on and expect. So instead
  of worrying about being taken advantage of and falling into the mindset of
  lack and scarcity, be open to giving and expecting abundance.

  ### Be Open To Receive


  > "Receiving is the natural result of giving"- The Go-Giver, page 102


  When we refuse a gift from someone, we are refusing their right to give.
  Receiving is a natural result of giving. There is nothing wrong with
  receiving. It is our intentions and focus that can get us off track. We must
  learn to be open to receiving in order to perpetuate giving. When you focus on
  giving, serving, and providing value, you will be compensated. Your
  compensation will be determined by the number of people you serve and how well
  you serve them–The Law of Compensation. So, let’s change our mindset about
  receiving and trust the process.

  ### Be Authentic


  > "People, remember this: no matter what your training, no matter what your
  skills, no matter what area you're in, you are your most important
  commodity."- The Go-Giver, page 87


  What do you have to give? How do you give when you are just starting out? The
  greatest gift you can give is _you_ – authentically. The Law of Authenticity
  is the fourth law of the five. I am a big believer in being authentic. Yes, I
  believe it is important to learn the skills of your trade, however, what sets
  you apart from all the rest is your uniqueness. So be true to yourself and
  what you believe. Celebrate your perfect imperfections because those are the
  very things that will draw people to you. Also remember, people do business
  with _people_, not businesses.

  I always love to read books that will help me improve my business as well as
  my life. The principles outlined in _The Go-Giver_ can easily be applied to
  both.

> “All right. I'm going to share my Trade Secret with you now.” _\- The Go-Giver, page 11_

_The Go-Giver_ by Bob Burg and John Davide Mann is written in the form of a parable. It lays out a story of a man named Joe and how he learns the “Trade Secret” of a very successful businessman, consultant, and keynote speaker known as Pindar. Joe originally sets out to leverage Pindar’s clout to land a large account. He instead learns a valuable lesson about being a go-giver and The Five Laws of Stratospheric Success. Although the story is fictional, it reflects experiences the authors themselves have had or have witnessed. The Laws are drawn from various mentors, businesses, philosophies, etc. that Burg and Mann have observed over time. Here are The Five Laws of Stratospheric Success as outlined in the book:

*   **The Law of Value** – Your true worth is determined by how much more you give in value than you take in payment.
*   **The Law of Compensation** – Your income is determined by how many people you serve and how well you serve them.
*   **The Law of Influence** – Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people’s interests first.
*   **The Law of Authenticity** – The most valuable gift you have to offer is yourself.
*   **The Law of Receptivity** – The key to effective giving is to stay open to receiving.
