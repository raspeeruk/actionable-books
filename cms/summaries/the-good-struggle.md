  ### The Pursuit of the Good Struggle


  > "...intellectual honesty about this world and its full implication for an
  organization is the first, essential, inescapable step toward responsible,
  successful leadership."- The Good Struggle, page 53


  There is an age-old question about whether leaders are born or made. The
  answer is: Yes. Both. Anyone and everyone is capable of being a leader. But it
  takes commitment to become a good and responsible leader.


  Knowing who we are, what we stand for, what we will not tolerate, combined
  with the abilities to learn, unlearn, adapt, and keep moving forward all
  provide moral and directional compasses by which we lead our lives and our
  companies forward. We accomplish this with a large dose of intellectual
  honesty. Intellectual honesty is seeing things the way they truly are, rather
  than as the way we want them to be.


  Badarracco feels that the essence of what makes a good leader can be summed up
  by answering what he calls the “five enduring questions.” These are questions
  which each leader must be able to answer for ourselves.


  1\. Am I really grappling with the fundamentals?


  2\. What am I accountable for?


  3\. How do I make critical decisions?


  4\. Do we have the right core values?


  5\. Why have I chosen this life?

  ### Bright Lines Guide the Path


  > "...survival and success depend crucially on the tenacity, creativity and
  passion of leaders."- The Good Struggle, page 136


  Great leaders have always been concerned with values. And, we lead best by
  sticking to our core values, and using what Joseph Badaracco refers to in his
  book as Bright Lines.


  Most people and companies tend to state their values in convoluted mission or
  value statements. Most of the time these are just pretty words that sound like
  something we _should_ all stand for, but degenerate into a mantra which no one
  believes or believes in. These are the words we recite at the beginning of our
  meetings or make into plaques, but have no effect on the day to day behavior
  of people or organizations.


  Bright Lines are those values that leaders believe are so vitally important
  that when they are violated they lead to firing or strict probation. There is
  a Warren Buffet quote from the book that sums this up nicely. “If you lose
  money for the firm by bad decisions, I will be very understanding. If you lose
  reputation, I will be ruthless.”


  Bright Lines are those things we and our organizations stand for when things
  get hard, or when real sacrifice is required.


  Adherence to Bright Lines means that the values we work with are extensions of
  ourselves and our organizations. We believe in these things and they keep us
  on the path to accountability and credibility.


  Bright Lines are one of the three core commitments of responsible leadership.
  The other two are clarity and meaningful projects.


  Responsible leadership is supportive of people and meaningful projects.
  Badaracco uses the phrase “surgery without a knife.” These are the projects
  that people take on and are committed to because they want to make a clear,
  direct and immediate impact on their organizations.

  ### Responsible Leadership is a Choice


  > "Quis custodies ipsos custodies?"- The Good Struggle, page 55


  Badaracco tells us that good leaders choose their roles and responsibilities
  _because_ of the struggles involved, not in spite of them.


  Increasingly, entrepreneurs and leaders are faced with intense competition,
  scarcity of resources and unforgiving markets. The role of leadership is to
  keep people focused on what matters most and what has value, in spite of the
  turbulence that surrounds us.


  The first question he poses is about fundamentals. The fundamentals which
  Badaracco wishes us to grasp is “to understand the swirling context around
  organizations today and set a sound direction.”


  In his discussion about accountability, the second question, Badaracco offers
  a thought-provoking quote. “Quis custodies ipsos custodies?” (Translation: Who
  guards the guardians?)


  The guardians are those individuals or groups with power over other people.
  The guardians are the leaders. Who keeps the guardians in check? We are all
  familiar with stories like Enron’s collapse and corruption in other high
  places of business and government to be aware of that oversight.


  As we can see from our own leadership models, in business and politics, and
  holding leaders accountable for how they use their power, is an ongoing and
  fundamental challenge. How do you make sure that people are using their power
  appropriately?


  Yes, there are outside companies and oversight commissions that can be charged
  with this duty, but ultimately, accountability is governed by a set of
  standards that leaders create for themselves. These standards are internal and
  internalized.


  Self-accountability is directed by being knowledgeable about what we are
  trying to accomplish, and what counts as success vs. failure. Basically, “Are
  we doing the job that is needed, and are we doing it well?”


  Without clarity and oversight to control and guide how power is being used,
  self-serving interests can creep to the forefront of our thinking.


  Self-accountability requires confidence, determination, and the courage to
  accept that responsibility.


  Responsible leadership and leadership decision-making can be very demanding.
  It requires juggling information, moving people, and managing situations,
  often very quickly. Badaracco likens it to being like a spider managing a web.


  In due course, the rightness of our decision-making is fleshed out through the
  passage of time, through experimentation, experience, error, failure and
  serendipity. We “learn, adapt, and move roughly forward.”
f_conclusion: >-
  The central question that propels this book is “Why do leaders choose the role
  of leadership?” Why do people choose this life? It is not because of money or
  position. Or, not these things alone.
