  ### Stop Trying So Hard


  > "It can take years to become an overnight sensation."- The Greatness Guide:
  Book 2, page 98


  When is enough enough? When can you stop pushing the boulder up the hill, take
  a step back, look at the progress you’ve made, and realize that you have done
  all you can to accomplish your goal? There comes a point when you need to stop
  trying and just relax.


  Imagine a farmer who wanted to get more productivity out of his fields, so to
  do so he started harvesting before the crops were ripe. This is what I’m
  talking about. Success is as much about timing as it is about effort. In some
  cases, you can’t rush things any more than a farmer can rush his crops. Which
  is not to suggest that you should put anything less than 100% into something
  you truly believe in and want.


  Absolutely, be meticulous. Think brilliantly. Act courageously. Give it your
  all. But then… let it go. Find satisfaction in the fact that you put
  everything you had into it, and have the faith to let life run its course.
  Just like the farmer, there is a time for work, and there are the times you
  just need to relax, slow down and enjoy the moment. There will be time to work
  hard again soon, promise.

  ### Love the Journey


  > "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you
  didn’t do than by the ones you did. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from
  the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream.
  Discover."- Mark Twain, as quoted in The Greatness Guide: Book 2, page 86


  I have a friend who started working at one of the big three motor companies
  when he was seventeen. Within two weeks he hated it. He’s thirty years old now
  and still working in the same job. Still hates it. I asked him recently why he
  would subject himself to 50 hours a week of something he loathed. His
  response? “I’m on track to retire at 55. Then I’m going to enjoy myself.” I
  find that sad. It’s sort of like being on a road trip, but focusing
  exclusively on the destination. In life (as in road trips!) the joy is in the
  journey. It’s in the detours; the people, places and events you experience
  along the way.


  Hey, have a map, no question. Have a destination, definitely. But just
  remember to take in some of the scenery along the way. In the immortal words
  of Ferris Bueller, “life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop to look around,
  you just might miss it.”


  _“So make tomorrow special. No, make it outrageously great. Wildly wonderful.
  A piece of art – one that you can tell your grandkids about.”_

  ### Smile: It’s good for business.


  > "No one will take you seriously if you take yourself too seriously."- The
  Greatness Guide: Book 2, page 62


  When’s the last time you laughed at yourself? Or more appropriately, when was
  the last time that you should have laughed at yourself, but didn’t?


  It turns out, we’re all human. (Who knew?) And yet, for some reason, many of
  us are terrified of making a mistake, proving our humanity, and having those
  around us see us as less than perfect. People who are able to laugh at their
  mistakes and not take themselves too seriously exude confidence to those
  around them. Through humor they’re able to show that they understand life to
  be a journey, and that along that journey we are bound to make mistakes.
  Ironically, people who take themselves too seriously do so because they
  believe that to show humility or a sense of humor at their own expense makes
  them appear weak. Nothing could be further from the truth. People respect and
  look up to people who are willing to admit they were wrong; willing to learn
  from their mistakes. Respect yourself, definitely. But why pretend you’re
  incapable of error?
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Greatness Guide: Book 2_ is a reminder of what’s really important in
  life. Goals, dreams and ambitions are amazing – we need to embrace our pursuit
  of those things to give our lives direction. Put everything you’ve got into
  your dreams. Just remember to enjoy the process. Life would be pretty boring
  if we had complete control over what happened to us along the way. Embrace the
  unexpected. Relax. Smile. Love the journey.
