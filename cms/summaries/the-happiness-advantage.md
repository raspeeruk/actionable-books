  ### Change is Possible


  > "It’s more than a little comforting to know that people can become happier,
  that pessimists can become optimists, and that stressed and negative brains
  can be trained to see more possibility."- The Happiness Advantage, page 31


  Advances in the field of neuroplasticity show that the human brain has
  enormous growth potential. We don’t know the limits, but we do know that
  science has proven that brains can and do change and grow, that there are
  numerous ways we can rewire our brains, and that adopting the habits that
  improve our mindset have proven, long-lasting effects.


  Of course, this knowledge doesn’t guarantee the results described. It takes
  practice. Fortunately for us, Achor provides proven ways that we can practice
  happiness – thereby changing our brains AND our lives.

  ### Happiness Habits


  > "Each activity listed below not only gives us a quick boost of positive
  emotions, improving our performance and focus in the moment; but if performed
  habitually over time, each has been shown to help permanently raise our
  happiness baseline."- The Happiness Advantage, page 51


  I started practicing a few of these habits earlier in the year and found that
  just remaining cognizant of the fact that I could _in the moment_ improve my
  positivity has been a boon to my life and mental health. So, Achor’s
  elaboration on these habits, and what they might look like for each of us gave
  me even more tools to support my daily happiness and to reset my happiness
  baseline. The habits are:


  1\. **Meditate** – Regular meditation, even just five minutes a day,
  permanently rewires our brains to “raise our levels of happiness, lower
  stress, and improve immune function.” _Happier and healthier!_


  2\. **Find Something to Look Forward to** – Anticipating future rewards lights
  up the pleasure centers of our brains in the same ways that the actual reward
  does. Think about chocolate. Mmmm.


  3\. **Commit _Conscious_ Acts of Kindness** – “Acts of altruism decrease
  stress and contribute to enhanced mental health.” To get the most cognitive
  benefit, acts of kindness should be deliberate and conscious. Pick a day and
  commit to five acts of kindness. Buy coffee for the person behind you in the
  drive through. Send an encouraging email.


  4\. **Infuse Positivity Into Your Surroundings** – Make your place of work a
  positive space, take a break mid-day, avoid negative emotions. Even just
  “spending 20 minutes outside in good weather not only boost\[s\] positive
  mood, but broaden\[s\] thinking and improve\[s\] working memory.”


  5\. **Exercise** – This one sounds simple, but is sadly, often the first thing
  we sacrifice when our lives become stressful. But research shows that exercise
  releases endorphins and improves our mood – and it’s not just a short-term
  effect. 45 minutes of activity three times per week resulted in a significant
  improvement in mental health for depressed patients for more than six months.


  6\. **Spend Money (but Not on Stuff)** – Research shows that spending money on
  experiences and activities rather than on material purchases makes us happier
  in the moment and over time. Go to a concert, bring donuts to the office, send
  flowers to your spouse.


  7\. **Exercise a Signature Strength** – When we do the things that we are good
  at and that are tied to our character traits, we reap lasting benefits and
  again, increase our baseline happiness level. This is more than just “pursuing
  your passion.” It’s the daily practice of the very strengths that make you
  you. If you’re unsure, take this free survey to find out:

  ### Happiness Gives Your Brain the Competitive Edge


  > "When we are happy – when our mindsets and mood are positive – we are
  smarter, more motivated, and thus more successful. Happiness is the center,
  and success revolves around it."- The Happiness Advantage, page 37


  It can be difficult to define happiness. Positivity, positive emotions, human
  flourishing, all can be used to describe the phenomenon and emotional state of
  happiness. In an analysis of more than 200 scientific studies on nearly
  275,000 people, researchers consistently found that “happiness leads to
  success in every domain of our lives.”


  Imagine that successful life – a happy marriage, good health, strong
  friendships, creativity, and success in business. The success of everything we
  commit ourselves to hinges on those positive emotions. And it’s not just
  personal. **Businesses and organizations whose people practice happiness
  habits find higher performance, more motivation, and a more enjoyable work
  environment.** Happiness affects everything we do.
f_conclusion: >-
  I’ll be the first to admit that my natural happiness baseline is neutral or
  slightly negative. **But by incorporating many of these habits into my daily
  life, I can report a noticeable increase in my positivity.** And people –
  friends, colleagues, and family – have noticed.

  "Happiness is the precursor to success, not merely the result…happiness and
  optimism actually fuel performance and achievement."

> "Happiness is the precursor to success, not merely the result…happiness and optimism actually fuel performance and achievement." _\- The Happiness Advantage, page 4_

I must admit that my introduction to Shawn Achor was from his now-famous TED Talk, [**The Happy Secret to Better Work**](http://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work.html).

It was from viewing his speech that I realized I needed to learn more about his research findings, so that I, too, could raise my happiness level – not just on a moment-by-moment basis but in a way that’s more enduring. What surprised me was that his writing clearly reflects his personality and enthusiasm for his subject of study, bringing the research to life and making this book an enchanting read.

But in addition to providing personal tips for raising my own happiness baseline, I learned ways that my business and my company could benefit from increased happiness. In ways both tangible and intangible. Individuals and businesses showed remarkable improvements in personal success by instituting Achor’s practices. The main takeaway, of course, is that **increasing happiness increases success rather than vice versa.**

For me, exercise, experiences, and practicing my strengths have made the most impact in my attitude. And as I’ve started to pay more attention to my happiness levels, I can correlate lowered happiness with neglect of the very practices that empower me. I’d say it’s working, and I encourage you to try it, too.

**_What about you?_** Do you have a happiness baseline? Do you already practice any of the habits mentioned? What has been the result? If you’re not practicing any of these habits, is there something else that works for you? And if you’re not practicing these habits, which ones most appeal to you?
