  ### The Pursuit = Long-Term Happiness


  > "If you’re doing something you love, it doesn’t matter that it’s
  challenging. You can keep going for a long time as long as you’re motivated."-
  The Happiness of Pursuit, page 163


  Every quest is personal and unique in nature. Generally speaking though, each
  quest that Guillebeau shares in _The Happiness of Pursuit_ took many months or
  several years to complete. Guillebeau’s own quest of visiting every country in
  the world took him several years to complete, though he set the goal of
  completing it by the time he was 35. But what emerges from the many anecdotes
  in the book is that the process (or pursuit) is what ultimately makes people
  happy.


  Guillebeau also talks about this as a “love of the craft.” A great example of
  this is Seth Godin’s relentless dedication to daily writing with no
  exceptions, in addition to publishing at least a book per year. He shared some
  additional examples of other prolific writers and bloggers, but what I
  appreciated most about his observations about them and other questers is this
  – “Effort can be its own reward if you let it.” In our overly stimulated, over
  complicated lives, it’s comforting to think that just effort can be enough.

  ### When It’s Over, There’s Still More


  > "When you’ve given everything you have in pursuit of something great, it’s
  hard to toss off a few quick sentences on 'what it’s like.'"- The Happiness of
  Pursuit, page 245


  From my personal experience of achieving big goals, there can be this odd lull
  that follows. Sometimes it can feel anti-climactic or it can feel like a case
  of the blues. For especially big quests like walking across the US or
  extensively travelling, returning the “regular life” can also be a tough
  transition. So how can we manage this?


  Guillebeau suggests that even when a quest is over, there’s always more to be
  had. We will find new quests. We can revel in our past ones. We can continue
  to find meaning in our lives through what we have achieved. In particular, we
  can focus on the stories that emerged from the quest. Guillebeau talks about
  his experiences of being interviewed about visiting 193 countries and while it
  can be a difficult experience to summarize he can tell stories, which
  generally tend to be more meaningful.


  The parting words about memorializing, but not idolizing what we have
  accomplished were very moving. I think so often when we have achieved
  something great, it can be easy to live in the past and long for more times
  like that. Instead, it’s best to keep our momentum, remember the stories and
  go forth to our next quest.

  ### Know What Your Goal Requires


  > "If you want to prioritize adventure, something’s got to give."- The
  Happiness of Pursuit, page 100


  Just about every book on productivity and goal setting will tell you that in
  order to maximize your chances of success, you need to understand exactly what
  your goal requires. Guillebeau applies this same framework to the concept of a
  quest. In this case he suggests mapping out the following:


  *   **Goal** – What is the clear, specific goal you are trying to reach?

  *   **Time** – What is your deadline for achieving the goal?

  *   **Money** – How much money will be required for you to achieve the goal?

  *   **Other Costs** – What else is required for this goal?

  *   **Unknown** – Questions, concerns and uncertainties about achieving the
  goal.


  Since quests are long-term undertakings that require a substantial commitment,
  Guillebeau recommends small, incremental changes as a part of the adjustment
  process.

> "There is a lot of distraction for people, so you might not ever find the real you." _\- Bob Dylan, as quoted in The Happiness of Pursuit, page 47_

Are you currently on a quest? You know – a big, audacious journey to achieve what seems like an impossible feat? Surprisingly all around the world there are countless people undertaking amazing quests. Quests that are physical in nature, quests that push the boundaries of a personal group, quests that build community and so on. In his latest book, _The Happiness of Pursuit_, Chris Guillebeau explores why people undertake quests and the value that they add to their lives.

Guillebeau defines a quest as an adventure driven by a big idea that includes a willingness to take action and meet a deadline. Sometimes they start off as small life experiments that eventually evolve into a bigger quest. Other times they are born out of childhood dreams. But the common thread of all of the quests that Guillebeau documents in _The Happiness of Pursuit_ is all of the people continue their quests because of the richness and meaning that it brings to their lives.
