  ### Ask Yourself: What Makes Me Happy Within My Life?


  > "This is my life, but I never give any thought to it."- The Happiness
  Project, page 2


  What are some of the things that make you feel good in your life? When you’re
  working, when you’re at home or when you’re someplace else? This is not about
  the big things, like finding a partner, starting a business or moving to a new
  country, but the little day-to-day things that make all the difference. Little
  things like taking a walk at lunch, brainstorming with a colleague instead of
  working alone, or asking for help when you need it.


  The goal here is to **actively** assess activities and aspects of your life,
  with the intention of monitoring them for happiness triggers.

  ### What Makes You Feel Good?


  > "Happiness is a critical factor for work, and work is a critical factor for
  happiness."- The Happiness Project, page 112


  What makes you feel good? Completing a big project, achieving a significant
  goal, getting promoted? Of course these things make people feel good, but
  what’s something that you could do differently _right_ _now_ that will make a
  difference to your happiness?


  When I’m working on a project that involves thinking and writing, I used to
  feel that sitting at my desk, making notes and then typing was the best way to
  get it done. Recently, I noticed that if I review my notes and remind myself
  of the outline and deliverables, then immediately take a break and go for a
  walk, I have better ideas in a shorter space of time and I enjoy the process
  more. I come back to my desk with a clear picture of what to do and the energy
  to do it. Challenging my assumptions about what makes me happy in my work led
  me to make a small change that had a big impact.

  ### What's Bothering You?


  > "Tackle a Nagging Task."- The Happiness Project, page 34


  How are your energy levels? Boosting your energy not only makes you feel good
  and raises your self-esteem, it also has the positive knock-on effect that
  you’ll be better able to take more actions that make you feel happy. What are
  some things in your life that sap your energy levels and what can you do about
  it?


  Gretchen identified resolutions for January that would help her to feel more
  energized. She realized that lack of sleep, poor exercise and clutter drained
  her of energy so she took action to improve those areas.


  In my work, my file folder of receipts that I had not organized or entered
  into a spreadsheet was bothering me. I was bothered by it every day, just a
  little, each time I put another receipt into that file. It was always in the
  back of my mind and it was sapping my mental energy. I decided to tackle it
  the lazy way: rather than spend a few more hours in my office one evening, I
  handed the file and instructions to an assistant that I hired on a casual
  basis.


  The relief that this gave me was unexpected. Having removed this task from the
  back of mind, I felt creatively free. I found myself with head space to
  consider my goals and plans for next year. I experienced a lightness that
  helped me to tackle more interesting work. I felt more productive and
  _happier._
f_conclusion: >-
  Once I finished reading _The Happiness Project_ I realized that I wasn’t
  interested in the disciplined approach that Gretchen applied to this topic,
  with charts and resolutions for every month. But, I found that reading about
  happiness makes me happy. I found that by looking for small things to do
  differently I increased my feelings of happiness, within my already happy
  life. How can you do the same?

I resisted reading _The Happiness Project_ for some time. It seemed like I was admitting to being unhappy, which I’m not. However, I was intrigued by the concept and finally picked it up an airport. When I started reading, I couldn’t stop. Gretchen Rubin has an engaging style that made this book a joy to read and to consider how some of her experiences could relate to my life.

Gretchen Rubin is a successful writer living in New York City. She reflected one day that she had many things to be happy about in her life, but wasn’t always _feeling_ happy. She concluded that she wanted to change how she felt, without making changes to her life. Or, as she puts it “I wanted to change my life without changing my life.” To achieve this, she embarked on a one-year Happiness Project. Spanning one year, she tracks her progress against monthly resolutions designed to increase her feelings of happiness in her life. Her resolutions include increasing energy by going to sleep earlier, challenging herself by launching a blog and writing a novel just for the fun of it. While researching happiness, she found that she learned more from reading one person’s detailed account than she did from reading research and studies. In this spirit, she shares with us her experiences, opening her life to her readers so that we might be inspired to make some changes too.
