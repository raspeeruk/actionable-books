  ### The Heart of the Process


  > "It is clear that if we are to shift people's behaviours, we must ultimately
  shift their underlying beliefs."- The Heart of Coaching, page 40


  Crane has studied at great length the strengths and limitations \[especially
  the limitations\] of other coaching models to come up with the basis for his
  model. He distinguishes his method of coaching based on nine principles:


  1.  It is data driven.

  2.  It is performance focused.

  3.  It is relationship focused.

  4.  It is slower, not faster.

  5.  It requires dialogue.

  6.  It requires more heart.

  7.  It requires humility.

  8.  It requires balance.

  9.  It requires self-responsibility.


  The Transformational Coaching Paradigm is one in which “feedback flows up,
  down and sideways throughout an organization”. No longer is coaching a top
  down approach that allows for the boss to coach or, in most cases, ‘tell’ a
  direct report what to do or how to think. This is true empowerment at its
  core. Crane’s method allows for a working environment of growth and
  fulfillment, that provides creative choices that allow for a sense of personal
  ownership, an opportunity to contribute to significant goals where employees
  are treated with honesty and coaches both challenge and support
  accomplishments. Wow! I want to work for an organization that follows these
  coaching guidelines!

  ### Words really do make a difference!


  > "Coaches need to heighten their awareness and sensitivity to the words they
  use, becoming aware of the emotional energy and the impact they have on people
  ... a single word can change an attitude."- The Heart of Coaching, page 97


  Crane writes an entire chapter on _‘Coaching Language’_ and another on
  _‘Coaching Through Dialogue’_ to demonstrate to the reader how words
  influence, build up or tear down, the relationships we have with others. It
  was a fascinating look at how the listener’s expectations change depending on
  the speaker’s words, words which we often think are synonymous and yet are not
  really and therefore can have potentially disastrous results.


  Using inclusive language, we or I as opposed to you, helps to build a
  collaborative and trusting relationship and may go a long way to diminish the
  defensive mechanism individuals use to resist coaching. Crane uses examples of
  ‘should vs. could’; ‘but vs. and’; ‘try vs. will’ to demonstrate his point
  that we as coaches need to be very conscientious of the words we choose and
  the effects they have on others. As well, the use of jargon can potentially
  confuse and disrupt the coaching cycle by setting up a ‘sense of exclusivity’
  or elitism. Simpler is better; common language “facilitates understanding by
  more people.”


  Crane discusses the importance of reframing situations for clients and points
  to this skill as being key for successful coaches. Taking common words such as
  ‘always’ and ‘never’ and instead using ‘sometimes’, or taking ‘can’t’ as
  ‘won’t’ or, my favourite, removing the word ‘mistakes’ and in its place using
  the word ‘learning’. These seemingly small changes will potentially have huge
  windfalls for both the coach and client.

  ### A coach is very different from a boss!


  > "A coach acts as a guide by challenging and supporting people in achieving
  their personal and organizational performance objectives. If this is done as a
  trusted learning partner, people feel helped by the coach and the process ...
  help is only help if it's perceived as help."- The Heart of Coaching, page 31


  The idea that a coach \[boss/superior\] is equal to the subordinate
  \[employee\] is truly transformational! The altering of traditional job
  descriptions changes the entire process of coaching; both behaviours and
  relationships. Built on mutual trust and respect, the end results are more
  resourceful and creative as well as being more likely to last. No fast fixes
  that last a short time when old behaviours become easier to fall back on. The
  longevity of new modifications is a result of true change based on working
  with emotional intelligence and self responsibility. By “\[engaging\] in
  candid respectful coaching conversations with one another – unrestricted by
  reporting relationships – … they can improve their working relationships and
  individual and collective work performance.”


  Instead of having a boss, Crane suggests what is needed instead is a leader.
  Crane combines and identifies five roles that should be the core of business
  leadership: visionary, servant \[to serve others within their organization\],
  coach, facilitator and role model. These positions have overlapping
  responsibilities and they can be trimmed down to training, counseling,
  confronting, and mentoring. His ‘vision’ of applied leadership creates what he
  describes as a “feedback-rich” environment to develop and improve staff.
f_conclusion: >-
  According to Crane, gone are the days when business coaches direct or lecture,
  know all the answers, trigger insecurities using fear and/or point to all the
  errors. Instead, the new coach supports, listens, engages in dialogue,
  stimulates creativity and facilitates by empowering. What a wonderful
  environment for both personal as well as organizational growth!

> "The Transformational Coaching process provides a useful framework to guide performance coaching discussions in ways that open up communications and build trust. It also creates a powerful commitment to mutual learning and partnership for discovering the next best steps." _\- The Heart of Coaching, page 15_

At its core, the process in Thomas G. Crane’s _The Heart of Coaching_ consists of three parts: the foundation, the feedback loop and the forwarding-the-action phase. Not too much, right? And yet so much more! Crane takes each phase and breaks it down into his most basic steps. Each chapter represents a sub-section in the coaching cycle which at its base is a series of powerful communication tools to help develop individuals as well as advance organizational change.

I found this book so chock full of wisdom that it was very difficult to come up with just the few mentioned in this summary. I believe if you are interested in taking the next step in your coaching role, whether as a full time coach or as merely to add a line in your job description, this is the book for you. You will come away with many insights, new tips and techniques to take your coaching skills to the next level.

The following quote from Eddie Robinson, Head Football Coach at Grambling University, opens one of the chapters and I think speaks to the heart of coaching: “Coaching is a profession of love. You can’t coach people unless you love them.” So my question to you is do you love your staff and/or clients enough to read and implement the coaching skills in this book?
