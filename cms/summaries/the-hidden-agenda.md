  ### What Lies at the Heart of Every Pitch and is Universal in its Application


  > "The Hidden Agenda is the unspoken, emotional motivation that resides in the
  heart of your audience. This emotional core is the true motivator behind every
  decision."- The Hidden Agenda, page 19


  Lately, it has become fashionable to utilize the teachings of ‘persuasion
  science’ to connect, compel and motivate movement in the sales process. “The
  Hidden Agenda”, while not rejecting the studies that support the importance of
  persuasion, gently pushes those findings aside to advance the idea that to
  establish a collaborative relationship with another we must create an
  emotional, human connection … and get to the heart of the matter.


  By spending time to understand your prospects’ emotional motivations and
  digging deep into discerning the unstated motivations of the person, we can
  set the stage for a powerful and successful outcome that benefits all parties
  in the process.


  While there are many different categories of hidden agendas, they can be
  grouped into three primary categories and understanding them will provide a
  foundation to unearth what the hidden agenda is for your prospect. They are:


  **WANT:** This is based upon ambition. People in this category generally have
  an optimistic view of the future and will respond to bold gestures. You must
  convince them that you understand their work, can see what they see and that
  you are excited to become part of their journey.


  **NEEDS:** This one is linked to fear and the prospect has a sense that
  ‘something is missing, is lacking’. A feeling of urgency lurks and the call to
  action for the pitch revolves around a “call for confidence’’. These people
  tend to be more quiet, reserved, and cautious. Give them assurance that you
  can deliver.


  **VALUES:** These people are motivated by values that are connected to deeply
  held beliefs, which they continually connect an issue to. Their actions are
  set, calibrated and measured inside their value system. They will respond to
  your ability to connect an over-arching vision to those core values.


  When you identify the hidden agenda and ‘connect your strengths, beliefs, and
  ambitions to this hidden agenda, you win.’ **But so does the person you are
  pitching.**

  ### The Win Strategy – Leveraging Who You Are


  > "Winning occurs when a shared bond is created with your audience through
  connecting your leverage-able assets – your real ambition, your credo, or your
  core – to your audience’s hidden agenda."- The Hidden Agenda, page 149


  Let’s talk about the resources of who you are – what you bring to the party
  that can be leveraged to enhance the connection and quicken the success of
  finding the hidden agenda. There are three core elements that can help uncover
  the hidden agenda when talking about your personal assets. They are your
  **core**, your **credo,** and your **real ambition**.


  **Your Core:** It is your essence, your special abilities that are used to
  connect to the needs of your prospect. It is a deep understanding of all of
  your life experiences and how those add value in a way that people will listen
  to and then follow you.


  **Your Credo:** Credo means ‘I believe’ and connects “to the values, because
  it is a belief system you and your audience share.” The credo represents a
  code of ethics, behavior and belief. Crystallize your belief system and you
  will forge a bond that will galvanize your prospect to align with you. The
  actions that a person or company takes are a reflection of their credo.


  **The Real Ambition:** “The human desire to create something good where
  nothing existed before.” It is not a _hope for_, it is a _will be_ that will
  be pursued relentlessly. Real ambition has a clear intent, it moves to achieve
  the impossible and it requires action along with the belief. It will make you
  feel nervous and excited, at the same time. It is the engine of your pitch.


  Though the book was written for the professional ‘pitch man’ and has a bias
  towards corporation concerns, it is easily read and applied to a small
  business and entrepreneurial orientation. The message for the person pitching
  is not ‘buy me’ but ‘_join me’_.

  ### Uncovering the Hidden Agenda


  > "Uncovering the hidden agenda requires you to get close to your prospect and
  to listen carefully to read the emotional subject at hand. It means asking
  questions that open the window to your audience’s emotional motivation."- The
  Hidden Agenda, page 58


  Here’s how you do it. Begin with the connection. **Slow down, listen
  carefully, and raise your antennae to receive the signals the other personal
  is transmitting.** “What is required is emotional insight, human sensitivity,
  thoughtfulness, empathy and _very_ good listening skills.”


  There are five key steps in locating the hidden agenda:


  1\. **_Prepare:_** Before the pitch, estimate what lies in the heart of the
  prospect and how you’ll respond to what’s there. You should arrive at any
  meeting with a hypothesis as to what category their hidden agenda might be.


  2\. **_Be Receptive:_** It’s not about your product or service, it’s all about
  them. The objective is not to show off what you are presenting but to get them
  to reveal and share the things you need to know about their lives. Be aware of
  the rules of good body language and look for an emotional vein that will lead
  you to their desire.


  3\. **_Think like a Shrink:_** Before the pitch, ask: “What makes them tick?”,
  “Who is this person?”, and “What kind of personality profile are they?”


  4\. **_Listen the Right Way:_** It’s the smart one who stays quiet. Through
  listening you can get to the core of a person. Develop ‘emotional x-ray
  vision’ by understanding that good listening skills are an act of generosity.


  5\. **_Ask the Right Questions:_** Functional Questions = Functional Answers.
  Ask questions that “invite the prospect to express {his/her} views, feelings,
  and instincts…the answers will reveal the elements of the hidden agenda.”
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Hidden Agenda_ is about emotionally bonding with your prospect by taking
  the time to figure out their unspoken, emotional needs and connecting your
  pitch to those needs. The search for the hidden agenda is a search for desire.
  Uncover these unspoken desires and what your prospects hold dear and they will
  follow you. When you ferret out and indentify those needs, and then connect
  the pitch directly to them, you win and your prospect wins.

  "It all boils down to the act of stirring someone to join you – to agree to
  follow you. Yet we consistently underestimate how critical it is to recognize
  the needs, spoken and unspoken, of the decision maker."

**You pitch something every day.** When you have an idea. When you sell a product or service. Have to convince someone to come alongside your thinking on an issue? Well, you have to present your point of view in order to have it accepted. _The Hidden Agenda: A Proven Way to Win Business and Create a Following_ presents a framework to help understand what the prime motivators are that lie behind all the research and business jargon that results in winning someone over to your side.

Author Kevin Allen, a modern-day, jet-setting advertising ‘Mad Man’, maintains that there is presumption behind _every_ business decision to buy where there is ‘an unspoken emotional motivation’ that can sway a success of the pitch and this is… ‘the hidden agenda’.
