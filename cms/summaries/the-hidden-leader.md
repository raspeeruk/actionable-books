  ### What’s in a Title?


  > "…someone’s contribution to the value of a business need not be constrained
  by that person’s position on the organization chart"- The Hidden Leader, page
  187


  What really defines these internal leaders as hidden rests with the idea that
  they are only hidden from management because they may fall outside the
  traditional definition of a leader. However, if you listen to the employees
  who work alongside these individuals, they can easily identify these hidden
  leaders as smart, crucial to the business and effective members of a team.
  These hidden leaders are often frontline employees, who lack a formal
  leadership title, but they are also the ones everyone goes to solve tough
  problems, provide the realistic perspective or orient a new employee to the
  cultural ways of the organization. Inherent in displaying these competencies
  is accountability. Hidden leaders view themselves as having the authority and
  even the responsibility to make decisions, follow actions through to
  completion and reach goals. As business leaders, it is important that we look
  for those without a title, who work more closely with our customers than we
  do, and support them in stretching the boundaries of our processes, guidelines
  and internal structures to make decisions. Decisions that surpass the
  expectations of our customers and propel our businesses forward.

  > "Doing something – anything – achieves results faster than trying to
  eliminate ambiguity with facts, research or knowledge"- The Hidden Leader,
  page 59


  I once worked with a leader who told me that the one definite, incorrect
  action in a situation is the act of not making a decision. Although the
  decisions are not always 100% right, it is always better to make a decision
  than to forego making a decision and get lost in the world of grey. Action
  breeds more action whereas standing still gives someone else the opportunity
  to step over and make that decision. This insight builds upon one of the five
  characteristics mentioned under the previous insight – an owner’s mindset.
  Even small decisions are critical to the ongoing success of business. Like the
  authors, I agree that good decision making and integrity and honesty go hand
  in hand. Hidden leaders view their decisions in light of the impact they will
  have on others much like they view their actions in light of the impact on the
  customer experience. It is also important to remember that because hidden
  leaders display a high level of integrity, they are able to make decisions
  that build trust instead of eroding it. Even if the wrong decision is made, as
  long as it is made with good intentions and a balanced approach, a hidden
  leader will be able to bridge the gap.

  This book introduced me to a new concept: “customer purposed”. It is a
  not-so-subtle difference, but customer purposed is definitely not customer
  service although the two concepts may have some traits in common. Customer
  purposed is the epitome of alignment in business. Essentially it is the action
  of proactively envisioning how a task affects the value provided to the
  customer displayed across five characteristics:


  *   Enthusiasm for Work

  *   Balanced skill/Communications proficiency

  *   A sense of urgency

  *   An owner’s mindset

  *   Being a champion of change


  Wow! Any one of the five characteristics above are easily actionable and I
  would argue also contagious for those who have the privilege of working
  alongside these individuals. When I see someone who is working in this manner,
  I find myself saying….I want that! Finding value and meaning in the work you
  do is a true driver of engagement. Hidden leaders have a deep understanding of
  the value promise of an organization and take the steps required (within the
  organizational guidelines) to ensure each customer has that experience. What a
  fabulous connection to employee engagement and the opportunity to take a
  second look at those front line employees that may be a huge talent pool of
  hidden leaders.
f_conclusion: >-
  When I first picked up this book I thought it would provide me tips, tools and
  resources to become a better leader. Even though I have the traditional title,
  I recognize there is always room to improve. When I finally put this book
  down, I felt a greater responsibility to go looking for those in my
  organization that are in a better position than I am to advance my
  organization one customer interaction at a time. In one way or another, almost
  anyone within an organization has the opportunity to become a hidden leader.
  And….if this is the case, what’s stopping them? Adopting a very provocative
  position, do you think it is possible to create a very successful organization
  that has a minimum amount of hierarchy, a decent set of guiding principles and
  one heck of a large cadre of hidden leaders who are passionate about what they
  do and are able to align their actions to driving their business forward
  faster and better than their competitors? As an HR leader, perhaps my role is
  to hire hidden leaders and then step out of the way and let them do great
  work!

What sets Scott K. Edinger and Laurie Sain’s _The Hidden Leader: Discover and Develop Greatness Within your Company_ apart from many of the other books I have read on leadership is the degree to which the book is interactive. Whether it is the many worksheets, analytical tools or online resources, everything about the book meets the description of actionable. Not only does this book seek to describe the hidden leader but it seeks to advocate on behalf of the hidden leader to the organization, compelling the organization to create an environment that supports their ongoing success.

From a content perspective, there are two important, overarching ideas that form the basis for this book:

1.  Hidden leaders are energy and innovation powerhouses within an organization.
2.  Organizations or leaders who recognize the potential of hidden leaders can maximize their value to create more successful organizations.

Essentially, hidden leaders are a very compelling, untapped competitive advantage.

The information and tools in the book are organized in a straightforward three step process:

1.  Identify hidden leaders and those who have potential.
2.  Evaluate their strengths and areas of opportunity.
3.  Identify cultural aspects or processes in your organizations to help develop hidden leaders.

One of the perspectives I appreciated most about this book was that it did not divorce leadership from the culture of the organization. Hidden leaders or leaders of any kind are not magic bullets in isolation. Even the best leader in the wrong environment will find it challenging to be successful. It is the alignment of leader and culture that can really alight change and progress.
