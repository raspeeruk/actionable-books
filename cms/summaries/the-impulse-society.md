  ### I’ll Have it My Way


  > "To personalize is, in effect, to reject the world ‘as is,’ and instead to
  insist on bending it to our preferences."- The Impulse Society, page 129


  Chapter 5, entitled “Home Alone”, was my BAZINGA chapter! In the age of the
  smart phone and other instant technology, it’s not news that Americans live in
  our own personal realities. We have the ability to have exactly what we want,
  when we want it, and if it takes very long we’ll get it somewhere else.


  The age of American manufacturing and prosperity after World War II was the
  first mark of the self-centered society we were moving toward. As technology
  and manufacturing improved, we began purchasing many things that we had made
  for ourselves in the past. We became consumers rather than producers because
  it was cheaper and easier to buy than to make. The more we consumed, the more
  manufacturers made for us to continue to consume. It was an endless cycle.


  Ultimately, consuming more and producing less gave us more free time. Free
  time evolved into the exploration of the self, and over the past several
  decades into the ultimate personalization of the world around us. Today’s
  technology has given us the ability to access any information at any time. We
  have turn-by-turn directions to our favorite restaurants, personalized music
  playlists for working out or cleaning the house, and social networks of
  hundreds or thousands of friends that will validate our feelings by liking our
  statuses. If we can’t personalize it, we don’t want it.


  The reason this was my BAZINGA chapter is because it helped flip the switch
  for me to have a greater understanding of my audience. I oversee social media
  and web content to support recruiters. Whether I’m brainstorming blog posts,
  memes, or video scripts, I will have to look for ways to make them
  individualized to particular groups of people. There is no one-size–fits-all
  post. I’ll have to divide my audience into groups of audiences and personalize
  my way into their worlds.

  ### How Instant Gratification has Shaped Health Care


  > "Our health care culture, with its endlessly snowballing cycles of
  innovation and expectation, has efficiently cultivated a sense of entitlement
  and self-service."- The Impulse Society, page 188


  Americans are medical consumers. Our instant gratification means that we want
  health now and we don’t care how much it costs. In fact, Roberts points out
  that the goal isn’t actually health, but health _care_. We refuse to
  acknowledge delayed gratification when it comes to thinking about our health.
  We seek longer lives but we don’t plan for them by making good, healthy
  choices along the way. We ask medicine to help us retain our youth in the form
  of things like cosmetic surgery and pills for erectile dysfunction.


  Several months ago my grandmother was hospitalized for a mild heart attack. I
  visited and even stayed the night in the hospital with her. For the first time
  I _really saw_ age and mortality. At the time I was a couple weeks into a
  nutrition challenge and preparing for a short race the following month. I’m
  generally in good health. I try to eat clean and exercise, although sometimes
  a healthy lifestyle is hard to maintain. Exercising has only been a priority
  for me off and on for the past few years and in all honesty that is mostly due
  to vanity. (Let’s face it; I’m a card-carrying member of Roberts’ Impulse
  Society.) After seeing my aging grandmother hospitalized, I certainly want to
  make better choices and take care of the only body I have. It’s clear to me,
  if not to other Americans, that no amount of medical care can halt aging. What
  was a big surprise to me is that our healthcare system is set up to encourage
  more and more medical consuming to treat illness than to encourage
  preventative care. We have to advocate for ourselves, sometimes push doctors
  to help us with preventative care, and focus on our own good health rather
  than consume what the healthcare industry hands to us.

  ### I’ll Do Anything…As Long as it’s Easy


  > "Consumer culture does everything in its considerable power to persuade us
  that adversity and difficulty and even awkwardness have no place in our
  lives."- The Impulse Society, page 130


  In earlier chapters, Roberts explores how manufacturing and finance changed,
  making Americans more mobile than ever before. This mobility provided the
  opportunities to move to cities, counties, and neighborhoods among like-minded
  people with similar lifestyles. While some argue that we are more global and
  tolerant of other cultures than ever, Roberts believes that we are, in fact,
  less so. As we surround ourselves with people that think like us, we become
  less tolerant of people and ideas that are not like ours. Time after time,
  when faced with an uncomfortable situation that may create an awkward
  interaction, people choose what is easy. Rather than discuss differing ideas
  or viewpoints, having a healthy debate, and then reaching a conclusion, people
  tend to avoid situations that may create an awkward exchange.


  My company recruits for direct sales positions. Direct sales is challenging.
  It’s different. We meet customers face to face in their homes, not in a store.
  It’s uncomfortable for many new reps because they have never experienced this
  type of sales presentation. Meeting with clients the way that we do pushes our
  new sales reps outside of their comfort zones. This book made it more clear
  than ever that as we move people from application to training to sales person,
  we must constantly reassure them that “different” and “uncomfortable” are
  feelings to be embraced, rather than run away from.

  Roberts is not without solutions. His final chapter, “Making Space” gives his
  thoughts on some of the changes he’s beginning to see in American society, as
  well as his thoughts on what else needs to take place for the pendulum to
  swing in the other direction. A groundswell is starting.

> "We’ve gone from being members of a ‘whole society’ to being competitors in a race for individual gratification." _\- The Impulse Society, page 231_

_The Impulse Society_ ranks in the top five books I’ve read in recent memory. Author Paul Roberts explores “America in the age of instant gratification” through the lenses of manufacturing, business, finance, politics, community (or a lack thereof) and health care. He mixes in the psychology of why we do what we do and how we have become such a me-centric society that consumes more and more over the past several decades.

Every chapter spoke to me in some way. As I said, this was one of the best books I’ve read recently, which made this one of the hardest summaries I’ve written to date. It was tough to narrow down the The Big Idea and Insights! I would absolutely LOVE to know what chapters spoke to you in the comments below.
