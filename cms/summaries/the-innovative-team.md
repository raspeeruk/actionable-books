  ### Divergent and Convergent Phases


  > "If we are going to be successful at getting some breakthrough thinking for
  our client, we need to understand a couple of things about the thinking
  process that will get us the results we are hoping for. The first thing to
  know is that at every stage of the process there are divergent and convergent
  phases."- The Innovative Team, page 42


  **The Breakthrough Thinking Process** is introduced in the story by a
  character named Kate Murdock. Kate has been assigned to lead a team of
  consultants that have recently received poor reviews from a client company.
  The client company had asked for an innovative solution to a problem and
  unfortunately felt that the consulting team had delivered a run-of-the-mill
  solution, anything but innovative. The four stages of the Breakthrough
  Thinking Process are the following:


  *   Clarify situation

  *   Generate ideas

  *   Develop solutions

  *   Implement plans


  Kate admits that all she has done is put names on the stages of innovation
  that everyone does naturally. She adds, however, that the key to making sure
  that innovation ultimately occurs through this process is in deliberately
  following it as a team and in focusing on diverging and converging at each
  stage.


  As Kate works her new team through the first stage, for example, she
  challenges them to come up with relevant new data and identify unexplored
  causes of the client company’s issue. By asking open ended questions and
  employing mind-mapping, Kate helps the team see that they hadn’t really
  considered all the data relevant to the client company’s situation. She slows
  the group down and makes sure they take time to diverge. Once she is satisfied
  that the team has uncovered enough potentially relevant data and possible
  causes, she has them converge by choosing which data is most relevant and most
  essential to understanding the client company’s challenge.

  ### Learn Others' Preferences


  > "If this team can identify and leverage its strengths, it’s going to get
  where it needs to go faster and with better results."- The Innovative Team,
  page 38


  In the story about the project team being led by Kate, each team member has a
  preference for a different part of the Breakthrough Thinking Process. Kate
  learned of her team members’ preferences in her first meeting with them as she
  described the process. The conversation among her team while she was
  describing each of the stages made it clear which stage each of the team
  members preferred. This knowledge helped her know which team member(s) to rely
  most heavily on at each of the stages and helped her move the team through the
  process successfully.


  **Learning the preferences of your team members is just as valuable as
  learning of their skills and relevant past experience.** If you are unable to
  uncover their preferences through conversation, don’t lose heart. The authors’
  website ([www.FourSightonline.com](http://www.foursightonline.com/)) includes
  a link to an assessment that will provide this information along with tips on
  how best to utilize each of the preferences.


  I’ve often taken pride in my ability to contribute to the generation of ideas
  part of the innovation process. After reading _The Innovative Team_, I’ll be
  looking for a greater variety of techniques to help with generating ideas.


  Which phase of the Breakthrough Thinking Process do you prefer? What have you
  done to cultivate your skills associated with that preference?

  ### Know Your Preference


  > "We all have different preferences when it comes to where we like to spend
  our time in the breakthrough thinking process."- The Innovative Team, page 49


  One of the best things you can do to maximize your effectiveness in the
  Breakthrough Thinking Process is to become more aware of which stage you have
  a preference for. Grivas and Puccio describe four main preferences, each
  corresponding to a stage in the Breakthrough Thinking Process (see below for
  preference labels and characteristics of people who tend to exhibit each of
  the preferences.)


  The following descriptions are from the authors’ website, _FourSight Online_.


  **Clarifiers** do their homework.


  They approach a challenge by digging through the facts, figures, and
  background data in search of greater insight. **They seek to understand before
  acting.** They move forward cautiously, researching, investigating, and asking
  questions to make sure the right challenge is being addressed. Their
  curiosity, patience, and persistence often pay off by affording them a more
  complete view of the situation.


  **Ideators** think big.


  They see things in global terms. They are fluent, flexible thinkers. They
  “get” the big picture and enjoy playing with ideas and possibilities. They
  like originality. They seek novelty. **Playful, imaginative, social, and
  adventurous,** Ideators are quick to generate original, out-of-the-box ideas.
  As such, they are celebrated players in the innovation process.


  **Developers** get things right.


  Faced with a rough concept or a broad idea, they like to refine it and shape
  it into a perfect solution. This tendency to strive for perfection can move an
  idea from half-baked to brilliant, making Developers a great asset to the
  innovation process. **Reflective, cautious, pragmatic, and plan-ful,**
  Developers can leverage their analytical minds and turn unproven concepts into
  workable solutions.


  **Implementers** get the job done.


  Full of energy and drive, they focus on moving forward. If there’s a problem,
  they’ll tackle it. If there’s an idea, they’ll test it. If there’s one thing
  they like, it’s a tangible outcome. Implementers are willing to learn as they
  go. **Persistent, decisive, determined and assertive,** the Implementer’s bias
  for action fuels the innovation process.


  **How and why would it be useful to identify your preference?** Well, just
  because you have a preference for a stage doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily
  skilled at that stage. Once you identify your preference, why not set out to
  acquire skills and techniques that would be useful to a group at that stage?
  For example, if you know that you are an Ideator, you could increase your
  effectiveness by learning techniques meant to help groups come up with ideas
  (brainstorming is not the only technique available.) Or, if you are a
  Developer, you might focus on learning various approaches to refining and
  perfecting ideas.

**I’d easily be a millionaire if I had a penny for every time a business leader put forth the need for companies and employees to innovate.**

While the need for innovation makes sense, the directive to innovate has always struck me as rather odd. I mean, doesn’t innovation in the business world occur _by chance_ when people are brought together to work on a project? Also, doesn’t innovation require the involvement of naturally _creative_ people? If so, it begs the question, **“if you’re not especially creative, do you even have a role in the innovation process?”**

In _The Innovative Team: Unleashing Creative Potential for Breakthrough Results_, Chris Grivas and Gerard J. Puccio, use a fictional narrative to introduce how adherence to a four stage process – **The Breakthrough Thinking Process** – and frequent, deliberate focus on where you are in the process, can make innovation possible for any team.
