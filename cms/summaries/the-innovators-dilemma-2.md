  ### Understanding failure with disruptive technologies


  > "Generally disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward,
  consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture
  that was often simpler in prior approaches"- The Innovator’s Dilemma, page 16


  While companies may have the resources to deliver these changes, it is back to
  the balance of understanding trends of the market: when is it the right time
  to make a change between the vision of a company vs. the reactions of a
  customer’s needs? To understand this, we must consider a couple things when
  dealing with disruptive technology. These points are:


  *   Is it straightforward and does it solve a problem consumers already see?

  *   Does it provide a tool that consumers never thought were feasible?


  When does it makes sense for a company to achieve a similar concept that
  delivers better performance or provides something new that wasn’t previously
  possible? Or how much control do the consumers that are able to influence
  certain trends have? By taking these points, not only does failure occur on a
  technology standpoint but also on an economical.


  While we may not be the next innovators within the disk drive industry or
  create a new piece of machinery for CAT or John Deere, we can still put these
  practices into play within our own workforce and come up with new initiatives
  to propel ourselves forward. With what we want to create and engage – whether
  it to be ourselves, colleagues or consumers – how do those factors come into
  play? Will it have an impact? And if it does, how?

  ### Appraising an organization’s capabilities and disabilities


  > "Managers who face the need to change or innovate, therefore, need to do
  more than assign the right resources to the problem. They need to be sure that
  the organization in which those resources will be working is itself capable of
  succeeding"- The Innovator’s Dilemma, page 193


  To follow through with the balance of disruptive technology and demands from
  the customer, the book offers a framework for companies to reflect upon
  themselves by understanding their own advantages and disadvantages. Will the
  disadvantages cause a disturbance and prohibit them from achieving their
  successful ideas? Clayton provides an “Organizational Capabilities Framework”
  companies to utilize when facing a shift within an organization’s model. The
  breakdown of the three categories are:


  1.  **Resources**


  *   Things or assets that can be physically brought into a company. Examples
  include new hires with desired skills, acquired products, new
  equipment/brand/designs and relationships built around the company.


  2.  **Processes**


  *   A series of patterns and steps taken to fine tune and transform the way a
  company provides its product to consumers.

  *   Steps include multiple different factors such as technology,
  communication, information, people who ensure that a task is executed
  frequently with minimal mistakes.


  3.  **Values**


  *   Prioritize the way a decision is made based on what is important for the
  company. This can be based on a technical, economical or social priority.


  These three categories overlap but pose a great exercise for leaders to take
  into consideration when constructing and reviewing their business model. Going
  back to that initial idea and concept that leaders wish to convey to their
  consumers, it is important to refer to the “Organizational Capabilities
  Framework” and applying these three categories. What disadvantages come up?
  How can they be resolved?

  ### Resource allocation


  > "Organizations will survive and prosper only if their staff and systems
  serve the needs of customers and investors by providing them with the
  products, services and profit they require"- The Innovator’s Dilemma, page 118


  Another balance to the scale is determined around the % of resource allocation
  that occurs within a company; how much of it is met based off of a customer’s
  demands vs. a company’s idea. The success of companies and innovation drives
  around the simplicity of balance between how much a company gives back to the
  demands of a customer. Tailor the technological innovations to resource
  dependence: customers _need_ the company’s product in order to survive, but
  also have companies fine tune those resources to reflect the demands that
  customers _deserve_.


  An example that you can use to take action immediately is to think about what
  it is you’re providing for your consumers and how it impacts them. Then think
  about what resources are available to make sure that your idea is properly
  executed. Is the right information being communicated properly? How is the
  staff adapting to the information provided? Is it enough to give back to the
  consumer or will it get lost? How will it impact the consumer who receives?
f_conclusion: >-
  While this book is tailored to challenge leaders within an organization, it
  provides thought-provoking concepts on how we can influence the actions and
  behaviours of our customers. By understanding the balance between sustaining
  and disruptive technologies, _The Innovator’s Dilemma_ encourages us to not
  only reflect on the reactions caused by our direct customers but challenge
  ways in which we can be proactive within our own organizations as well.

> "Markets that do not exist cannot be analyzed: Suppliers and customers must discover them together" _\- The Innovator’s Dilemma, page 165_

How does one change the game for an industry if it is yet to be discovered? When does it call to stay within the trends or leap ahead to fix a gap that a market doesn’t realize they need yet?

Clayton M Christensen takes these very questions to deliver answers around the world’s greatest innovators: the ups and downs parallel with theory of _disruptive technology_ within a specific market. Encouraging us to focus on these specific concepts, Clayton advises when it makes sense to:

*   Listen to customers
*   Invest in developing lower-performance products
*   Pursue small markets at the expense of larger ones

_The Innovator’s Dilemma_ challenges the fears that companies to this day face in ever changing technology: How do we stay ahead of the curve? How do we cater to our customers? What key factors are needed that won’t tip the scale? Through the detailed look of specific industries (e.g. The Disk Drive Industry and Mechanical Excavator Industry) we are able to visualize that while two companies can follow the exact same recipe, it doesn’t always churn out the same results. The reader is forced to revisit this notion of _disruptive vs. sustaining technology_ to come up with the decisions of what will be the balancing factors needed to assist the growth of their company and have it complement the growth of their customer’s needs.
