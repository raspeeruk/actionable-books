  ### Work with disruption, not against it


  > "If good management practice drives the failure of successful firms faced
  with disruptive technological change, then the usual answers to companies’
  problems—planning better, working harder, becoming more customer-driven, and
  taking a longer-term perspective—all exacerbate the problem..."- The
  Innovator’s Dilemma, Introduction


  Christensen’s answer for why successful companies fail revolves around the
  difference between sustaining innovations vs disruptive innovations.
  Sustaining innovations account for the majority of innovations, they improve
  an existing product usually helping to increase margins, while a disruptive
  innovation “transforms a product that historically has been complicated or
  expensive” into something that is more “accessible.” Often a disruptive
  product is of “inferior quality that with time is able to move up the market
  and eventually disrupt the previous market leaders.”


  Christensen explains that there are certain principles of disruptive
  innovation that must be followed in order to not be swallowed up in the
  disruption. He explains further by comparing adoption of the principles of
  disruption to man’s first attempt at flight. The first attempts at flight
  tried to succeed based on raw determination and bigger ideas, with larger
  wings attached to limbs at more elevated distances. It was only when man
  approached the problem by applying the principles of drag and lift that actual
  flight was the result. “When people then designed flying systems that
  recognized or harnessed the power of these laws and principles, rather than
  fighting them, they were finally able to fly to heights and distances that
  were previously unimaginable.” **Most people try and fight disruption and get
  lost in the battle rather than try to understand and work with its
  principles.**


  Christensen explains several Principles of Disruption relating to businesses.
  Two that are most relevant for businesses and individuals are:


  (1) “Failure is an intrinsic step toward success.”  

  (2) “The ultimate uses or applications for disruptive technologies are
  unknowable in advance.”

  ### Have a plan for learning, not execution


  > "I must therefore plan to be wrong and to learn what is right as fast as
  possible. I cannot spend all of my resources or all of my organizational
  credibility on an all-or-nothing first-time bet... I need to conserve
  resources to get it right on the second or third try."- The Innovator’s
  Dilemma, page 211


  **Learning rather than execution should be our focus when dealing with
  disruption.** Disruptive products are impossible to predict. Because they are
  disruptive we are unable to use the tools of prognostication that work with
  startling accuracy for sustaining innovations. Therefore, it is important that
  we maintain a learning focus rather than adhere to a predetermined approach.


  We know nothing about how we will use a disruptive product and therefore
  should not bet the proverbial farm on a potentially disruptive idea.
  Christensen uses the examples of tech giants who made big bets on a product
  they thought was going to disrupt the market such as Apple’s Newton or HP’s
  Kittyhawk drive that each company invested billions in but ultimately
  abandoned because the company could not adapt the product for sale.
  Christensen explains that companies who want to thrive because of disruption
  “need to fail early and inexpensively in the search for the market for a
  disruptive technology”. **To not be swept away with disruption we must be
  flexible and learn as we go.**

  ### Be active, not passive


  > "...managing better, working harder, and not making so many dumb mistakes is
  not the answer to the innovator’s dilemma."- The Innovator’s Dilemma, page 225


  Solving the Innovator’s Dilemma cannot be done by merely making fewer mistakes
  than others. **Rather we must adopt an active approach and create rather than
  merely iterating.** If we are always focused on improving what we have rather
  than creating something new we will be unlikely to innovate and will fall
  behind regardless of how well we run our business. Successfully navigating
  disruption requires an active step and will not happen by default. Lock step
  improvements on the status quo may sustain us in the short term but are
  woefully ill-equipped to compete tomorrow with new products.


  **Thriving amidst the uncertainty that is disruption is not a question of
  management acumen or having a superior product, but a willingness to take a
  step into the unknown.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Since I spend most of my day in a classroom rather than an office I initially
  struggled with how to apply the ideas from _The Innovator’s Dilemma_. However,
  I eventually decided to apply the book’s principles on a more personal level.
  I am setting aside time to prepare and learn so that I will be read for a
  disruption in my own life. I created a Beta folder on my iPhone with new
  things relevant to my interests and studies that I spend time learning and
  tinkering with. I am trying to take active steps to learn about new ideas and
  opportunities relevant to my field of study to prepare me for tomorrow.

**Why do successful companies fail?** Because they have previously been successful. Seldom is it incompetence or a bad product. Then what causes them to fall from their success? It is this question that Harvard Business Professor Clayton Christensen answers in _The Innovator’s Dilemma_. Paradoxically, Christensen explains that **successful companies often fail because they continue to do what made them successful rather than continuing to innovate.** This problem is what he refers to as the Innovator’s Dilemma.
