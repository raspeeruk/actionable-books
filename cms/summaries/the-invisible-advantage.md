  ### Measure What’s Meaningful


  > "Management guru Peter Drucker once said, ‘What’s measured improves.’ In
  other words, you get what you measure. For many companies, coming up with
  ideas often isn’t the problem. The challenge is turning ideas into something
  real that delivers an impact. This is where metrics can make the difference
  between no ideas, lots of ideas that go nowhere, and real innovation."- The
  Invisible Advantage, page 53


  Metrics give us direction. Leaders set goals and measure progress, often this
  focuses on easily measured metrics like speed, efficiency, accuracy, or
  profits. Innovative behaviors are difficult to quantify, and most companies
  don’t have innovation metrics. What we decide to measure determines what we
  get. If we don’t measure innovation, we won’t get it. We should begin by
  considering the needs of the customer and our organizational goals. Is our
  metrics measuring ways we can better reach these goals in the future? Do we
  quantify how many new ideas we have tried and the results? Is innovation
  measured in all our operations or only in some areas? Pervasive pioneering
  behaviors help us recognize when processes are flawed or have stopped working
  and discover better ways to serve the customers’ needs and meet the company’s
  goals.


  To create an innovative culture we need to promote and measure inventive
  behaviors in leadership, employees, and customers. Establishing these metrics
  is a process unique to each company, there are no standards. Where do we
  begin? Read on to the GEM’s.

  ### Fuel the Innovation Engine: Define the Inputs


  > "Measuring innovation also involves setting specific goals that will help
  fuel the process—the things you do internally to help you hit your targets.
  When you give people targets, they take on responsibility for hitting them.
  And in the process, they produce experiences and success stories that then
  reinforce more experiences. The goal is to jump-start this kind of positive
  feedback loop."- The Invisible Advantage, page 57


  Once we have defined the end goal, we need to give people specific goals to
  reach our larger goals. Every employee should be aware of the importance they
  play in achieving the company’s goals and how they share responsibility for
  innovation. Communicate trust and acceptance of new ideas. Policy and business
  practices should align with words that encourage trust, learning, creativity,
  and innovation. Even when given words of encouragement, people will not share
  and develop innovative ideas in a distrusting, discouraging environment that
  impedes learning and creativity.


  On a leadership level, we should set goals that support innovation by focusing
  on the future instead of on daily operations. Are we measuring how many new
  ideas we incorporate from external sources or considering only internal ideas?
  Are we measuring how many large innovative projects we support or focusing on
  small changes to existing products and services? Are employees trained in the
  innovation process? Do we sponsor workforce innovation experiments, and give
  innovation awards? Measuring these types of goals shifts our mindset from
  maintaining the status quo to stimulating innovation and leads to an
  innovation culture.

  ### Articulate the Endgame: Define the Outputs


  > "Most companies understandably zero in on top line revenue and overall
  profitability when it comes to gauging success. Many also focus on their net
  promoter scores. These high-altitude metrics are indeed important, but they
  have limited value for measuring—and driving—innovation. Why? They’re numbers.
  They don’t take into account what people want. Most important, they don’t
  inspire action toward specific goals."- The Invisible Advantage, page 56


  Measuring profitability and the support of our customers is important, but it
  doesn’t tell us what specific behaviors will lead to more profits and more
  satisfied clients in the future. Our metrics need to define the end goal and
  encourage innovative practices. We need to measure how well we are adapting,
  responding to changing customer needs, and keeping our practices aligned with
  our objectives.


  Innovation metrics that define the end goal may include the number of clients
  who trade up to next generation products or services, the business generated
  in new customer segments, or revenue from new markets. Metrics like these
  define goals, identify opportunities and promote innovation. Specific criteria
  vary between organizations, but they should set the end goal and help
  determine the innovative behaviors leading to positive changes.
f_conclusion: >-
  What we measure is what we get, it helps defines our organization and what
  type of culture we have. To develop appropriate innovation metrics we need to
  be receptive, persistent, and patient. It is an ongoing process of thoughtful
  consideration. Defining this nebulous metric is not easy, but it’s what
  matters most. Measuring innovative behaviors encourages an adaptive company
  culture and aligns goals with the evolving needs of our clients. Measuring
  innovation helps define the actions that make us capable of sustaining a
  competitive advantage.

  "It’s really not that difficult to decipher your innovation culture by looking
  at leadership behavior, organizational structure, business processes, metrics
  and incentives, rewards and recognition, and the stories and symbols that
  reinforce (or inhibit) innovation. By understanding the things that shape
  norms, values, and behavior, it becomes possible to influence them—and to
  create a culture of innovation."

In business, we often aim for disruptive innovation, transformative breakthroughs that decimate competitors and drive uncharted growth. We underrate sustaining innovation that fosters perseverance, improves business, adds value, and is a requisite for disruptive innovation. In _The Invisible Advantage: How to Create a Culture of Innovation_, Soren Kaplan explains how to cultivate a corporate culture of innovation.

A company culture of innovation is the only way to sustain a competitive advantage. The norms, values, and behaviors in business either stifle or support change. Innovation enables a company to reinvent itself and prevents it from becoming obsolete. There is no precise formula, each organization is different, and processes must fit each unique situation. In businesses that promote creativity and learning at all levels, innovation doesn’t feel like a risk and people are comfortable experimenting with new ideas and progressive changes.

Kaplan provides a complete framework and tools to create a culture of innovation. For this summary, I’ll focus on metrics, how what we measure influences our company culture and can stimulate or constrain innovation.
