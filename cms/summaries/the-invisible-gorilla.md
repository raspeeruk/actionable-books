  ### Seeing Often Isn't


  > "When people devote their attention to a particular area or aspect of their
  visual world, they tend not to notice unexpected objects, even when those
  unexpected objects are salient, potentially important, and appear right where
  they are looking."- The Invisible Gorilla, pages 6–7


  Chabris and Simons make it clear, they’re not speaking metaphorically. The
  research shows over and over that **we can look right at something,**
  something meaningful, important, **and simply not see it.**


  Focus, as when counting the passes in the gorilla video, causes blindness to
  portions of the world we’re not focusing on. This is how the brain is
  designed. **Expectations allow us to focus, to set goals,** to go confidently
  in the direction of, if not dreams, at least the next stop.


  “But for the human mind, expectations and goals are inextricably intertwined
  with the most basic processes of perception and are not readily extinguished.
  Expectations are based on our prior experiences of the world, and perception
  builds on that experience.”


  Next time you disagree with someone’s account of a shared experience, ask
  yourself if the differences you think you remember are **more salient than a
  chest-thumping gorilla on a basketball court.** If not, what makes you think
  what either of you saw in the first place or remembers afterward is “the
  truth”?


  That’s the greatest value in recognizing inattentional blindness: how we react
  when presented with evidence that **two perfectly rational intelligent people
  saw the same thing very differently.**


  While it would be great to proactively combat inattentional blindness, there’s
  a reason we can’t: we’d **lose our ability to focus.**

  ### Cause


  > "The three biases underlying the illusion of cause — overzealous pattern
  detection mechanisms, the unjustified leap from correlation to causation, and
  the inherent appeal of chronological narratives."- The Invisible Gorilla, page
  174


  I cannot prove this story is true, but I want it to be true: a caller told the
  help desk at their company that when they hit the spacebar on their computer,
  the phone in the next cubicle rang — _but only sometimes_.


  We are wired for narrative; that is, we’re not just storytellers, we’re story
  listeners. Story is part of our makeup. As a result, when we experience A,
  then B, then C, our brain tells us _A caused B, which resulted in C._


  A graph of ice cream consumption and drowning would show a neat correlation:
  as one goes up or down, the other does the same. You probably realize that ice
  cream doesn’t cause drowning. It’s not a huge leap to the idea that **hot
  weather** leads to more ice cream and more swimming. More swimming,
  unfortunately, leads to more drownings.


  There’s a correlation between ice cream consumption and drowning, but
  certainly **not causation**.


  Sometimes the random chance or third-party causation isn’t so obvious. The
  complete lack of any causative link between immunizations and autism has been
  **documented repeatedly**, but the powerful parental experience of one
  following the other overrides, overwhelms, any logical considerations.


  Just as **our brain’s facial recognition systems** can cause us to see faces
  in the whorls of a tree, a pattern of dots, or the browning on a grilled
  cheese sandwich, our innate ability (and desire) for story, for sequential
  narrative experience, leads us to infer cause and effect where there’s nothing
  more than two unrelated events connected only by the fact that we noted them
  both.


  Without realizing it, we go through life like Homer Simpson, hoping to buy
  Lisa’s rock to keep the tigers away. (Google it.) **Just because we don’t see
  bears does not mean the bear patrol is working.**

  ### Attention is a Zero-Sum Game


  > "For the human brain, attention is essentially a zero–sum game: if we pay
  more attention to one place, object, or event, we necessarily pay less
  attention to others."- The Invisible Gorilla, page 38


  Many of us go through life believing our eyes and ears are recording the world
  around us like a 3D video, to be stored and played back at will later using
  the thing we call memory.


  Physiologically, that’s not how it works. Our eyes are physically capable of
  taking in a certain amount of information, and no more. The connection from
  our eyes to our brain and the perceptive centers in the brain are capable of
  making sense of only a certain amount of information, and **no more.**


  Trying to pay attention to more than we can is exactly like trying to fly by
  flapping your arms: your body **doesn’t work that way.**


  Our ability to focus is vital to life. Without it, **nothing around us would
  make sense.** We see a loved one’s face in a crowd — but not the other 999
  faces. We see the book we’re looking for on the shelf, but not the one on the
  shelf just above which we might also find interesting. The fact that you can
  ever find anything, from a golf ball to the next turn, is due to your ability
  to focus.


  Inattentional blindness **keeps us from seeing the unexpected.** The events we
  miss, from gorillas in a basketball game to drivers coming the wrong way down
  a one-way street, are unexpected because they’re rare. Most of us go through
  life unaware of inattentional blindness simply because we rarely experience
  negative repercussions. When we’re in a fender-bender with the nut going the
  wrong way down the street, **we don’t blame our zero-sum ability to focus,**
  we blame the nut (and, I believe, rightly so.)


  When we don’t notice continuity errors in a movie (Julia Roberts picks up a
  croissant, then she’s suddenly eating a pancake) or our significant others’
  new hair style, **it’s rarely life-threatening**, which is why we’ve all
  managed to stumble through life this far.
f_conclusion: >-
  We survive just fine with our illusions. We’re rarely seriously damaged by
  inattentional blindness, by a faulty memory, by too much trust in the
  confidence of others, or by leaping to conclusions about cause and effect.

> "We experience far less of our visual world than we think we do." _\- The Invisible Gorilla, page 7_

Imagine watching a video of two basketball teams dribbling and passing the ball. You count the passes of the white-shirted team to each other. You’re focused, but certainly not oblivious.

Just in case you haven’t seen this yet, **stop right now and watch** [**this video**](http://www.youtube.com/embed/IGQmdoK_ZfY?feature=player_embedded). Pay attention to the instructions. Then continue reading.

**Watch the video before you continue reading!**

Did you see it? Half — **_half_** — of the people who watch the video don’t see it.

This is not an “illusion” in the sense we’re used to. No tricks, no editing. The illusion is that **we think we experience the world around us fully.**

Truth is, we just might be missing more than we experience, just as you may have missed the gorilla in that video.

Rather than a theoretical manifesto, Chabris and Simons share solid research to alert us to **six places we all think we’re experiencing more of our world than is true:**

1\. **Attention:** how much of our environment we experience  
2\. **Memory:** not only can we forget, we can remember things that never happened  
3\. **Confidence:** greater confidence is linked to less ability, not more  
4\. **Knowledge:** our knowledge of most things is seriously superficial  
5\. **Cause:** we see causation far more often than the evidence warrants  
6\. **Potential:** belief in shortcuts to expand our brain’s abilities

The primary example of the book relates to the invisible gorilla and our ability to **pay attention**. insight #2 will explore how we see cause and effect even when it’s not there.

**What can be hurt are our relationships.** Each of us experiences these 6 illusions (and more) differently, meaning that my memory of last week at work may differ from yours; I may have completely missed our friend driving by, then think you’re crazy for pretending you saw it.

Keep your antennae out in the coming weeks. **See how many times you firmly differ with someone** who in other respects doesn’t _seem_ completely insane.

**Where are your illusions slipping between you and the people around you?**
