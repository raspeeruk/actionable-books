  ### Follow the Numbers


  > "After all, to be successful in any business, you need to develop a feel for
  the numbers. You need to get a sense of the relationship between them, see the
  connections, figure out which ones are especially critical and have to be
  monitored accordingly."- The Knack, page 74


  You’ve probably heard the saying, “The numbers don’t lie.”  

  Well, I’d hazard a bet that it’s a saying Norm believes in whole-heartedly.


  _“Numbers run businesses. They tell you how you can make the most money in the
  least time and with the least effort – which is, or should be, the goal of
  every entrepreneur. What you choose to do with the money after you’ve made it
  is another matter. You can give it all away if you want to. But you first have
  to earn it, and the numbers can tell you how to do that as efficiently as
  possible, provided you understand their language.”_


  So how do you learn their language?  

  The following two Insights explore how to do just that.  

  (And no, it doesn’t involve meeting with your Accountant.)

  ### Track Your Numbers Weekly and Find The Key Numbers


  > "I believe every business has key numbers."- The Knack, page 79


  One of the key advantages of regularly tracking your numbers is the ability to
  identify _key numbers_.


  You begin to see what numbers _really_ drive your business. And as Norm
  discovered with his record storage business in 2003, you can be alerted to
  “potential problems before they become serious, so you can make the right
  decisions in time to prevent further complications.”


  Every Monday morning, Norm reviewed a two-page report on his business. One of
  the key numbers he tracked in that report was the number of boxes they put
  away the week before: a key number he had learned was a reliable indicator of
  overall weekly sales.


  _“If I didn’t have a key number I’d have to add up sales from all the
  different sources to get the total. As a practical matter, that would mean
  waiting until we did our monthly billing. But I didn’t want to wait that long,
  and I knew I wouldn’t have to if I could find a number that rose at the same
  rate as overall sales. After years of searching, I zeroed in on the new-box
  count and was eventually able to devise a formula that allowed me to estimate
  sales within 1 percent or 2 percent of the actual figure.”_


  One particular Monday morning in the spring of 2003, Norm noticed that the
  new-box count had decreased by 70 percent from the previous week, which
  immediately raised Norm’s red flag: “That stopped me dead in my tracks.”


  Up until that point, they had been experiencing steady growth, and were in
  “constant hiring mode”. But based on the sudden, and sharp, weekly decrease,
  Norm put a temporary hold on hiring because he didn’t want to take any chances
  should the decrease be an indication of future events.


  It turned out Norm’s cause for concern was valid. He noticed an overall
  decrease over the next four months, and their annual growth rate had “plunged
  from 55 percent to about 15 percent”.


  So what’s the lesson here?


  1.  Track your numbers daily or weekly. Don’t wait for the “official”
  statements.

  2.  Look for, and identify, key numbers (not just sales, cost of goods sold
  and gross profit) that are at the heart of your business. And watch them like
  a hawk.


  _“Indeed, the best business people I know all have certain key numbers they
  track on a daily or weekly basis. It’s an essential part of running a
  successful enterprise. Key numbers give you the financial information you need
  to take timely action. Business moves too fast to wait for the monthly,
  quarterly, or annual statements from your accountant.”_


  From sharing stories of the entrepreneurs he’s advised, to the courtroom
  lesson in negotiation, each suggestion and mental habit Norm shares in _The
  Knack_, is supported by his countless experiences as a seasoned entrepreneur
  over three decades.


  It’s this _practical_ experience that’s beneficial to any entrepreneur. And
  any entrepreneur would be _wise_ to learn from Norm’s experience.


  _“But you know what they say: A smart person learns from his or her mistakes.
  A wise person learns from other people’s mistakes. I guess that makes me
  smart. I hope that, through this book, I can help you to be wise.”_

  ### Track Your Numbers By Hand. No Computers Allowed.


  > "Here's the best advice I can give to anyone starting a business: from day
  one, keep track of your monthly sales and gross margins by hand! Don't use a
  computer. Write down the numbers, broken out by product category or service
  type by customer, and do the math yourself, using nothing more sophisticated
  than a calculator."- The Knack, page 74


  Yes, in this technologically advanced world, with the Business Intelligence
  and Analytics industry offering businesses innovative tools to gain better
  insight into their businesses; Norm puts it plainly, “With pencil and paper.
  No Computers allowed.”


  Why?


  Writing down your numbers (actual/projected revenue, expenses, gross profit,
  etc.) by hand, at the _very start_ of your business, gives you a feel for your
  business that you wouldn’t get if you relied on a computer to produce these
  numbers for you. You get a chance to really _focus_ on your numbers, instead
  of simply reviewing them; especially key numbers such as gross profit (not
  only sales).


  _“You have to write the numbers out by hand and calculate the percentages
  yourself. If you let a computer do the work, the numbers become abstract. They
  start to blend together. You don’t focus on them. You don’t absorb them. You
  don’t get to know them as well as you must if you’re really going to be in
  control of your business.”_


  This is something Anisa Telwar learned the hard way. She couldn’t understand
  why she was struggling to pay her bills when she had taken her cosmetics
  accessories business, Anisa International, “from zero to $1.5 million in
  sales, ‘…and I have nothing to show for that growth at this time.’”. She was
  aware of her costs, and sales markup, but couldn’t understand why she was
  short of cash.


  After taking Norm’s advice to manually track her monthly sales, costs of goods
  sold, gross profit and gross margin, she had a “revelation”.


  _“The reports were a revelation. Anisa later told me that it was like reality
  hitting her in the face. For the first time, she saw what it took to make
  money in business. Before, she said, she’d been winging it. Afterward, she
  began to understand how she could be in control… She was doing fine with some
  products and customers, but the others were dragging the average \[gross
  margin\] down.”_

To say Norm Brodsky is an experienced entrepreneur would be an understatement.

Over the course of three decades, the Inc. Magazine columnist has started more than eight different companies, including a messenger business which was on the Inc. 500 list of fastest growing private companies three straight years in a row, and a records storage company which he sold for $110 million.

Oh, and of course, as Norm recalls, we can’t forget his “greatest business failure” (and lesson) – taking his messenger business through bankruptcy in 1988.

It’s this wealth of experience that Norm shares in _The Knack_, as he recalls his most important business lessons: from being embarrassed for being unprepared on his first day in court as a rookie lawyer, to a lesson in customer service after a memorable meeting with King Hussein of Jordan in the mid-1990s.

At the heart of Norm’s entrepreneurial success philosophy is not a “step-by-step formula or a specific set of rules”. Rather, it’s a set of mental habits – “a way of thinking that allows someone to deal with many different situations and take advantage of many different opportunities as they arise.”

So what’s the most important habit an entrepreneur should learn? Follow the Numbers.
