  ### The Power of Our Thoughts


  > "The greatest gift we give ourselves is often our willingness to change our
  minds. As you become who you are meant to be, what you are meant to do will
  fall like a path of rose petals before you."- The Law of Divine Compensation,
  pages 4 and 125


  Hardly is Williamson the first writer to suggest that our every thought
  creates our experiences.


  One intriguing difference is that she chose to publish during a time of
  “agreed” widespread economic hardship (2012). Her assertion is not to deny our
  monetary problems. Rather, we’re encouraged to _transcend_ them.


  Indeed, _how_ we think releases infinite possibilities that couldn’t have
  occurred had we believed in their improbability. As a consequence,
  **enlightenment is not a process we work toward; it’s a choice available to us
  in any instant.**

  ### Distinguishing a Job from a Calling


  > "The world can give you a job, and a job can be taken away. But a true
  calling puts you in a career zone that cannot be taken away."- The Law of
  Divine Compensation, page 120


  What a great reframe! A job is an exchange of energy in which you do a
  material task for money. **A calling is what you’d do whether you were paid or
  not. Your calling emerges from your deepest core.** Think Steve Jobs.


  Admittedly, not everyone has the talent of a computer genius, but each of us
  has a call to greatness. Does this mean you never have to “look for a job” as
  the world defines it? Of course you do! But with this new knowledge, your
  process could go more like this:


  1.  **You program your mind** to think creative, insightful and beneficial
  search thoughts. You’re not surrendering responsibility, just your attachment
  to form.

  2.  **You believe the universe is like an orchard** abundant with fruit.
  There’s more than enough to go around.

  3.  **You ask for internal guidance** as to whom to call, what to do, and so
  forth. Call it trusting your intuition, or gut.

  4.  **You realize you can’t know what or where your next job should be.** Open
  your mind and heart so that a higher consciousness can flow through you.

  5.  **Before you go to a job interview**, blast those you meet with love and
  light.

  ### Transforming a Negative Sense of Self


  > "You can’t turn off the light, but you can put your hands in front of your
  eyes and then complain that the room is dark."- The Law of Divine
  Compensation, page 18


  “I am a complete failure. I’m too old to get another job; they’re only hiring
  younger people. The economy won’t be picking up for years. All the jobs are
  taken. The system is rigged. I was screwed by so-and-so. I’ll never get these
  bills paid. I’ll probably lose my house. I give up. It’s no use. It’s too
  late. I blew it.”


  How often do our (lamenting) thoughts deflect – not attract – miracles in a
  similar fashion?


  What if we instead activated the Law of Divine Compensation through a shift in
  thinking? It states, **the universe is programmed to improve all things**. To
  do so, we need to give up our past stories, though.


  A helpful exercise can be to jot down the names of everyone with whom you’ve
  worked. Remember that every relationship is an assignment, in which people are
  drawn together because they represent a maximal and mutual opportunity for
  growth. Whether you liked one another or not is irrelevant. What’s pertinent
  is that you now integrate any lessons you failed to learn previously, so you
  no longer need to repeat them.
f_conclusion: >-
  The book uses the example of Dan as someone who did exactly this. With the
  recession hitting hard, he wasn’t teaching enough students to make a living as
  a piano instructor. A job opened up in an educational institution near his
  home that fit his qualifications. His chances were good. But then he “made up”
  it would be too full of political drama based on street scuttlebutt. Once he
  noticed his self-sabotaging tendencies, he decided instead that the universe
  was presenting him a golden opportunity, even if it didn’t look like what he
  expected.

> "The most important decision we make is whether we believe we live in a friendly or a hostile universe." _\- Albert Einstein, quoted in The Law of Divine Compensation, page 1_

Such is the opening quotation of Marianne Williamson’s _The Law of Divine Compensation: On Work, Money and Miracles_. It perfectly sets the tone and tenor of this internationally acclaimed author’s latest release.

Consistently, we’re challenged to change our thinking away from fear and limitation toward faith and love, in the broadest sense of those terms. Especially when our way isn’t working anymore we’re invited to open our minds to consider something new.

I’ve done the same. The results have often been nothing short of miraculous.

That’s why it’s no stretch to imagine Marianne Williamson being voted by a Newsweek poll as one of the fifty most influential baby boomers. From personal examples to global concerns, she inspires us to make humanitarian values our way-of-being. Such a possibility brings me for the situations of planet Earth to “miraculously” change.
