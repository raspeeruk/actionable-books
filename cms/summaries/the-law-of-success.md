  ### Success is a direct result of many laws working together in harmony


  > "A thousand electric dry batteries, when properly organized and connected
  together with wires, will produce enough power to run a good-sized piece of
  machinery for several hours, but take those same cells singly, disconnected,
  and not one of them would exert enough energy to turn the machinery over
  once."- The Law of Success, page 81


  **If you take a look at the most successful people in your life, it is very
  unlikely that they are successful by accident.** Chances are they are
  successful because they have mastered or have a good grasp on most of the
  characteristics Hill mentions in his book—and they employ them simultaneously.


  By thinking about success like a well-conducted symphony, we begin to
  understand that each of the laws plays its own important part in our journey.
  Like the harmony of many instruments playing at once, it is almost impossible
  to tell where one law ends and another begins.


  Take for example the importance of having _a definite chief aim_, the first of
  Hill’s 15 laws. How does one determine what their definite chief aim will be
  without first using their imagination and having enthusiasm about what the
  future holds? **And is it possible to have a definite chief aim without the
  self-confidence that you can do whatever you put your mind to?**

  ### Surround yourself with people that won’t let you fail


  > "This also, is another common error made by men in all walks of life - that
  of failure to work in unison, in a thorough spirit of co-operation."- The Law
  of Success, page 201


  Despite the fact that most success stories start with one person and their
  determination to accomplish something for themselves or for the greater good,
  at the end of the day, their success generally relies on the help and
  involvement of other people.


  Throughout _The Law of Success_, Hill repeatedly refers to Thomas Edison,
  Henry Ford, and Andrew Carnegie as some of the biggest success stories of his
  time. Despite their differences, the one thing these men all had in common was
  the ability to rally a team of people around them who would help them to
  accomplish their greatest goals.


  If the old adage “you are only as good as the company you keep” is true, then
  it is all the more important to **surround yourself with people who will
  support, motivate, and help you reach your potential.** In such an
  interconnected world it is impossible to be successful alone and if you don’t
  surround yourself with people who are willing and able to help you reach your
  destination, you may miss out on something unique and special – the law of the
  mastermind. But that my friends, is another story, and one that should be left
  to Mr. Hill himself.

  ### Chart your course and live with intention


  > "The man who labours without a definite purpose that is backed up by a
  definite plan for its attainment, resembles the ship that has lost its rudder.
  Hard labour and good intentions are not sufficient to carry a man through to
  success, for how may a man be sure that he has attained success unless he has
  established in his mind some definite object that he wishes?"- The Law of
  Success, page 80


  When looking to determine whether you are successful in your life, it is
  imperative to have a purpose, or what Hill refers to as a definite chief aim.
  The reason living with a purpose or discovering your definite chief aim is so
  important is because without it, it’s nearly impossible to know whether you
  have been successful. **If you don’t know where you are going, how will you
  know when you get there?**


  As Kid President said in a recent viral YouTube video pep talk, “This is life
  people!” It’s time we decide how we are going to live our life, and what we
  are going to live for. **We owe it to ourselves to find our passion and
  purpose and to start living with intention.** Life is too short not to follow
  our dreams!
f_conclusion: >-
  Despite the fact that _The Law of Success_ was first published in 1928, the 15
  laws described are still as relevant as ever, proving that there are some
  universal truths that do not change regardless of how many years pass.

In 2012 the world reached a population of approximately 7.1 billion people. When you consider all of our differences, it seems unlikely that we could find a single characteristic uniting us all, but **the desire of success is an innate human quality shared regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, or any other distinction.**

Despite differences of opinion regarding the definition of success, at the end of the day, everyone wants to be successful. But with everyone measuring success by different standards, it becomes difficult to know how to get there. Just take a look around the business and personal development sections of your local book store or even browse one online. The number of titles can be overwhelming and leave you feeling more confused than ever.

Thankfully, with his book _The Law of Success_, Napoleon Hill offers a comprehensive guide to becoming the best possible version of yourself and to becoming successful on your own terms. Without gimmicks or short cuts, Hill offers common sense laws that anyone, no matter where they are in their journey can and should implement.

Useful whether you read the book cover to cover or spend time jumping between the different laws you think apply the most to your life, the book is broken down into 15 sections with each section dedicated to a specific law.

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Success is a direct result of many laws working together in harmony

How does one determine what their definite chief aim will be without first using their imagination and having enthusiasm about what the future holds? **And is it possible to have a definite chief aim without the self-confidence that you can do whatever you put your mind to?**

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Chart your course and live with intention

As an avid reader of personal and professional development books, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I gained from reading this book. Take it from me: Even if you don’t pick up another book on development in 2013, Napoleon Hill has you more than covered with _The Law of Success_.
