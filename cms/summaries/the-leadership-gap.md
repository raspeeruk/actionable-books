  ### Leaders can be both successful and a failure


  > "Being real is the first step to being great. As humans we will never be
  perfect, but we can be the best version of ourselves. And the way to become
  the best version of ourselves is to recognize our leadership gaps, leverage
  our knowledge in new ways, and stand in our greatness. It’s about learning the
  two sides of who we are—the side that serves us, and the deceptively identical
  side that does a disservice to us."- The Leadership Gap, page 19-20


  This seems like such an oxymoron, but regardless of your own personal
  leadership style (archetype), you can be both a tremendous success and even an
  epic failure. By understanding this you can control your own destiny and that
  of your team or organization by merely recognizing your shortcomings and
  finding the solutions to overcome them.


  She lays out how for every archetype, there is a “shadow” or the antithesis of
  that role that often manifests itself by overuse of your strengths. This
  simple philosophy flies in the face of some modern thought where leaders and
  employees are encouraged to focus only on strengths.


  The archetypes are:


  *   The **Rebel**, who leads with confidence, but can become the **Imposter**
  who is crippled with self-doubt.

  *   The **Explorer**, who leads with intuition, but turns into the
  **Exploiter**, a master of manipulation.

  *   The **Truth Teller**, who values candor and honesty, who becomes a
  **Deceiver**, who creates suspicion through hoarding information.

  *   The **Hero**, who is the courageous leader, turns into the **Bystander**
  and refuses to act.

  *   The **Inventor** who leads with integrity suddenly becomes corrupt and
  selfishly turns into the

  *   The **Navigator**, who is trusted and trusts all, changes to the **Fixer**
  and leads with arrogance.

  *   The **Knight**, who lives for loyalty becomes the **Mercenary** and
  becomes self-serving.

  ### Question everything


  > "If you think your behaviors and your actions don’t matter, then think
  again."- The Leadership Gap, page 201


  When things are going great we need to ask ourselves why and what we can do to
  keep it going… and when things start to turn sour, we need to abandon our
  pride, and ask ourselves what we need to do or change to resolve issues before
  they become magnified.


  Daskal provides questions around how to leverage our strengths and overcome
  our leadership gap, and these become the most important and actionable
  elements of the book. Here are a few for each archetype:


  **Rebels:**


  *   _What do you believe in so strongly that you are willing to fight for it?_

  *   _When do you feel like an imposter?_


  **Explorers:**


  *   _In what ways to do you explore as a leader?_

  *   _In what ways do you use manipulation to get what you want?_

  *   _Do you evaluate decisions and situations based on your gut feelings, or
  after through analysis—or both?_


  **Truth Tellers:**


  *   _In what ways is speaking with candor important to you?_

  *   _What would cause you to speak up?_

  *   _When do you think it’s okay to lie or mislead?_


  **Heroes:**


  *   _In what ways do you face fear despite your struggles?_

  *   _What would you do differently if you had nothing to fear?_

  *   _Do you ever worry that you are a bystander? Why or why not?_


  **Inventors:**


  *   _Why is having a higher standard important to you?_

  *   _What inspires you to be creative?_

  *   _In what ways does recklessness cause problems for you?_


  **Navigators:**


  *   _Who comes to you for counsel, and why?_

  *   _In what ways do you give advice when it has not been asked for?_


  **Knights:**


  *   _Why is being of service to others important to you?_

  *   _Do others consider you to be arrogant or self-serving? Why?_

  ### No one leadership archetype is best


  > "Only when we discover the gaps in our leadership, and confront our
  shortcomings, can we become truly great leaders."- The Leadership Gap, page 22


  When we realize that our greatest strengths can also be our greatest
  weaknesses, often because they are blind spots, we can become better versions
  of ourselves. Through understanding our personalities, we can begin to develop
  a clearer sense of what has lead us to success, and then by analyzing what can
  happen if we overuse that strength, we can see what remains hidden from us—but
  is obvious to those we work with. Regardless of which archetype you identify
  with the most, there are examples of each who are universally recognized as
  leaders.


  **Rebel:** Rosa Parks  

  **Explorer:** Jeff Bezos  

  **Truth Teller:** Winston Churchill  

  **Hero:** Malala Yousafzai  

  **Inventor:** Walt Disney  

  **Navigator:** Sheryl Sandberg  

  **Knight:** Mother Teresa


  The key to success is to understand your strengths, and weaknesses, and to
  leverage the positives and work around your blind spots to maximize your
  leadership potential. Regardless of how you lead, you can be the best version
  of yourself by being honest and authentic and working hard on your skills.
  Leadership is not given, it is earned every day.

  _The Leadership Gap_ is a truly enjoyable book, one that I consumed in a
  single sitting because I wanted to understand more about myself and others
  with whom I interact.

  "This is the mistake that highly driven, overachieving leaders make every day.
  They have soared to the greatest heights on the basis of what they know. But
  there comes a time when they must rethink everything and ask themselves: What
  is the gap between who I am and who I want to be, and do I know what it is I
  still need to learn?"

In _The Leadership Gap_: _What Gets Between You and Your Greatness,_ executive coach and author Lolly Daskal puts her years of consultation and coaching with numerous executives into practical language and the result is a very good read, as the language is accessible and the concepts are universal. This research becomes the basis of the current leadership problem that so many face: What worked in the past does not guarantee success in the future because our world is changing. The way Daskal has written this book allows for anyone to identify themselves and others in the leadership archetypes, and begin to understand the challenges—as well as the gaps—that each present. The main point is that even the most successful leaders can fall victim to their own success and struggle unless they can identify and understand what they need to know: This is what Lolly calls the “leadership gap”.

_The Leadership Gap_ is a truly enjoyable book, one that I consumed in a single sitting because I wanted to understand more about myself and others with whom I interact.

This book is an essential tool in honing your leadership skills, not because it provides answers or short cuts, but rather because it asks questions that force you to dig deeper into yourself, into your strengths and weaknesses, and identify those areas where you can make the most impactful change. Daskal’s hope is that you will not read this book once and put in on your shelf, but review and reassess, during successful times and, more importantly, during times of struggle, so that you can re-evaluate your leadership and resolve potential issues before they become major conflicts.
