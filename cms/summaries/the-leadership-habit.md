  ### Habits Get Results


  > "The language of leaders is not limited to words but instead to the way
  leaders communicate through actions."- The Leadership Habit, page 147


  _The Leadership Habit_ examines ten key competencies for leaders, with each
  section further broken down into three specific skill areas. The key
  competencies are:


  *   Drive for Results

  *   Build the Right Teams

  *   Influence Others

  *   Understand the Business

  *   Execute Vision

  *   Encourage Excellence

  *   Develop Positive Relationships

  *   Develop Customer Focus

  *   Foster Innovation

  *   Model Personal Growth


  What I loved about this book was that the authors don’t try to advocate for an
  over-arching solution or quick fix. They recognize that learning, like
  leadership, is not an event or task that can be completed—rather, it is
  developed through sustained action and practice. You don’t need to radically
  transform the way you approach your work to become a better leader—but you do
  need to make behavior change a habit.


  One example that I loved: in the Encourages Excellence competency, the authors
  urge leaders to purchase personalized notecards, and create a habit or writing
  personal notes to team members that thank them for their hard work, and call
  out specific examples of excellence. You can easily complete this action in
  five minutes per week—but the appreciation your team feels will create lasting
  results.

  ### Leaders Model Good Behavior


  > "Leaders have two responsibilities related to growing themselves: The first
  is to develop self-awareness to recognize necessary personal improvements and
  the importance of continual learning. The second is to demonstrate personal
  growth and effective self-management of time and energy. The demonstration
  component is crucial for building teams committed to growth."- The Leadership
  Habit, page 133


  This principle is deceptively simple: people tend to mirror your own behavior
  back to you. Anyone who has spent time with a young child understands this
  implicitly—kids are sponges who pick up on your actions much more than your
  words. A messy parent asking their kid to clean up after themselves will not
  get far (or will have to nag and yell a great deal to make progress). In
  business, as in life, the Golden Rule applies—treat people the way you want to
  be treated. In the realm of writing, we call this “showing, not telling,” and
  I try to apply this principle to my life as well as my efforts as a writer and
  editor. As an editor, it’s important to me to preserve the authentic voice of
  every writer I work with—yes, I say this often, but I strive each day to live
  up to my own ideals. As a leader, you can say that you have an open door
  policy until you’re blue in the face—but no one will believe you unless you
  take the action to open the door. You can evangelize the value of learning to
  your team—but if you haven’t made your own learning a priority, your team will
  get the hint that you don’t really care about it that much. Effective teams
  are made of individuals who seek out both personal and professional
  development opportunities—great leaders model this behavior, thus signalling
  their priorities to the team.

  ### Accountability is Crucial


  > "The pitfalls that can exist when teams and individuals are not accountable
  for owning projects, or executing steps to completion, can be expressed in a
  comical report about four people named Everybody, Anybody, Somebody, and
  Nobody. There was an important project, and Everybody was sure that Somebody
  would do it. Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it. Somebody got angry
  about that because it was Everybody’s job. Everybody thought that Anybody
  could do it, but Nobody realized that Everybody wouldn’t do it. It ended up
  that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody could have done."-
  The Leadership Habit, page 4


  Accountability is a cornerstone of building trust, and trust is essential for
  creating effective relationships. Whether you are driving for results,
  executing vision, encouraging excellence, or fostering innovation, you need
  trust and accountability on your side.


  As the story above indicates, a lack of clarity around expectations and
  accountability results in things slipping through the cracks. When
  expectations aren’t clear, it’s easy to assume that “someone” will take care
  of it. Effective leaders set clear and transparent expectations, both for
  themselves and for their teams. This is essential for developing trusting
  relationships—when your team knows that they can count on you, they spend less
  time worrying about timelines and logistics, and more time doing great work.


  Accountability also permits team members to manage their own time and
  schedules. If, as a leader, you trust your team members to deliver their
  portion of a project on time, you don’t need to waste your time micro-managing
  or checking in on progress. Your team will feel empowered to manage their own
  workload, and produce better results. One small example of this principle in
  action: I’m sharper for creative projects first thing in the morning, and tend
  to leave emails/logistics/project coordination for the afternoons. My manager
  and my team trust me to deliver on my objectives, so the natural cadence of my
  days doesn’t effect them, and they don’t need to worry about it (pretty
  crucial in Actionable’s [results only, virtual work
  environment](https://actionable.co/thoughts/life-at-actionable/2016/10/results-matter-actionable/)).
  I’ve worked in plenty of places where this kind of freedom was not the
  norm—and I can say with certainty that I’m a much less productive team member
  with someone looking over my shoulder.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Leadership Habit_ is an excellent addition to any leader’s repertoire.
  The underlying principle of the book—that great leaders work at improving
  their habits and actions each and every day—applies whether you’re a seasoned
  executive or team leader, or an individual contributor to a team looking for
  tactics to improve your leadership skills. As always, I think it’s important
  to distinguish between management and leadership—“manager” is part of a job
  description or title, while being an effective “leader” is a mindset that we
  can all adopt. We can all work to get a little bit better each and every day.

  "Leadership habits are formed by consistently doing smart leadership
  behaviors. Applying good ideas transforms behaviors to drive results. Subtle
  differences in the ways leaders act and respond, little differences in the
  ways they behave, can make a big difference in their results."
