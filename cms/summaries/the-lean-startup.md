  ### Validated Learning


  > "...the individual efficiency of these specialists is not the goal in a Lean
  Startup. Instead, we want to force teams to work cross-functionally to achieve
  validated learning."- The Lean Startup, page 271


  One of the main foundations of the Lean Startup methodology is that of the
  “minimum viable product” (or MVP, for short). The goal of an MVP is to build
  just enough of something to quantifiably test a business assumption or
  hypothesis. It’s about shifting our brains from the assumptive to the curious.
  It’s about accepting a bunch of market data (if such a thing is available to
  you), but not **relying on it** as absolute fact. Let’s make this a little
  more concrete, so you understand what I’m talking about.


  Feedback from a client group suggests that they have a problem. You believe
  that you can create a product or service to solve that problem. You believe
  that the client group would be willing to pay to solve their problem, using
  your solution. Maybe you even did a little bit of research that backs up your
  assumptions. Terrific. But, at this point, all your assumptions are simply
  that – assumptions.


  Traditional business logic would say to spend 18 months in development, build
  a complete, and super shiny \[product/service\] then spend millions of dollars
  marketing that new thing to your target market. Go big or go home.


  _Lean Startup_ principles suggest you go the other way. Build the absolute
  smallest version of \[product/service\] you can and get in front of your
  target market group. Watch them use it. Listen to their feedback on it. Then
  improve. Ries calls this process BUILD-MEASURE-LEARN. It’s iterative, it’s
  eternal, and it radically improves your chances of success.

  ### A Science Project with Purpose


  > "It is not the customer, but rather our hypothesis about the customer, that
  pulls work from product development and other functions. Any other work is
  waste."- The Lean Startup, page 201


  Customer feedback is overrated. “Blasphemy!” you say. But I stand by my
  statement. Yes, absolutely, customer feedback is **important**. But the
  opinions of your customers (even your best customers!) should not the
  be-all-end-all of driving product development.


  Think about the quote that opened this GEM, “It is not the customer, but
  rather our _hypothesis about the customer_…”. What does Ries mean by that?


  Let’s say you get a piece of feedback from a customer; they share their
  opinion or suggestion on how you could make it better. Do you dive in and
  immediately create the exact solution they’ve outlined? Hopefully by now you
  know better. A much, much more effective solution is to build a minimum viable
  product (MVP) version of that solution. Think small – as small as possible.
  Then you test it with a small group of users. You watch for **the ways in
  which the customers interact with the new feature.** Is it improving their
  experience? Does it improve their experience enough that it will generate more
  business – either through increased sales or justifying a higher price point?
  Is there another way you could equally improve their experience, but faster
  and/or less expensively so that you could keep the price where it is?


  The point here is that we always need to be developing in the best interest of
  the customer, but not necessarily at the customer’s direction.  

  I could quite literally write a book about this book. While I’m delighted to
  be able to share a few of the key points from _The Lean Startup_ with you in
  this Actionable Summary, there simply isn’t the space to get into some of the
  gems like _Lean Accounting Principles_, _Vanity vs Actionable Metrics, Pivots_
  and a dozen more here, today. And so, I implore you – if you’re involved in
  innovation in any way, please – do yourself a favor and buy this book. Then
  read it. Then buy it for your team members. It may just save your business
  and/or career.

  ### A Healthy Diet


  > "Startups don't starve; they drown."- Shawn Carolan, Venture Capitalist,
  quoted in The Lean Startup, page 209


  The challenge with building something new today is that we can do just about
  anything. “We have the technology! We can build him better, stronger, faster
  than he once was!” (to quote the _Six Million Dollar Man.)_


  Super. But what if people don’t want “stronger”? What if they want a double
  dose of “faster” instead? As people involved in startup activities, we have a
  choice – we can build everything into our initial launch and then try to sort
  through that which worked from that which didn’t. Or, we can start lean, with
  one hypothesis – “Is our client willing to pay for a solution to this
  problem?” – test that hypothesis through a MVP, learn from the experience, and
  then build something simple to test our next hypothesis.


  This quote from Ries sums it up pretty well: **“As you consider building your
  own minimum viable product, let this simple rule suffice: remove any feature,
  process, or effort that does not contribute directly to the learning you
  seek.”**


  And what’s the ultimate learning you’re seeking? Billionaire Entrepreneur,
  Scott Cook, made that abundantly clear in our opening quote: “success is
  learning how to solve a customer’s problem”. Nothing else matters… though
  there is a catch. (Which brings us to insight 2.)

**Without question, _The Lean Startup_ is the most actionable and informative book I have read this year.**

How’s that for a summary starter? Shock and awe tactics aside, I mean it. What Eric Ries has done with _The Lean Startup_ is nothing short of remarkable. In essence, he has created (and proven) a new type of business structure – one that focuses on and rewards enterprises that have innovation at their core.

You might be familiar with a process called “Lean Manufacturing”? Effectively, this is a system that has been adopted by manufacturing facilities the world over, and is designed to reduce waste and inefficiencies on factory floors. What Ries has done is take some of the foundational principles of Lean Manufacturing and applied them to the chaotic and uncertain world of the Startup.

**Stop.** Before you close this summary, thinking to yourself, “I don’t work for a startup”, it’s important to get a firm understanding of how Ries defines the term. In his own words,

**“A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.”**

It’s not about working in a garage. It’s not about working on a tech product. A “startup” (and therefore an organization that can benefit greatly from the teachings of this book) is any endeavor that revolves around people and is working towards an unknown or unproven result. Know anyone who’s working on anything like that?

Let’s take a look at some of the key takeaways from the book.
