  ### Culture Eats Strategy for Lunch!

  destroy his home and the other is to make his home look and feel like
  everybody else’s home"- The Lexus and the Olive Tree, page 293


  Recognizing the inherent tension between old and new, it is critical that we
  strike a balance between progress and the affluence it brings, and culture and
  the identify it defines. Especially so in a world where no one is in charge
  and where progress has empowered and enabled individuals to broadcast their
  vision, amass support and drive change with the simple click of a mouse. While
  progress brings improved access to amenities, helps countries improve medical
  care, cure disease and educate the masses, it is culture that gives life
  structure, meaning and a sense of connectedness. Unrestrained globalization
  has the potential to uproot cultures and environments and destroy the
  necessary underlying fabric of our communities. Individuals and countries and
  governments want progress and the comforts it brings, but the loss of their
  identity is sometimes too high a price to pay.

  It is pure hubris to think we all want the same thing. We may aspire to reap
  the advantages of progress, but we risk a backlash if we do so in the absence
  of any filters. Like Friedman, I support that we take this one very important
  step further. Those lucky few (whether they be individuals, corporations or
  nations) who drive so many of those Lexus should not become complacent or
  arrogant. Sustainable globalization requires continual monitoring, change,
  education, awareness, communication…and humility. In fastening our seat belts
  and downing the last sip of chardonnay before putting our table tray in its
  upright position, we accept that the pace of globalization will continue to
  accelerate. On the one hand, we want to keep up with this pace to ensure we
  are able to purchase next year’s Lexus model, on the other we should be
  carefully tending to our own Olive Tree. This balance is not only important
  for us, but sets an example to others who wish to follow in our footsteps and
  reinforces the importance of using advantages wisely. You may choose to look
  at this as a practical obligation, while Friedman prefers to view this is a
  moral imperative.

  ### The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of its Parts

  rain forest is the same way you save a country’s financial system – by
  treating it not as just an emerging market but as an emerging society. Save

  Friedman coins an interesting verb – **glocalize**. It is the action of
  assimilating aspects of globalization that fit your culture in a way that
  complements the growth instead of burying it beneath a bunch of debris. This
  point really speaks to sustainability. It is just not possible to build
  progress if you demolish the foundation upon which progress is built. To be
  effective at glocalizing, one must become educated and knowledgeable, but not
  in a subject matter expert kind of way. In a manner that is integrated. It
  reminds me a little of MBA programs that now espouse “well rounded” curriculum
  that stretch beyond traditional academic boundaries. It is not only sufficient
  to understand business principles, but it is critical to possess the skills to
  communicate these principles both orally and in writing in an engaging,
  inspiring manner. Let’s take this idea and make it a little more tactical.
  When introducing new technology into a workforce or acquiring an
  underperforming business, evaluate and seek to understand the current
  strengths and advantages. Don’t simply demolish everything that currently
  exists in favor of what appears on the surface to be more progressive. The
  collective “we” become better by taking what is best from the old and marrying
  it with the new to reach new heights that may not have seemed possible.

  While I found the The Big Idea in this book so easily identifiable, limiting
  myself to two GEMS was near impossible. The principles and points in this book
  are so well crafted and interwoven into the stories and concepts that it is
  was often difficult to truly understand where one argument ended and another
  began. Quite honestly, this book took me much longer to read than I expected.
  I was so captured by the content and the implications of the thoughts from a
  patriotic, business and personal perspective, that I found myself rereading
  sections over and over again. While at points I was fascinated with the
  possibilities of what globalization could bring, on the other I was frightened
  by the invasive nature of technology and the amount of power individuals with
  an idea or a grievance could generate and mobilize. My question to you is
  this: As citizens of affluent countries and employees of socially responsible
  businesses, are we doing enough to ensure globalization is sprouting in less
  fortunate parts of our world in a manner that retains the most important
  elements of their olive trees or have we lost sight of a healthy dose of fear
  and wish to take our car keys and lock them away so no one else may use them?

> "Fasten your seat belts and put your seat backs and tray tables into a fixed and upright position." _\- The Lexus and the Olive Tree, page 462_

Thomas Friedman is not only a world renowned author but also a prolific New York Times Foreign Affairs columnist. It is largely from his travels as a columnist that Friedman brings his insightful and vivid experiences to describe the framework of the contemporary world and the tension between old world (culture, language, nationalism) and new world influences (technology and globalized financial markets)…your Lexus or your Olive Tree.

We begin with a broad definition of globalization and its system. It is the “dynamic” integration of markets, nations and technologies that creates a foundation enabling individuals, businesses and nations to reach around the world faster and farther than ever before. At the same time, this constant movement at warp speed allows the world to tap into individuals, corporations and nations faster and farther than ever before. All at a cost that is much less expensive but more invasive than ever seen before.

Friedman is a brilliant and poignant storyteller who uses his life and professional experiences to weave pieces of history, pop culture, sports figures, political references and humorous anecdotes to create a picture of this globalization framework and the intersecting tension points of new and old. The book builds nicely upon itself progressing from one chapter to the next providing a complete picture of the challenge, opportunity and role some should feel compelled to play in maintaining and developing this system. It does adopt a pro American stance, but put in the context of this book, some of the political, social and military actions of the country can been seen in a new light. If you read closely, you can see the foreshadowing of the 9/11 tragedy and view this devastating event as the ultimate result of the eruption of tension between the Lexus and the Olive tree.
