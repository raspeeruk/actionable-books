  ### You’ve Never Been Taught to Tidy


  > "People cannot change their habits without first changing their way of
  thinking."- The Life-Changing Art of Tidying Up, page 15


  Isn’t it so? Most methods advocate a room-by-room or little-by-little
  approach. Contrary to traditional advice, if we tidy a little each day we’ll
  be at it forever. The reason we never seem to finish is that we’re not tidying
  in a short timeframe in one fell swoop. Instead, when we properly simplify and
  organize once, we’re done for good.


  Success is 90% dependent on our mindset. If this aspect is not addressed,
  rebound is inevitable no matter how much is discarded or how cleverly things
  are organized. It turns out 90% of people are a combination of “can’t throw it
  away” and “can’t put it back types”; the other 10% of the population can
  discard but can’t put things away.

  > "In essence, tidying ought to be the act of restoring balance among people,
  their possessions and the house they live in."- The Life-Changing Magic of
  Tidying Up, page 190


  Another issue is that of dispersing storage of a particular item throughout
  the house (e.g., books, clothes). Don’t think “I’ll tidy the bedroom first and
  then move on to the living room.” This approach is fatal. When we tackle one
  place at a time, we can never fully grasp the total volume of similar items
  scattered throughout.


  To demonstrate the steps involved, let’s turn to the example of clothing:


  1.  Search every room of your abode.

  2.  Bring every piece of clothing you find to the same spot. Spread out each
  article on the floor.

  3.  Pick up one piece of clothing at a time and see if it sparks joy. Again,
  those and only those are the ones to keep.

  4.  If you have too many clothes, you can make sub-categories such as tops,
  bottoms, socks, shoes, and more; examine your clothes one category at a time.


  By the way, starting with mementos spells certain failure. Things that bring
  back memories, such as photos, are not the place for beginners to start. The
  best sequence is this: clothes first, then books, papers, miscellaneous items,
  and lastly mementos.


  To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard
  those that have outlived their purpose. To get rid of what you no longer need
  is neither wasteful nor shameful.

  ### Finish Discarding First


  > "Keep only those things that speak to your heart. Then take the plunge and
  discard all the rest."- The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up, page 42


  Kondi therefore asserts: Do not even think of putting your things away until
  you’ve finished the process of discarding. In fact, if you start to think
  midway through, “I wonder if (the object) will fit in this drawer,” you will
  grind your progress to an immediate halt.


  To get us thinking, here are several suggestions:


  *   Visualize your destination. Spend some time imagining what it would feel
  like to live in a clutter-free space.

  *   Your only criterion will ultimately be whether the item sparks joy. If
  yes, keep it. If not, discard it.

  *   Focusing solely on throwing things away can only bring unhappiness. We
  should be choosing what we want to keep, not what we want to get rid of.


  Many people have particular trouble discarding things they could still use
  (functional value), that contain helpful information and those with
  sentimental ties (emotional value). That’s why it’s advisable to start by
  discarding objects that are easier to make decisions about.

Immediately, we experience the truth of Marie Kondo’s claims embedded with her small in size (but large in unconventional wisdom) volume entitled _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing_.

She aptly asks: Despite constant efforts to declutter your home, do papers still “accumulate like snowdrifts and clothes pile up like a tangled mess of noodles”? How many of us can answer an unequivocal yes? I can! That’s because we’ve never really been taught to tidy in the fashion of her customized KonMari Method (a combination of her names).

It’s no wonder this Tokyo “phenomenon” has a three-month client waiting list. The drastic changes in self-perception transform behaviors plus lifestyles. As a result, I’ve eliminated about 30 years of clutter. I feel energized, fulfilled and liberated by getting out from “under” what often felt like mountains of décor, etc. I can breathe! You will, too.

P.S. This highly-useful volume by itself sparks so much joy that it shall occupy a prominent place in subsequent homes!
