  ### Rethinking how we think about change


  > "Rather than trying to manage change in a workplace, you and your
  organization need to move with the change."- The Light and Fast Organisation,
  page 11


  Patrick outlines the globally shifting landscape, identifying that we are
  living and working in a world in which Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and
  Ambiguity (VUCA) are the norm. It is interesting to read about the variety and
  number of global events which indicate the need for us to look at new models
  and approaches in running and structuring our organisations. It is noted that
  existing organisational structures and approaches to change are outdated and
  will not serve to support organisations sustaining themselves for success in
  the 21st century and beyond. Currently, many of us are spending too much time
  trying to control the changing environment with old fashioned methods. Patrick
  highlights the importance of needing to adapt to and change with the external
  changes we are facing. To do this he suggests we need more flexible structures
  and employees who have a ‘who dares wins’ attitude which is developed through
  encouraging all our employees to have greater opportunity of being involved in
  meaningful work. It was interesting to read that employee engagement has flat
  lined at 30% globally and this a threat for organisations seeking to succeed
  in a VUCA world. This is partly due to a lack of trust in organisations
  between employees and their leaders. For me, this was another example of how
  important it is for us to rethink how we think about change and seek to
  empower and encourage everybody to step up and pull together as a team in
  helping their organisations achieve success. For Patrick this is analogous to
  moving from a mountaineering style to alpine style organisations. A key aspect
  to achieving this requires leaders to recognise that their people are critical
  to helping them attain success and it requires increasing the degree to which
  their employees are:


  *   **Engaged** – enjoy what they do

  *   **Inspired** – love their job

  *   **Destined** – born for it

  ### Take time to decide what to do next


  > "We have a bias for action and for getting started on things straight away…
  But that approach will no longer serve us if we want to thrive in the VUCA
  world. We need to go back to the box, get out the instructions and sit down
  and read them… we need to slow down before we can speed up."- The Light and
  Fast Organisation, page 133


  This was another great message in a book full of great takeaways. Sensemaking
  is an important activity to support effective decision making, it also
  requires more attention being paid to our environment rather than relying on
  our intuition or other heuristics (biases) to reach quicker decisions. Patrick
  points out that our biases can mean that we ignore factors and thus our
  decisions could be improved by taking more time to make sense of our
  environment and what is happening in it. For me, the other takeaway was that
  the process of sensemaking requires the ability to collaborate and work with
  others in testing our assumptions based on the facts we have considered. I do
  think it is this that encourages our agility as we are not forming decisions
  in isolation and then feeling unable to change them based on feedback from
  others. Patrick references the work of Daniel Kahneman ([_Thinking Fast and
  Slow_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/thinking-fast-and-slow/))
  who found that our bias is for fast thinking which makes extensive use of our
  intuition and biases, and that the brain is reluctant to use slow thinking as
  it is rational, deliberate and steady. Yet it is slow thinking that is best
  for complex problems and thus critical for adapting to and succeeding in a
  VUCA world.

  ### Embrace experience and working with others


  > "The alpinist is heavily reliant on their own and their partner’s experience
  which have been developed over a lifetime’s commitment to the mountains…the
  alpinist has practiced for 10,000 hours."- The Light and Fast Organisation,
  page 112


  A lot of people I meet and a lot of organisations are talking about the need
  to increase their agility. One of the messages I loved in this book was that
  to be agile one must have developed expertise, that it is this expertise which
  enables us to be agile and consider changing environments differently. Again,
  many talk about the need to be and to build resilience in managing and coping
  with change. Patrick suggests that to become an alpinist it is critical to
  develop anti-fragility. He defines resilience as being robust in the face of
  change and bouncing from it, i.e. not changing or adapting. Anti-fragility is
  defined as changing and improving as a result of the change that is being
  experienced, which is what defines the alpinist approach as opposed to
  traditional approaches to change. An additional requirement to be truly alpine
  is to have the ability to partner, to collaborate with others in striving for
  success. A transformation model is presented which identifies five stages to
  becoming an alpine organization. The stages are:


  1.  **Unaware** – lack of awareness (of self, others, external environment)

  2.  **Reactive** – focus on self

  3.  **Dependent** – recognition that others can help

  4.  **Independent** – self-reliance and responsibility, understand the outside
  world cannot be controlled, it is how the individual chooses to respond

  5.  **Interdependent** – collaborating with others at this level, keep
  checking on themselves, others and the environment
f_conclusion: >-
  The stories and Patrick’s writing style have stayed with me since reading his
  book. He has cleverly interwoven many complex and different approaches to
  create his view of things and developed simple and pragmatic models for
  individuals and organisations to help them in remaining viable into the
  future. This was a hard summary to distil into two Insights and I do believe
  there are many others that other readers would find interesting. For me, I am
  excited to review how we do change, looking at how to enable organisations to
  move through the steps towards becoming an alpine organization, and acting
  with deliberate decision making rather than feeling that making speedy
  decisions is the only option for agility in a VUCA world.

> "Regardless of the forthcoming storm, we have a choice as to how we tackle the climb ahead" _\- The Light and Fast Organisation, page xviii_

With _The Light and Fast Organisation_, Patrick Hollingworth has written a wonderful book using inspiring mountaineering stories outlining how this sport has changed with the advent of alpinists. These stories provide wonderful backdrops and, coupled with Patrick’s use of individual and organisational theories and practice, provide great food for thought for individuals and organisations seeking to transform themselves to ensure their ongoing and future sustainability.
