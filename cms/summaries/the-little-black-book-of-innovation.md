  ### Innovation is attainable


  > "...there is a tremendous innovation energy within every individual and
  every company."- Little Black Book of Innovation, page 9


  The author repeatedly reinforces that you do not need to be intellectually
  superior, genetically predisposed, or a Jedi knight to become more
  innovative–just determined in solving your business challenges by seeking new
  paths. This is the single most important message for anyone involved in
  innovation and growing their business: **build your creative confidence**.


  By providing clarity, unearthing patterns and principles, letting you know in
  advance where the main pitfalls are and offering a detailed roadmap, the
  **book puts you into the right mindset**. While it is clear that innovation is
  hard, by breaking it down and understanding the elements and steps involved,
  the author demonstrates how **“innovation”–as a process–becomes eminently
  “doable”**. Most importantly, he leaves you with a sense of courage. “There is
  nothing here that you cannot do.”


  The book even ends with a challenge that all readers take the Innovator’s
  Pledge: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all have the ability to
  innovate, that they are endowed with certain unalienable capabilities, that
  among these are curiosity, creativity and the pursuit of growth.”

  ### The 28-Day Challenge


  > "Innovation is a process that combines discovering an opportunity,
  blueprinting an idea to seize that opportunity, and implementing that idea to
  achieve results."- Little Black Book of Innovation, page 17


  **Innovation is a process** and can only be learned by doing. The second part
  of the book shows you what innovation actually looks like by challenging the
  reader to walk through a precise roadmap and, in so doing, demonstrate that
  the budding innovator can make it happen.


  The 28-day Challenge is broken down into the **4 main components of the
  innovation process**, then further broken down into daily steps and tips in
  achieving each component:


  **Week 1:** Discovering Opportunities for Innovation  

  **Week 2:** Blueprinting Innovative Ideas  

  **Week 3:** Assessing and Testing Ideas  

  **Week 4:** Moving Forward


  The author outlines through this 4 week challenge that innovation can be
  reinforced in your business life in 7 simple ways:


  1.  Triple your time with customers.

  2.  Routinely ask _Why?_ _Why not?_ and _What if?_

  3.  Run a cheap, easy experiment every day.

  4.  Always look for ways to keep learning without spending money.

  5.  Get to the intersections of ideas and people.

  6.  Call the most iconoclastic person you know and ask to be introduced to the
  most iconoclastic person they know.

  7.  Teach a friend 3 key innovation lessons.

  ### Innovation's Seven Deadly Sins


  > "The seven deadly sins have very clear parallels in the world of innovation,
  serving as a useful and memorable way to highlight an innovator’s most common
  mistakes."- Little Black Book of Innovation, page 71


  The author equates the seven deadly sins to the major pitfalls that stand in
  the way of innovation success. He equates:


  1.  **Pride** to overshooting the innovation target. _Solution: Take an
  external viewpoint to understand client’s perspective._

  2.  **Sloth** to not applying enough sweat to your innovation. _Solution:
  Follow Edison’s formula of 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration._

  3.  **Gluttony** to slowing down innovation with too many resources.
  _Solution: Start with less resources to push your creativity._

  4.  **Lust** to bright shiny object syndrome. _Solution: Keep focused on
  value._

  5.  **Envy** to control and internal sniping that can derail innovation.
  _Solution: Celebrate both core business and growth efforts._

  6.  **Wrath** to punishing the wrong behaviors. _Solution: Reward behavior,
  not outcomes._

  7.  **Greed** to impatience for true growth to materialize. _Solution: Be
  patient for growth and impatient for results._


  While Pride, Sloth, Lust, Greed can trip up all innovators, Envy, Wrath and
  Gluttony are particularly troublesome within large companies. Being mindful of
  these traps (along with the book’s advice on how to avoid each of them) can
  help would-be innovators not to be pulled off course. Being forewarned and
  forearmed goes a long way to meeting your innovation challenge head-on with
  confidence.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Little Black Book of Innovation_ is a **book of elementary principles and
  practical guidance** on how to become more innovative and squeeze the greatest
  commercial value from the effort. It provides a roadmap of how to proceed with
  clarity and purpose. Along the way, the author also does a great job of using
  visual analogies (i.e. Mt Rushmore and the 7 deadly sins) as a technique,
  along with others, to make the book’s lessons more accessible and memorable.

> "Innovation – something different that has impact – is both more important and more accessible than ever before." _\- Little Black Book of Innovation, page 15_

_The Little Black Book of Innovation_ becomes exactly that, **your personal cheat sheets and treasure map** to a very important and valuable commodity everyone is searching for: innovation.

More than a simple primer to a complex topic, the author does an impressive job of distilling a huge body of knowledge on innovation into a relatively slim volume of what is most relevant and essential to know for a budding innovation practitioner. Unlike some other innovation books, this book does not provide a comprehensive treatise or a unifying innovation framework – only solid grounding in key innovation principles, initial steps, and practical pointers in thinking and in action. Just enough to get you started and well on your way.

The first part of the book lays the **foundation for starting “an innovation journey”**. It systematically and succinctly takes the would-be innovator through defining innovation (“something different that has impact”), understanding the imperatives for innovation, being made aware of the different types of innovation (commercial, sustaining, transformational, disruptive), offering 4 major innovation principles for guidance (the Mount Rushmore of Innovation), warning of the 7 major innovation pitfalls to be prepared for (the 7 deadly sins), and outlining a short synopsis of the thinking and major contributions of 12 leading “masters of innovation”.

The book was written as part of Scott Anthony’s quest as an author and Managing Director of Innosight, a leading global innovation consulting firm, to **“make innovation a predictable discipline”** and “make it more accessible”. The Little Black Book of Innovation delivers exactly that, in a step-by-step fashion, and will inspire would-be innovators to keep a well read copy of the book near at hand.
