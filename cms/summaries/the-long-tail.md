  ### There’s a Market for That


  > "That’s the root calculus of The Long Tail: The lower the costs of selling,
  the more you can sell."- The Long Tail, page 88


  Something’s happening in our retail world. Three things, in fact.


  1.  Production costs – from recording CDs to self-publishing books to editing
  professional looking videos at home – are dropping dramatically.

  2.  Incredibly cost effective distribution channels (eBay, Amazon, iTunes,
  etc.) are suddenly available, giving anyone with internet access the ability
  to sell virtually anything.

  3.  Google, Yahoo!, best seller lists and influential blogs are connecting
  buyers and sellers with ease like never before.


  And here’s the result – the “Long Tail”, as Anderson describes it, is much
  longer, much thicker and more lucrative than any of us may have initially
  realized, _and_ it’s getting bigger by the day. From the safety of our offices
  or living rooms, we are safe to explore new niches, or go deeper into a niche
  we may have already found. (Did you know Amazon sells over 1200 flavours of
  jam?) People are tired of buying the same old thing – tired of being lumped
  together with the rest of their “demographic”. Demographic profiling may help
  determine broad trends, but it will never reflect the tastes of the
  individual. There are as many different styles and tastes on this planet as
  there are people. The proof is in the new niche industries being born every
  day. Companies dedicated to selling anything from [**maternity
  t–shirts**](http://www.babyonboardapparel.com/) to [**olive
  oil**](http://www.oliveoilsource-store.com/) are thriving. With two billion
  people online worldwide, there’s a market for just about anything. All those
  markets are hiding under the Long Tail, and all of them are waiting for
  someone to capitalize on them. So long as you follow a couple golden rules…

  ### Whatever You Do, Do It Well


  > "At best, a Long Tail marketing strategy, focused on stimulating word of
  mouth among influential consumers, can just create awareness. If the product
  is no good, no amount of emailing is going to keep it from being savaged or
  ignored."- The Long Tail, page 232


  The short head of the graph above – the hits – will always exist. There will
  forever be products and services that have widespread appeal and therefore
  “head of the curve” sales numbers. What the web is doing, though – and doing
  remarkably effectively – is allowing us to distinguish the truly exceptional
  (and therefore genuinely hit worthy) from the highly marketed, both in the
  short head and the long tail. Through blogs, customer reviews, user feedback
  and a myriad of critics (both amateur and professional), we’re now able to
  “pull back the curtain” and understand if any given product truly is worth the
  hype. “Highly marketable” products are rapidly losing their stranglehold on
  the head of the curve. With virtually limitless variety available, consumers
  are becoming more selective. In other words, they’re holding out for better
  options – options that appeal to them specifically, rather than just accepting
  a bland, mediocre product because it’s the only one available.


  What are you providing to the world? Is it noteworthy? Would you consider your
  contribution (or that of your company) more “quality” or more “hype”? Better
  yet, what would your customer consider you? These days, no amount of PR can
  save you from a lousy product; you’re either providing value, or you’re on
  your way out.

  ### Love in the Tail


  > "…we’re starting to shift from being passive consumers to active producers.
  And we’re doing it for the love of it. (The word ‘amateur’ derives from the
  Latin amator, ‘lover,’ from amare, ‘to love’)"- The Long Tail, page 63


  Passion is everything. (We may have mentioned this in past summaries!) What
  amateur filmmakers don’t have in the way of big name stars or professional
  polish they make up for in raw passion. As human beings, we’re drawn to people
  and companies who love what they do. Their enthusiasm and optimism makes them
  virtually irresistible.


  With a virtually endless number of niche markets waiting to be filled, why on
  earth would you get involved in one you’re not passionate about? Passion can’t
  be manufactured. If you want to compete with the leaders, you truly need to
  love what you do. Love for your work emboldens your spirit. It encourages you
  to experiment, to play. In the past, you could get away with passionless
  product creation or impersonal customer service, simply because your customer
  didn’t have a whole lot of alternatives. Those days are gone. They want the
  variety, and it’s available to them. The important factor to remember is that
  people want ever increasing personalization and uniqueness. If you’re in a
  niche that works, don’t water down your message because you _think_ it might
  attract you a larger audience. Your audience is the people who care as much as
  you do. They’re out there, I promise.
f_conclusion: >-
  Joining the ranks of influential business thinkers like Jim Collins, Seth
  Godin and Malcolm Gladwell, Chris Anderson uses his revolutionary book, _The
  Long Tail_ to remind us, yet again, that we live in an unprecedented time of
  change and opportunity. Change in the way we buy, the way we sell and the way
  we interact throughout the process. It’s true – a lot is changing, and at an
  unbelievable rate. And yet… and yet, the fundamentals remain the same. Create
  something of value; create it with passion, and the world will respond. The
  classics are forever.
