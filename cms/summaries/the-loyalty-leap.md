  ### Compete On Value


  > "If we believe that companies will not be able to continue to use cost
  cutting as their key to profitability, then we are on the cusp of a new era -
  an era in which marketers can reclaim their influence throughout the
  organization."- The Loyalty Leap, page 29


  For those who haven’t read _The Discipline of Market Leaders_, allow me to
  summarize the gist_:_ Authors Treacy and Wiersema propose that you can focus
  on dominating one of three categories in running a successful business –
  Operational Efficiency (eg. Walmart), Innovation (eg. Apple), Customer
  Experience (eg. Zappos). But the book was written in 1997.


  In _The Loyalty Leap_, Bryan Pearson suggests that – particularly for younger
  businesses – Operational Efficiency is no longer a competitive advantage, but
  rather your ticket into the show. When customers can price you against your
  competitors with a couple quick Google searches, you had better be providing
  something of value beyond “We’re cheap”. As Seth Godin hammered home in
  [_Linchpin_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/linchpin/), there will
  always be someone cheaper. You can either race to the bottom on price or carve
  out a healthy niche by focusing on providing something exceptional to your
  customers. And that healthy niche comes from one of the other two categories:
  Innovation or Customer Service.


  But is it really a choice between the two? The tired example of Apple as an
  innovative company is strong in promoting the financial value of innovation.
  But then again, Apple has also done a tremendous job with their “Genius Bar” –
  a customer service centre on steroids.


  Pearson argues (and I agree) that while we all, always, need to be looking for
  ways to improve, it’s really Customer Service that defines highly successful
  companies these days. The subtle shift for me, as a guy who runs an online
  business, was to move my attention from _acquisition_ (finding and adding new
  customers) to _retention and loyalty_ (making exceptionally happy the people
  that are already here). Pearson talks about this as a required shift for
  marketers and, while I agree that this may be a new focus for many marketers,
  this is a required area of focus for **all** business leaders.


  Let’s look at a couple ways to enhance your customer service…

  ### Building Relevance


  > "There are four behavior-based approaches to creating relevance - spatial,
  temporal, individual, and cultural."- The Loyalty Leap, page 11


  In [an interview with Dan
  Pink](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-9-with-dan-pink-pink-inc-world-headquarters/)
  last year, Dan said something that really stuck with me. He said that many
  websites, news sources and sales people are “Content Rich and Context Poor.”
  (Wish I could take credit for coining that expression.) In essence, Dan was
  saying that we are blasted by information every day, but so little of it is
  specific to us, and our needs. I’m not talking about whether an email was
  addressed to you or not, I’m talking about the content itself, and how
  relevant that content is to me – the recipient – at this particular point in
  my day/year/life. In a world overrun by content, we’re filtering for context.


  In _The Loyalty Leap,_ Pearson further explains that context (aka “relevance”)
  can be looked at in four categories:


  **Context Category #1: Spatial** – Quite literally, can I take advantage of
  this **where** I am? (Think geo-targeted text messages when you walk by a
  store.)


  **Context Category #2: Temporal** – Is this message hitting me at the right
  stage of my life? My week? (Send me an ad for a new car when I graduate
  college, not when I’m registering for first year.)


  **Context Category #3: Individual** – Totally targeted to me. I tweet “I just
  found out we’re pregnant!” and you send me an ad for _FIRST TIME DAD: The
  Stuff You Really Need to Know_. Nice. (You know I read, you know I’m expecting
  – targeted.)


  **Context Category #4: Cultural** – Take into account my social group, my
  religion, my upbringing, etc. Be relevant to me based on my values and
  interests. Show me that we’re on the same page.


  In every marketing message you send, it’s important to consider which of the
  “Relevance Categories” you’re covering. As a general rule of thumb? The more
  the merrier. Connect with me in a way that shows me you know who I am… and
  that you’re interested in providing me with real value.

  ### What Kind Of Loyalty Are You Developing?


  > "An exceptional loyalty program is one that moves well beyond the simple act
  of rewarding purchase activity to one where the customer is engaged in an
  explicit relationship, where there are rewards for behaviors that benefit both
  parties."- The Loyalty Leap, page 80


  At several points throughout _The Loyalty Leap_, Pearson reminds us of “Three
  Rs of loyalty”: Rewards, Recognition, and Relevance. A simple points program
  that provides people with rewards for use is a start, but does little to build
  real loyalty. (Real loyalty, by the way, is when a customer comes across a
  cheaper alternative but sticks with you anyway, because of the relationship
  you’ve established; because of the value you provide to their life
  **_beyond_** saving a couple bucks.) People crave recognition for their good
  behavior. Are you giving it to them? Are you going deeper than simple rewards?
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Loyalty Leap_ is the best guidebook I’ve seen to date on developing real,
  lasting customer relationships. Bryan Pearson’s been doing this for 25 years
  and he’s got a lot to share – far more than we could do justice to in two
  pages. I’m looking forward to sitting down with Bryan for an [_Actionable
  Interview_](http://actionablebooks.com/interviews/) later this month, and will
  let you know when it’s live, so you can dive deeper into his insights. In the
  meantime, remember who drives your business… and give them something they care
  about.

> "...abandon the conquest mentality, where acquisition is king." _\- The Loyalty Leap, page 9_

I had the pleasure of hearing Bryan Pearson speak at the Art of Marketing in Toronto last month. As the President and CEO of LoyaltyOne, Bryan oversees no less than five companies including AIRMILES – Canada’s largest loyalty platform, and a global benchmark in effective Loyalty platforms. When I heard he had a new book coming out, I made it a mission to track down an advance copy (yes, he was that good).

Expecting a heady book on user metrics and market segmentation, I was pleasantly surprised in reading Bryan’s freshman book, _The Loyalty Leap_. Yes, the book is rich with data and insights on how to structure a successful loyalty platform. But more than that, the book was extremely _human_. That is to say that, despite AIRMILES’ ten million customers, Bryan’s focus remains squarely on **personal** experience. About making a loyalty platform (and any outreach program for that matter) for the primary and driving purpose of delighting the end user through exceptional value creation.

Pearson references _The Discipline of Market Leaders_ when expounding the need for focus on Customer Experience. The reference resonates, so we’ll explore it in more detail in this summary’s _The Big Idea._
