  ### Luck is Not a Mysterious Force of the Universe But a Characteristic You
  Can Develop


  > "\[T\]his book presents that most elusive of holy grails―a scientifically
  proven way to understand, control, and increase our luck."- The Luck Factor,
  page xiii


  In a fantastic experiment using the UK National Lottery and following rigorous
  scientific process, Wiseman and his team proved to the satisfaction of the
  British government that _in truly random events,_ luck is **truly random.**


  Proven. Scientifically. Luck, as a mysterious force of the universe, bestowing
  blessings and curses on pre-chosen winners and losers **does not exist.**


  Well, h’ray. _What is it, then?_


  One response on the questionnaire used in the lottery experiment intrigued the
  team, leading to a brilliant insight: though “lucky” people didn’t win more
  than others, their **expectation** of winning was more than twice that of
  unlucky people.


  Perhaps, Wiseman thought, how people think affects their luck?


  Now, some of you are thinking, _yeah, obviously._ Bear in mind, this is not
  anecdotal evidence. This is the first serious scientific research into
  something we’ve had no scientific evidence for prior to Wiseman’s work. Some
  of us assumed luck was just our own intelligence and hard work.


  Wiseman set out to prove it, conclusively. After years of research through
  thousands of case studies, he verified **4 principles which are fundamental
  indicators of luck.**

  ### Luck School: Start with a Journal


  > "It was time to encourage people to take the lucky charms out of their
  pockets and put them into their minds."- The Luck Factor, page 167


  If luck is simply a natural consequence of our actions, caused by how we
  think, couldn’t it be **learned?**


  In fact, couldn’t unlucky people learn luck? _Madness,_ you say.


  Taking on this challenge is the glory of Wiseman’s work on luck. In a single
  month, **unlucky participants became lucky,** and lucky participants became
  even luckier. Over 80% said their luck had increased, and by an average of
  40%. Even better, participants showed significant increases in life
  satisfaction in all major areas of life.


  One month of luck school **made people happier.**


  The beautiful thing is that he and his team codified the process and include
  it in the book. You, _yes you, right there,_ whether you’re lucky or unlucky,
  can increase your luck, increase your satisfaction in life, just plain be
  happier, by putting yourself through Luck School. It’s right there in the
  book.


  Consider which of the 4 principles of luck you’re already practicing in your
  life. If it’s not obvious to you right now, keep a journal for a week or so
  with a simple tick mark for each time you act in ways shown to improve luck.
  Then, instead of making the mistake of focusing on what you’re not doing,
  amplify those bright spots and watch how your luck improves. You’ll agree that
  luck, rather than being a mysterious force of the universe, is the natural
  consequences of your actions, driven by what you believe and think.


  If I were one of those golden people who always came out on top, you’d have
  reason to be skeptical about my perspective on this book.


  Does it make the book more interesting if you know that I spent over 40 years
  as an unhappy person with a black cloud overhead? **I was the unluckiest
  person I knew.** I didn’t call it luck, because I wanted to believe it could
  be changed.


  Without access to this book, it took me a decade of hard work to turn my life
  around. It turns out that the lessons I learned from a decade of
  psychotherapy, self-help books and practice, and fundamental life change can
  be summed up in a single book.


  And it turns out, **this is the book.**


  I challenge you: if you have bad luck, read this book and put yourself through
  Wiseman’s Luck School. Even if you have great luck, achieve measurable
  increases in your happiness by following a few simply principles which,
  literally, saved my life.

  ### The Four Principles of Luck


  > "\[O\]ver the next few years I concentrated my research efforts on
  understanding the different ways in which lucky and unlucky people thought and
  behaved."- The Luck Factor, page 26


  Once you accept that luck is a skill, the next step is to get an overview of
  its characteristics. Moving immediately from abstract to concrete, Wiseman
  describes four principles (with 12 sub-principles) which we can observe in our
  own lives and in the people around us. Descriptions of his research and
  anecdotal examples **take the mystery out of luck.**


  Prove to yourself that luck is determined by our actions. As you read these,
  notice that they’re neither ethereal nor mysterious. Consider your own luck,
  or that friend who’s a classic example of luck, good or bad. Doesn’t their
  personality reflect these characteristics—or their lack?


  **Principle One: Maximize Your Chance Opportunities  

  **Lucky people create, notice and act upon the **chance opportunities** in
  their lives. They’re relaxed, open to new things, and maintain contact with a
  broad network of friends and associates.


  **Principle Two: Listen To Your Lucky Hunches  

  **Lucky people not only trust their intuition, those gut hunches, they **work
  to boost their intuition**.


  **Principle Three: Expect Good Fortune  

  **Expectations drive our actions. Lucky people persevere when things are
  tough, so they’re **more likely to succeed**. They create better relationships
  by expecting good from those they interact with.


  **Principle Four: Turn Your Bad Luck Into Good  

  **Bad things happen to lucky people, too. They react by expecting, and working
  toward, a positive outcome. They don’t dwell on the negative, but **find
  something positive** in any situation. They take practical steps to reduce the
  impact of “bad luck” in their lives.


  The book includes a Luck Profile worksheet to help you **see which aspects of
  luck you’re already practicing,** and which could use further development.
  Taking the assessment is a precursor to changing your own luck.

We all know someone whose card is always drawn in the raffle, who gets tickets to the hot show, whose car never breaks down and whose marriage is bliss.

And we know their opposites, too.

Whether superstitious or not, most folks believe that luck is a mysterious force of the universe. Either mostly good things happen to you as you go through life, or mostly bad things happen. That’s true, as far as it goes.

But most of us believe there’s **nothing we can do about it.** And Dr. Richard Wiseman is here to tell you **that’s wrong.**

Luck, it turns out, can be changed. It can be controlled. Luck is _a skill you can learn_ and a tool you can apply in business, in life.
