  ### The Marshmallow Test


  > "The traditional belief that willpower is an inborn trait that you either
  have a lot of or you don’t (but cannot do much about either way) is false."-
  The Marshmallow Test, page 230


  Taking place within the Bing Nursery School at Stanford University, the
  Marshmallow Test was first conducted with the intention of assessing willpower
  and the preschooler’s ability to delay gratification for the sake of future
  reward. With this pretense, children were offered a smaller reward (one
  marshmallow) immediately, or two marshmallows if they waited the designated
  time, both options were visible. The researchers then watched the children as
  they wrestled with the temptation, making observations and finding trends
  related to coping behaviors and strategies applied by each. While at times
  comical in his description of the children’s coping skills, it is clear that
  the variances in self-control, the methods of distraction and their delayed
  gratification are ever present from a young age. Later assessed in adulthood,
  Mischel’s research team found that “those who had delayed longer in preschool
  self-reported that they were able to pursue and reach long term goals, used
  risky drugs less, had reached higher educational levels, and had significantly
  lower body mass index.”


  Whilst it is clear that some individuals are better than others in deploying
  self-control and exercising willpower, Mischel has discovered that it is not a
  set fate. We have the ability to learn, enhance and properly harness willpower
  as a skill and apply it at various stages within our lives, with careful
  assessment and thorough commitment.


  This should come as a relief for those who can agree that human nature is
  malleable and open to change. If you self-identify as lacking this internal
  resistance, seemingly doomed by a fate of overindulgence—there is hope. “We do
  not come into this world with a bundle of fixed, stable traits that determine
  who we become.”

  ### Hot and cold


  > "Self-control involves more than determination; it requires strategies and
  insights, as well as goals and motivation, to make willpower easier to develop
  and persistence rewarding in its own right"- The Marshmallow Test, page 230


  By understanding your natural tendencies and deploying strategies for growth,
  you can shift from being purely temptation and rewards based (hot) to more
  logical and detached (cold) in your decision-making behaviors. This is just
  one of the theories that support personal development as it relates to
  developing and nurturing willpower.


  The hot and cold focus theory is a compelling one, meaning “the effect that a
  stimulus has on us depends on how we represent it mentally. An arousing
  representation focuses on the motivating, hot qualities of the stimulus… A
  cool representation focuses on more of the abstract, cognitive, informational
  aspects of the stimulus and tells you what it’s like without making it more
  tempting.”


  Testing this theory within the Marshmallow Test framework, children were
  encouraged to explore both hot and cold representations of the treat in front
  of them. A hot representation has the marshmallow looking sweet and chewy,
  while the cold representation has it objectively described as round, white and
  soft, and “when cued to focus on the cool features of their rewards, children
  waited twice as long as when prompted to focus on the hot features.”


  As adults, we can all identify our hot and cold responses, but a conscious
  approach to deploying appropriately can have us harnessing willpower in an
  effective and manageable way.

  ### Getting over “Nature vs. Nurture”


  > "We don’t have to be victims of our social and biological histories.
  Self-control skills can protect us against our own vulnerabilities…"- The
  Marshmallow Test, page 230


  Are we born naturally indulgent or instinctually unwavering? Are we bound by
  our genetic limitations, or do our values and personal goals carry weight when
  analyzing our self-control? The answer, according to Mischel, is “yes and no”.
  Mischel is no more tolerant of purely nature as he is purely nurture, adamant
  in his argument that “nature matters just as much as nurture.” The pure Nature
  argument is that our minds are hardwired from birth, fixed with unchanging
  traits that dictate our life’s path, the Nurture argument believes the mind is
  malleable and ever changing as we develop through interactions with our social
  and biological environments. Whereas, when analyzing our tendencies our innate
  willpower is strongly influenced by our genetic disposition with the interplay
  of environmental influences throughout the course of one’s life. Highlighting
  the work of Daniela Kaufer and Darlene Francis in 2011, Mischel writes:
  “Environments can be just as deterministic as we once believed only genes
  could be and…the genome can be as malleable as we once believed only
  environments can be.”


  Through various case studies, including twin studies and socio-economic
  exploration, Mischel was able to demonstrate perseverance of natural
  tendencies where no modifications were encouraged, while also demonstrating
  incredible growth in restraint where environment and social influences alone
  can change the course of fate. Ultimately, if we gave ourselves the freedom to
  accept our natural tendencies, yet challenge ourselves to strive for optimal
  restraint and ideal application of willpower, we could have the best of both
  worlds.

  _The Marshmallow Test_ is a deep dive into the intricate research platforms
  related to willpower and self-control. For most this summary will suffice as
  an actionable and inspiring launching point to take hold of our natural
  tendencies and explore the notion that we have the ability to control our own
  fate. The book also explores further concepts related to the psychology of
  human nature and the effectiveness of research analysis; if this appeals to
  the curious mind, reading further would prove advantageous. Ultimately,
  whether applied to our consumption habits, or various life distractions, the
  average reader can apply these hopeful findings into their personal and
  professional realm and find a successful grasp of their personal kryptonite.

> "If the conditions that facilitate self-control, and those that undermine it, could be identified, perhaps they could be harnessed to teach people who have trouble waiting to be better at it." _\- The Marshmallow Test, page 28_

Harnessing willpower and self-control is a challenge for all humans, but more so for some, than others. Whether we require this skill within our personal realm, such as the need to resist dessert or our professional realm, such as the restraint to avoid social media pulls throughout the workday, Walter Mischel has debunked the concept of willpower in _The Marshmallow Test_ and has devoted years of research and analysis to help his readers better understand the complexities around self- control and the opportunities to develop or strengthen it, and use it to our advantage.

Back in the 1960s, Mischel and his team created The Marshmallow Test, a social experiment conducted on pre-school students that assessed the environment, circumstances, temptations and timing involved in harnessing willpower. Since then he has created longitudinal studies that have assessed these skills throughout the children’s lives and the impact on various facets of their life. The results have created compelling arguments for the importance of willpower and the strategies available to develop, strengthen and nurture this within ourselves.
