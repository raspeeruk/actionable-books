  ### What's passion got to do with it?


  > "Without passion, work is just work, a chore. Without passion, quality, the
  cornerstone of all businesses, is simply about minimum standards."- The Martha
  Rules, page 2


  Martha subscribes to the notion that passion is the key ingredient to a
  successful business venture, so it’s no surprise that the first of Martha’s
  ten rules is indeed passion. Martha Stewart has built her entire multimedia
  empire around her passion for fine living, and her desire to bring the very
  best to her consumers; whether we’re talking about a recipe for the perfect
  chocolate chip cookie, or finding a shade of paint colour that will look as
  good during the morning sun as it does by candlelight during an intimate
  dinner party for six (more on that later).


  In the early 1980s, Martha Stewart was a successful caterer in Westport,
  Connecticut who decided to publish a book; a book that would go on spawn a new
  genre on living graciously. _Martha Stewart Entertaining_ was the beginning of
  her spectacular multimedia empire that would grow to include not only books
  but also magazine publications, TV programs, a newspaper column, a radio show,
  and a line of products from scissors to sofas, all emblazoned with the Martha
  Stewart seal of approval denoting its promise of the finest quality.


  This billion dollar business all began with passion. Without passion, she
  argues, work becomes a chore – like doing laundry; a task few of us complete
  with much relish. Without a focus on passion, your work (whatever it may be)
  will become something that must merely be completed. It won’t ever be realized
  to the full of your potential.

  ### Necessity is the mother of re-invention


  > "You should never accept what is offered to you if you feel it can be
  improved."- The Martha Rules, page 27


  For Martha Stewart, a subpar product shouldn’t be unconsciously gobbled up by
  the consumer: we should perfect it where we see an opportunity to do so. When
  Martha was looking for the right shade of paint, she was “frustrated” to find
  colours that were unappealing and not at all what she wanted. So what did she
  do? Rather than settling for the least offensive shade, she created exactly
  the colours she wanted. She took her cue from nature (for example the pale
  blue and green of her Araucana hens’ eggs) and with that Martha Stewart Paint,
  a palette of harmonious colours, was born. Today my bedroom is painted in one
  of her soft greens.


  Even the design of Bette Nasmith Graham’s Liquid Paper has been improved upon.
  Instead of waiting for the toxically odourous product to dry on a crusty lump
  on our page before we can correct our mistake, we now have Correction Tape,
  which smells great and adheres to the page instantly. There are innumerable
  such examples, but the important thing to note is that there are more waiting
  to be revised to make our daily lives more efficient, or in Martha’s example,
  or aesthetically pleasing.


  Martha’s rocket to fame and fortune is due as much to her desire to _improve
  things_ as it is to _creating things_. Not all of us can create something out
  of thin air, but I do believe it’s possible for all of us to look for ways to
  make improvements.

  ### Write the book you want to read


  > "There were plenty of doubters. There had never been a book like it, some
  publishers complained. (Exactly, I said.)"- The Martha Rules, page 10


  In 1982 Martha Stewart, an unknown caterer from Westport, Connecticut, wrote
  _Entertaining_ and revolutionized the world of cookbooks, becoming the leading
  authority on fine living. To call _Entertaining_ merely a cookbook is
  reductive; it’s a book on the fine art of living with good food as its
  nucleus. Not only did _Entertaining_ give you menus based on the type of party
  you are hosting, but it offered tips on décor and hints to make the occasion
  run as smoothly as possible, something other books had failed to do.


  With _Entertaining_ Martha Stewart wrote the book _she_ wanted to read. To
  Martha Stewart’s mind _Entertaining_ filled a void; it was a book the likes of
  which hadn’t been seen before. That was the point. She was told it wouldn’t
  succeed, but succeed it did. While the book inspired some derision among
  pessimistic critics, the public ate it up, and it has become the most
  successful cookbook (although it wasn’t really a cookbook) after Julia Child
  and Simone Beck’s _Mastering the Art of French Cooking_. _Entertaining_
  actually inspired a new genre of books on the fine art of living, and
  countless copycats have hit the shelves since.


  In Martha Stewart’s case she literally did write the book she wanted to read,
  but this insight is analogous for all entrepreneurs who see an opportunity to
  fill any void. She cites Bette Nesmith Graham as an example. Bette, a
  secretary, invented Liquid Paper after wasting too much time fixing mistakes
  on her electric typewriter. It not only made work for Bette more efficient,
  but became a viable business, all because she filled a void.


  We have a choice when we see a void – we can complain about it, or we can fill
  it.
f_conclusion: >-
  Easily digested, _The Martha Rules_ is the perfect book for novice
  entrepreneurs, or those who need a reminder of why they began their business
  in the first place. One more point before I end this summary: Martha says that
  being successful in business is more than just showing up and completing a
  task. “It requires eyes in the back of one’s head; constant learning;
  curiosity; unflagging energy; good health, or at least a strong constitution
  that will ward of illnesses; and even the strength and desire to put up with
  sleep deprivation and long hours of intense concentration.” (xiii) With
  passion and dedication, success _is_ attainable. In fact, “It’s a good thing.”

> "The advantage of starting a business in an area about which you are passionate is that when you really care about something… you can often serve your customers very well by thinking about what you need and want yourself." _\- The Martha Rules, page 70_

Mention the name Martha Stewart and you’ll get a number of reactions, from idolization on one end of the spectrum to contempt on the other. Stewart, with her unabashed perfectionism, is a polarizing personality. We have seen Martha at her best, from her breathtaking rise as an overnight billionaire when her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1999, to her pitiful fall from grace when she was convicted of insider trading in 2004. However it cannot be denied that Martha’s commitment to educating her many acolytes on the art of fine living, **and** her considerable business acumen, are impressive.

_The Martha Rules: 10 Essentials for Achieving Success As You Start, Build, or Manage a Business_, is a book Martha began working on while serving her sentence at Alderson, the federal prison camp in West Virginia. “There, amidst a thousand or so women, were hundreds of young, middle-aged, and older women who had dreams of starting a business when they were released,” Martha writes. “Many of them came to me to express their passion, their hopes, and their ideas. They were like the myriad people who write to me with their ideas, seeking guidance, advice, and a road map to a successful business.” (xi) These women reminded Martha of the countless fans who would send her letters looking for guidance on how to get a business of their own off the ground. It was for them that Martha penned _The Martha Rules_.
