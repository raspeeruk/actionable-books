  ### Get Caught in The Mesh


  > "With your Mesh lens on, you’ll also start to wonder: What is it I own, or
  my friends own that we value, where the relationship between the value and the
  relative cost is off-kilter? And can we form a community around offering that
  asset?"- The Mesh, page 151


  Mesh businesses are those that harness the power of the internet, use the mass
  amount of data collected to provide customers with unique,
  environmentally-friendly experiences while collaborating with like-minded
  partners to fill gaps other companies have overlooked. This is the “_future of
  business_”, sharing goods, services and information to help people live
  happier lives for the long term future of the earth. Mesh businesses are those
  who have examined everyday situations, found probable pain-points or
  identified where an asset isn’t being used to its full potential, and
  creatively found a way to make it better or increase its efficiency. They’ve
  used the Internet and data collection to customize the product or experience
  and upped the value simply by using and sharing it in a different way. As the
  economy recovers, people lose faith in the “Big Brands” and change their
  thinking about materiality and “keeping up with the Joneses”, creating huge
  opportunities for Mesh businesses to thrive.

  ### Truly the Information Superhighway


  > "What clinched Netflix’s advantage, though, was that it functioned as an
  information business."- The Mesh, page 137


  We’re an information-driven society and we love personalized experiences – a
  virtual perfect storm for the Mesh. Mesh businesses are hosted online, using
  the Internet as the platform to get goods and services to customers when and
  where they want it. The beauty of the Internet is that it’s also an
  information goldmine, allowing Mesh businesses to collect data about buying
  habits, location, preferences, use occasions and shared recommendations, to
  provide exactly the goods and services customers want in the time and manner
  they want them in. Appropriate use of information also allows Mesh businesses
  to react quickly to customer’s changing preferences and to collaborate with
  other Mesh businesses to provide a more personalized experience. Gansky uses
  the example of a mobile app that shows you movie listings for your
  neighborhood cinema and also suggests restaurants you may enjoy before or
  after the show. And based on the movie you choose, the app may suggest similar
  movies you could rent from Netflix once you get home, with a downloadable
  coupon for microwave popcorn from your nearest grocery store. Customized
  suggestions based on the customer’s preferences makes for a truly personalized
  experience, one the customer is likely to tell his friends and family about.

  ### Quality Goods for Sustainable Living


  > "But the primary solution, and the happier path, is simply to produce fewer,
  more thoughtfully designed products and to use them more effectively. Then,
  less will be made – and wasted."- The Mesh, page 76


  A key aspect of companies practicing _Mesh_, is that their products need to be
  sustainable. Materials need to be high quality, long-lasting and
  interchangeable so maintenance becomes as easy as the sharing itself. The
  whole idea behind the _Mesh_ is that sharing means using fewer resources to
  create fewer products because everyone is using those products as efficiently
  as possible. Like in the Zipcar example, those vehicles aren’t going to be
  sitting idle all day, only to be driven for 20 minutes each way to and from an
  office. While one person uses that vehicle for getting to work, someone else
  can be using it during the day for grocery shopping or going to the beach for
  an afternoon. Or the idea of a tool sharing service – if you need a chop saw
  for a home improvement project, you can Google your local tool sharing Web
  site, reserve your chop saw and return it when you’re finished. You’re likely
  going to get a more expensive, higher quality chop saw than you’d purchase
  yourself at a way lesser price and this chop saw will be way less idle than if
  it sat unused in your garage most days. And if that chop saw breaks down,
  needs a new blade, or otherwise fails, the tool sharing company takes care of
  maintenance for you – their experts ensure its fixed properly using the
  highest quality materials for longer lasting use because they’re invested in
  that product. Sustainable products make for a longer lifecycle.

  By the end of Lisa Gansky’s book, I was absolutely sold on _The Mesh_.
  Seriously, imagine the possibilities if businesses took the hassle out of some
  of our biggest purchases, increased the quality of products and materials used
  in manufacturing, and offered us a more environmentally-friendly, higher
  efficiency use of those products…the benefits to our society and our
  environment would be immeasurable. Not only that, our experiences using those
  products would go from ordinary to personalized with the opportunity to
  experience people and places we may not even had known existed. Gansky puts it
  this way, “_Throughout the world, we are reconsidering how we relate to the
  things in our lives and what we want from our businesses and communities. We
  need a way to get the goods and services we actually want and need, but at
  less cost, both personal and environmental_.”

It took me a long time to read Lisa Gansky’s book, _The Mesh._ Not because it isn’t game changing, but because my mind kept jumping to all the ways I wanted to apply her concepts into my life. Pretty sure that’s the definition of an actionable book!

_The Mesh_ talks about sharing and how cooperation and collaboration are the future of business. Gansky was lucky enough to be at the forefront of the development of the internet (she was part of creating GNN, the first commercial Web site) and if she says this business environment we’re in feels exactly like that momentous time, I’m inclined to trust her! She uses the example of Zipcar, a Boston-based company that makes owning a car a thing of the past. Zipcar is a car sharing service, where cars are parked in convenient locations across metropolitan areas and customers reserve, drive and return vehicles on an as-needed basis. Online, you can locate and reliably reserve a car, parked near or close-enough to your location, drive it for a few hours, a day or more, fill it with gas with the credit card in the vehicle and then return it when you’re through. No fuss, no muss – easy! The convenience of a vehicle when you need one without the hassle of maintenance and ownership. This is the very definition of _Mesh_ – giving power to the internet to use physical assets more efficiently and boost an organization’s bottom-line with the “added advantage of lowering pressure on natural resources”.
