  ### The Obstacle to Success


  > "Mindset starts with ambition because our potential is limited by our
  ambition."- The Mindset of Success, page 17


  Truly great leaders always seem to have a different outlook on business,
  relationships, challenges and life in general. They imagine, create and are
  able to act on and execute those visions. How exactly do they do that?


  Author Jo Owen would suggest that at the foundation of this greatness is in
  their ability to think and dream differently than the masses. Owen says if
  you’re able to think and aspire differently, inherently you will act
  differently which puts you in a position to succeed.


  The real obstacle to success lies in our own heads and the sooner we recognize
  that, the quicker we’ll position ourselves to circumvent it. There are always
  opportunities out there to be capitalized on and most people understand that
  fact. The difference between elite, successful people is that when those
  opportunities present themselves, they don’t just ignore them and continue
  moving through life thinking that’s for someone else. They recognize the
  opportunity, envision its potential and then, most importantly, act and
  execute upon it.


  When you aspire to be great, you will constantly be looking for that
  opportunity to show the world your potential and ability but it all starts
  with that initial desire and ambition.

  ### Create the Right Context


  > "Every opportunity is an opportunity to learn and grow"- The Mindset of
  Success, page 39


  Great leaders have this constant desire for growth, regardless of their
  situation. They see every task, job and interaction as an opportunity to
  learn, grow and develop. While that sounds easy enough, the growth mindset is
  requires an unending desire to be great. When looking at our careers, Owen has
  a five question test to help us determine if we are working in the right place
  for developing our skills and aspirations. They are:


  1.  **Am I learning and growing?** You should be gaining the sort of
  experience and skills that you can use and reuse in the future that you want
  to make for yourself.

  2.  **Are there opportunities today and tomorrow?** Are you in the right role
  with a supportive boss now, and can you see other opportunities on your
  journey of growth and development?

  3.  **Do I enjoy what I am doing?** You only excel at what you enjoy. There is
  a reason for this: doing well takes time, effort and commitment.

  4.  **Are there good role models for me?** We learn through experience, both
  our own and others.

  5.  **Can I find the right support?**


  These questions help us to take a step back and objectively evaluate if our
  current opportunity is one that will help propel us to where we want to be
  long term. Having that type of self-awareness does not come easy yet is a
  critical component of becoming a great leader.

  ### Dare to Act


  > "Chasing your dreams takes courage."- The Mindset of Success, page 49


  During Owen’s research for this book, courage was the leadership quality that
  was repeatedly picked by the leadership panel as being vital to success. Think
  about it this way: early on in human history, courage was proven by overcoming
  physical threats (animals, climate, opposing tribes, etc.). In today’s
  business world, that’s not so much the case. Today’s courage comes by taking
  risks that effect the success of the company, the return to its shareholders,
  the livelihood of its employees and ultimately the personal reputation of the
  leader.


  The question then becomes how do we exercise this “courage muscle” to be able
  to take on and handle the pressure and stress that comes along with risk in
  business today? The answer is actually quite simple Owen says. “Deep training
  and lots of practice trumps fear every time”. There’s a great example in the
  book of a fire chief explaining how he trains his new recruits. “First things
  first… A brave fireman soon becomes a dead fireman”. Interesting statement to
  make but what he then explained was that after countless hours of deep
  training and practice, a fire that you or I would consider risky and dangerous
  is quite routine and relatively safe to the firefighters.


  Jo Owen encourages us to learn to take increasing risk and challenge in small
  steps. Doing this over time will equip you with the skill and confidence to
  perform in any situation that you desire.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book is a great reminder that we all have the ability to be extremely
  successful already inside of us. _The Mindset of Success_ provides a practical
  framework to follow to help its readers get out of their own way, become more
  self-aware and capitalize on their natural strengths and talents to be a
  successful person and leader.

In all areas of life you run into certain people who stand out from the rest. They are the ones who create energy, attract followers and make a difference in the lives of all those they interact with. _The Mindset of Success: From Good Management to Great Leadership_ by Jo Owen examines the characteristics of great leadership. After the completion of his fourteen year global research study, Owen suggests that it’s not your skills nor your abilities that will be the difference in being successful, it’s your mindset.

There are seven mindsets that are examined throughout the course of the book. They are: _High Aspirations, Courage, Resilience, Positive Nature, Accountability, Collaborative Mindset,_ and _Growth Mindset._

Throughout the book Jo Owen will explain to you why your mindset is the X-factor that takes individuals from good to being truly great in their roles as leaders.
