  ### The Life S.A.V.E.R.S for Sales People


  > "Everything is difficult before it’s easy. Every new experience is
  uncomfortable before it’s comfortable."- The Miracle Morning for Salespeople,
  page 45


  The The Big Idea for this book is what the author calls “Life S.A.V.E.R.S.”,
  which are the daily practices that the Miracle Morning is comprised of.
  “They’re designed to start your day in a peak physical, mental, emotional, and
  spiritual state so that you are both constantly improving and will ALWAYS
  perform at your best.” Think of the “Life S.A.V.E.R.S.” as the vehicle to help
  you work smarter and more efficiently each day. “Each letter in S.A.V.E.R.S.
  represents one of the best practices of the most successful people on the
  planet.” They are…

  *   **A**ffirmations

  *   **V**isualization

  *   **E**xercise

  *   **R**eading

  *   **S**cribing


  This sounds like a big time commitment, so I was surprised when the authors
  stated that most of these can be done in 5-10 minutes. This has proven to be a
  great framework to follow to start my day on the right foot!

  ### The Miracle Equation: Unwavering Faith + Extraordinary Effort = Miracles


  > "The purpose of a goal isn’t to hit the goal. The real purpose is to develop
  yourself into the type of person who can achieve your goals, regardless of
  whether you hit that particular one or not. It is who you become by giving it
  everything you have until the last moment – regardless of your results – that
  matters most."- The Miracle Morning for Salespeople, page 157


  Having a strong, committed belief in what you are doing can yield powerful
  results. Throughout the book, the authors talk quite a bit about committing to
  your process (whatever that may be) and having full faith that you will get
  the results that you are seeking if you stick to it.


  Hal and Ryan use the following mantra whenever they have a goal that they are
  striving to accomplish: “I will\_\_\_\_\_ (reach my goal, finish this project,
  etc.), no matter what. There is no other option.”


  The two components of this are “unwavering faith”, which is committing to your
  process regardless of your results for a period of time, and giving
  “extraordinary effort” during this period of time. This will produce the
  Miracle Equation: **Unwavering Faith + Extraordinary Effort = Miracles.**


  Give it a try!

  ### Self-Leadership


  > "You must remember, although where you are is a result of who you were,
  where you go depends entirely on who you choose to be from this moment
  forward."- The Miracle Morning for Salespeople, page 51


  This topic of self-leadership hit home for me because it’s hard to do BUT it’s
  something that we have 100% control over. In the book, Hal and Ryan explore
  their five core principles of self-leadership, which are:


  1.  Take 100 Percent Responsibility

  2.  Become Financially Free

  3.  Put Fitness First

  4.  Systemize Your World

  5.  Commit to Your Process


  The two that were most impactful for me are:


  **Take 100 Percent Responsibility**: “…here’s the hard truth: If you’re not
  achieving the life you want right now, it’s all on you.” That may seem harsh
  and it kind of is. As I really reflected on that quote, it really made me feel
  empowered and in control. If I’m able to adopt that mindset in the various
  areas of my life, look out!


  **Commit to Your Process**: “…commit to your process (without being
  emotionally attached to your results).” This one is tough, especially in
  today’s world. We expect quick results and instant gratification.


  Having the ability to lead yourself is the first step in being able to lead a
  team or an organization. These are two great takeaways to start with.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Miracle Morning for Salespeople_ is an easy, informative and thought
  provoking read. It’s a great reminder that you have to take care of your body
  and your mind if you are to be successful in sales or in anything that you do.
  It is full of easy tips to become more effective in the morning and become a
  better sales professional all around. No matter what our job is, we’re all

  might stem from the effort you put in during your mornings!
