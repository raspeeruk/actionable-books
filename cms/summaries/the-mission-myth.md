  ### Leadership Is Always Required


  > "It may be the mission that drives you. But it's the business that drives
  you to success."- The Mission Myth, page 25


  Leadership is a pre-requisite before the 4 M’s can be diagnosed and addressed
  with honesty.


  When ex-corporate refugees strive for the nonprofit sector out of pure
  altruism, there’s a belief that you will leave all the lethargy behind.
  Surprisingly, that same tension of office politics, bureaucracy, and
  inevitable responsibility with resources (money, staff, etc.) can still emerge
  within the confines of a nonprofit. It still takes skill to soothe conflict
  and ultimately transcend pain points into strengths.


  Despite whether you’re a nonprofit or for-profit, it’ll still take a great
  leader and a great team to set milestones and execute the steps to get there;
  manage outcomes and results; own failures and learn from them; acknowledge the
  need for growth; clearly communicate the mission and its values; empower
  staff, clients, and stakeholders; manage money wisely; and balance passion
  with grounded business savvy.


  How an organization endures in these areas is what distinguishes an
  organization that merely _does good_, versus an organization that _does good
  well_. Mission and business leadership shouldn’t be considered separate, or
  sacrificed over the other. They’re not mutually exclusive. In fact, they
  belong together.


  On the flip side, this same advice can resonate for business leaders, too: For
  doing business (or anything) _well_, you must not forget the passion for what
  you do in the first place, and this can be the passion for your craft, your
  industry, or even the love of helping your customers or clients. Have you ever
  witnessed a business that conducts “business as usual?” Where the mission
  statement taped to their office walls seems lifeless and phony?

  ### Forest People vs. Tree People


  > "If you recognize your category and work with others to supplement you, you
  can help each other out. If you blow it off or think you're better, you can
  and will drive each other crazy. It's your choice."- The Mission Myth, page
  124


  How well an organization executes and builds momentum depends on how well
  people work together.


  Deirdre presents her theory between Forest people and Trees people: Those
  whose strength is their focus on the big picture, and those whose strength is
  their focus on the details.


  Forest people quickly see the lay of the land. They create momentum by
  avoiding mundane details. However, they’re prone to skip over the truly
  essential details that are necessary for buy-in and overall success. Trees
  people aren’t strangers to success, but they can embrace the intimate details
  of any project, yet they’re also prone to “analysis paralysis,” losing sight
  of their true goals, and eventually delaying momentum.


  Neither one replaces the other. We all possess the traits of the Forest and
  the Trees as well as the inherent caveats. Both are essential to an
  organization’s success. However, we’re not perfectly balanced between the two
  and we tend to skew to one side. Not all of us have the foresight to clearly
  see both the big picture or the details at the same time.


  Tension can also arise between both forces. Not only can they _act_
  differently, but they can _communicate_ differently, too. Forest people may
  speak broadly about big goals and may encourage others to get on board. Trees
  people pull back to assess the little steps that are feasible. But harmony can
  still be struck between the two. How? Suspend judgment and remain patient.
  Humble leaders must be great communicators while respecting both ways of
  seeing and thinking. Understand your team, and adapt your actions and words.


  It’s not easy to admit our gaps and seek out our other halves. In your
  business, how were you able to supplement yourself? Have you acknowledged
  whether you were a forest person or a trees person? How were you able to
  discern between the two, and bring different talents together in harmony?

  ### Relationships Still Matter


  > "Providing good customer service means you won't just get customers involved
  in your organization one time; it means they'll come back."- The Mission Myth,
  page 116


  Every handshake, phone call, compliment, and thanks, will have an effect on
  our clients and communities.


  Deirdre begins the lesson simply: When people join your organization for the
  first time, it’s most likely because of the mission. But what keeps them
  coming back?


  When you give people sincere thanks, or go the extra mile in nurturing your
  community, they’ll remember it. When you turn a simple misunderstanding into a
  petty battle, they’ll remember that, too.


  This is the timeless lesson on customer service and their experiences with
  you. The relationships we build should never center on a one-time sale or
  transaction.


  Deirdre insists that we teach these lessons to our staff (and even
  volunteers). How well you continue to treat your customers can have a lasting
  effect on your communities. It builds up an image of your organization in
  their minds and influences what they ultimately do for you.


  Go back to your last interaction with a business or even a nonprofit. How did
  you feel? What did they get right that got you coming back? What you believe
  about customer service will reflect in the way you treat them. And they’ll
  remember it. It’ll determine whether they’ll come back, or leave for good.
f_conclusion: >-
  While there’s more beyond management, leadership in this area can determine
  how easily the other M’s follow through. _The Mission Myth_ is a timely
  reminder that no matter what your bottom line may be, how well you balance
  mission and business can mean the difference between _doing good_ and _doing
  good well_. It can mean the difference between failure and long-term success.

How can you tell the difference between a good organization and a great one? The answer is in _The Mission Myth: Building Nonprofit Momentum through Better Business_ by Deirdre Maloney.

What exactly is the Mission Myth? It’s the myth that heart alone will fulfill a nonprofit’s mission. Success is coupled with hard work, determination, leadership, and most of all, what Deirdre calls the 4 M’s: Money, Marketing, Management, and Measurement.

What makes Deirdre’s insight unique is that she’s been through the corporate world too before making her way towards executive director of the Colorado AIDS Project. She has learned from mistakes and synthesized the myriad lessons. She now runs her own company which helps nonprofits run more smoothly through better business.

While written primarily for leaders in the nonprofit sector, one of the biggest revelations she shares is that the assumed rift between nonprofit and for-profit is mostly illusive. When it comes to serving your clients and running a great organization, despite what the bottom line is, there’s still a need to have organizational systems, good communication, and fiscal responsibility, so that operations can run effectively and efficiently. These are the ongoing traits that will empower everyone to thrive and accomplish a lot. Sometimes the greatest lessons shared between great businesses and nonprofits are the way they handle the 4 M’s.
