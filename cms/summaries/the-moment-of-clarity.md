  ### Use your human skills


  > "When you understand what drives the behavior of your consumers, you will
  reach a deeper insight that goes beyond the facts of correctness into the
  experience of truth."- The Moment of Clarity, page 80


  The authors introduced me to a new word, phenomenology, which is the study of
  how people experience life.


  Any phenomenon, whether it be sports, eating, entertainment, weather, or trust
  can be analyzed by experiential aspects, which are different than hard science
  data points. Meaning, we can determine a scientific piece of data like how
  much rain fell in an hour, but the experiential aspect shows how the rain
  storm affected our mood. A piece of fabric could have three colors, but the
  American flag will have a much deeper meaning.


  “Phenomenology will not reveal the essence of something – say, a car or a
  restaurant – but rather will show the essence of our _relationship_ to that
  thing.” Understanding this relationship can help us make meaning from the
  experience. And the only way to truly understand the ‘experiential aspects’ is
  to immerse yourself in the experience and notice every detail, especially ones
  you might normally take for granted or ignore out of habit.


  The main point the authors stress is this, “get out of the office and away
  from the spreadsheets. Don’t start your inquiry with the theoretical. Only
  experience stripped of hypothesis will reveal the rich reality of humanity.”  

  Not only will you gather ‘real data’, but your human intuition will understand
  its meaning in a more sophisticated way than a computer crunching numbers.


  An ‘aha’ moment, or moment of clarity, emerges when you immerse yourself in an
  experience with an open mind.

  ### Develop a sense of care


  > "Care is such a fundamental human condition that it is noticeable in an
  instant – as is its absence!"- The Moment of Clarity, page 166


  The point of all this human behavior study is to make sense of the insights
  and then apply them to your business to solve difficult problems.


  And when you do that effectively, the results will show that someone cares.
  Care means that something matters to you, that something is deeply meaningful,
  and therefore, you put all your heart and soul into it. It’s what the authors
  say is the very thing that makes us human.


  Some might call it attention to detail. Others might say it’s what you’re
  passionate about.


  The authors call it “both a sense of investment and carefulness” and not
  something that you can install in your organization like an app on your phone.
  It is not explicit, like a manual or a recipe because people often can’t
  explain it, they just do it.


  Some ways the authors offer to develop care are:


  *   Become a consumer of your own products and put yourself in your customers’
  shoes.

  *   Spend a couple of days on the floor of the company working in different
  positions.

  *   Meet people across the organization and talk to them about what they do
  when they enjoy work.

  *   Read the magazine, blogs, and books that your customers and colleagues
  read, and attend the events they would attend, so you can sense what is
  driving their behavior.

  ### Have an unknown mind


  > "Humans, like ostriches, tend to avoid dealing with anything that might
  change their core beliefs."- The Moment of Clarity, page 104


  Maybe I’m revealing too much of my ignorance, but I learned another word from
  this book, ethnography – the process of observing, documenting, and then
  analyzing behavior. It is one of the main data collection techniques for the
  human sciences.


  But instead of starting with a hypothesis and proving it through
  experimentation, like in the physical sciences, the authors recommend using
  abductive reasoning. This is when you start with the assumption that you don’t
  know anything – having an unknown mind – so you can make objective
  observations and only then make possible hypotheses. This kind of reasoning
  helps you better generate new ideas. It’s more about looking for answers. And
  they come in a flash or moment of insight.


  But it takes skill to be an ethnographer (which I saw as a [published
  description of Simon Sinek](http://vimeo.com/79899786)) because in order to be
  truly objective in your observations, you have to always be questioning your
  own internal beliefs and biases so that you’re not interpreting the experience
  from your own worldview (even though you always are.)


  I’m going to attempt to be more aware of my own assumptions and try not to
  have preconceived answers when I’m observing behavior or searching for
  insight.
f_conclusion: >-
  I’m fascinated by human behavior and how systems have such an influence on it.
  I plan to work on things that I deeply care about, and find ways to care about
  the things I’ve been asked to work on.

> "Getting people right is the key to taking your business out of a fog." _\- The Moment of Clarity, page 181_

What is business? Is it a numbers game or a people game?

Data analytics is a beautiful thing. We can find out all kinds of trends and see what happens when we make certain decisions. But if we want to get data about the behavior of people, there’s another way to collect and analyze it.

Christian Madsbjerg and Mikkel B. Rasmussen, the authors of _The Moment of Clarity_, say that people are much more complicated than one piece of objective, logical data, and the only way to get the real story is to immerse yourself in the experience of human interaction.

Not only can we gather a much richer palette of information when we interact and notice all that is happening, but our uniquely human skill can make meaning from the flood of input, essentially making sense of it all. ‘Sensemaking’ is what the authors have termed this strategy for meaningful interpretations of data.

This book opened my eyes to new ways of understanding human behavior. And what better arena to study behavior than business? It’s all about people. So why aren’t we involving the human sciences more to solve our business problems? Well, some businesses are, and this book shows you how.

### Develop a sense of care

The point of all this human behavior study is to make sense of the insights and then apply them to your business to solve difficult problems.

And when you do that effectively, the results will show that someone cares. Care means that something matters to you, that something is deeply meaningful, and therefore, you put all your heart and soul into it. It’s what the authors say is the very thing that makes us human.

Some might call it attention to detail. Others might say it’s what you’re passionate about.

*   Read the magazine, blogs, and books that your customers and colleagues read, and attend the events they would attend, so you can sense what is driving their behavior.

I’m fascinated by human behavior and how systems have such an influence on it. I plan to work on things that I deeply care about, and find ways to care about the things I’ve been asked to work on.

_How can you be more of an ethnographer and use phenomenology to solve the problems in your business?_
