  ### The Biggest Lie of the 21st Century


  > "Our… research offers neurological evidence that the brain can not
  effectively do two things at once."- Rene Marois, Ph.D., Department of
  Psychology, Vanderbilt University, as quoted in The Myth of Multitasking, page

  “Multitasking” was created originally as a term to define computer activity.
  When a computer runs multiple programs or functions at once, we call that
  “multitasking”. Even in regards to computers though, this is not 100%
  accurate. A computer, like a human mind, is only capable of performing one
  task at a time. For a computer, the “switching” between tasks happens so fast,
  it appears as though the machine is performing multiple tasks at once. The
  downtime between tasks is virtually non-existent, so the term “multitasking”
  is acceptable for computers. But we’re not computers. And the cost of
  switching tasks for us is noticeable.


  As Crenshaw has pointed out, a much more appropriate term for what humans call
  multitasking is “switchtasking”. As long as our brains are trying to perform
  more than one mental task at a time, we are actually jumping from one task to
  the other. So what’s the big deal? Well, it turns out that switching between
  two tasks slows us down. Sometimes dramatically. Our brains need to
  re-register where we left off, and then produce the next logical step. In some
  cases (paying attention to the news report vs reading the stock ticker) it may
  only take a fraction of a second to reconnect, although enough of those those
  nano-seconds still add up to make a real difference. And, in other cases, it
  can take much longer to refocus (returning to a client proposal after being
  interrupted by a co-worker, for example).


  No matter how “good” you get at multitasking, you will always be operating
  slower than someone who can focus their attention on one task at a time. The
  true skill is in learning to operate effectively in our ADHD world and, in
  fact, to minimize the amount of time we spend multitasking.

  ### Open for Business

  business?"- The Myth of Multitasking, page 58


  How have you conditioned the outside world to expect you to respond? I have a
  client who has her phone on permanent “Do Not Disturb” mode and has her
  voicemail message set up with the following:


  “Hi you’ve reached Kathy. I’m in and out of meetings today, but will be
  checking voicemail at 12pm and 5pm. For emergencies only, you can call my cell
  at: (number). Otherwise, please leave me a message and I will look forward to
  speaking with you then.”


  Simple, courteous, and completely removes that passive switch from her life.
  And the best part – I always hear back from her in a timely fashion. This
  particular client recently went on maternity leave, and I just learned that
  her company has hired three people to replace her. Turns out, this stuff
  really works.


  So, is the world of the Blackberry a bad place to be? Absolutely not. But just
  like any technology, it makes a far better servant than it does master. We
  need to appreciate the freedom and flexibility that such tools provide, yet
  also realize that we do not need to respond every time it buzzes, beeps or
  rings. Every job and set of responsibilities is different. Maybe you don’t
  have the freedom of setting up a phone system like my client. But I would bet
  money on the fact that there is room for improvement in your day. As Crenshaw
  brilliantly illustrates, multitasking is the opposite of efficiency. As soon
  as you acknowledge that and work on improving real efficiency (not just the
  art of being busy), you’ll be amazed at what you can accomplish.

  ### Switch Operator


  > "If you and I don’t set up a schedule and protect our time, we allow
  ourselves to be run over by the traffic of information."- The Myth of
  Multitasking, page 61


  The first step in minimizing your multitasking is to recognize that some
  “switches” are active switches (self initiated) while others are passive
  switches (responses to outside interruptions).


  In his book [_The 4-Hour Work
  Week_](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/the-4-hour-workweek/), Timothy
  Ferris provides countless examples of how to minimize both active and passive
  switches in your life.


  In generalities, reducing the number of active switches in your day is
  something you have control over, and really becomes a matter of will power.
  It’s not always easy. We’ve been raised and trained in a world that encourages
  us to jump from task to task. If you’re honest with yourself though, how often
  do you really need to check your email?


  Commit, for one day, to working on each task for a predetermined period of
  time. Decide, for one day, not to actively jump from project to project. Once
  you’ve made the choice to minimize the active switches, all that remains is
  dealing with the passive switches.

Multitasking has become a completely acceptable and, in fact, enviable skill of the 21st century. As Crenshaw points out in his book _The Myth of Multitasking_ however, multitasking is not only inefficient, it’s also humanly impossible.
