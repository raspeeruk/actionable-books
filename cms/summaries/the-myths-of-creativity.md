  ### YOU are the muse


  > "\[Harvard Business School professor Teresa\] Amabile's assertion is that
  creativity is influenced by four separate components: domain-relevant skills,
  creativity-relevant processes, task motivation, and the surrounding social
  environment….The final influencer, social environment, is the only component
  that exists entirely outside the individual."- _The Myths of Creativity, pages
  6 & 8_


  As a writer and writing coach, I know the greatest enemy of art: the great
  bully **Resistance,** called out prominently in Steven Pressfield’s _The War
  of Art._ Creation is such a visceral act that our unconscious looks endlessly
  for **ways to sabotage us.** Burkus calls us all out by naming 10 myths we
  tell ourselves to excuse inaction. In each case, he shows us that while it’s
  easier to invoke the myth than do the work, **the solution** is to turn that
  around: do the work, and invoke the Muse – _you._

  ### Brainstorming Done Right is One of 8 Stages


  > "When he had processed all of the available research, \[professor R. Keith\]
  Sawyer concluded that as individuals and teams seek to produce creative work,
  their output comes as a result of moving through eight distinct stages."- _The
  Myths of Creativity, page 130-131_


  Brainstorming the way you’ve always seen it done is almost certainly
  brainstorming done wrong. The entire process in many companies is to gather
  folks in a room and toss out ideas. These ideas are either (1) totally
  unfettered and uncriticized, or (2) subject to the whims of the senior person
  in the room, carefully self-edited to avoid embarrassment by deviating from
  the company line. While the latter is obviously a waste of time, the former
  **only has value when done as part of a bigger process – a process which isn’t
  necessarily linear.** Burkus describes Professor Sawyer’s research findings:


  **1\. Find and define the problem.** Creativity often comes when you identify
  a good problem or ask a question in a novel way or formulate a challenge and
  just the right way to lead down a surprising path.


  **2\. Gather relevant knowledge.** Generating and evaluating novel and useful
  ideas require a substantial amount of knowledge about the domain.


  **3\. Gather potentially related information.** Knowledge of the domain is
  vital, but sometimes the best solutions also involve ideas and concepts from
  outside to give them to me.


  **4\. Take time off for incubation.** As discussed in Chapter 2, the
  unconscious mind needs time to process and associate all the information in
  new ways.


  **5\. Generate a large variety of ideas.** After incubation, ideas and
  connections are brought back to the surface so the conscious mind can give
  them proper attention.


  **6\. Combine ideas in unexpected ways.** As discussed in Chapter 4, many
  creative ideas are the result of new combinations of existing ideas or
  inventions.


  **7\. Select the best ideas.** Generating novel ideas is wonderful, but
  effective creators must be able to identify which ones are also useful in
  order to pursue those further.


  **8\. Externalizing the idea.** Creativity is never a complete process; ideas
  develop, transform, and evolve as they interact with the outside world.


  _The Myths of Creativity, page 130-131_


  Sawyer makes it clear that this is not a linear process, but an **iterative
  network of paths.** Note that what we normally consider brainstorming is
  simply one of the 8 stages, and requires good **problem definition,**
  gathering relevant **knowledge** and related **information,** and mental
  **incubation** to have maximum benefit. It must be accompanied by novel idea
  **combination**, sorting, filtering and selection of the **best ideas,** and
  rubbing the idea against the world at large to see how it reacts.

  ### 10 Reasons to Stop Waiting and Start Creating


  > "We don’t need to rely on belief in an outside force to generate great
  ideas. We have everything we need inside ourselves."- _The Myths of
  Creativity, page 5_


  **1\. The Eureka Myth**


  o Myth: If you’re in the right place at the right time, your idea will
  manifest itself when triggered by something outside your control.


  o Reality: Creative people share a similar **creative process** which includes
  preparation, incubation, insight, evaluation, and elaboration. It is not a
  gift, but the result of the right kind of **hard work** combined with a
  wandering mind.


  **2\. The Breed Myth**


  o Myth: Creative types are born that way. You are or you aren’t.


  o Reality: Of our 5 primary personality components (openness,
  conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) only openness
  has a measurable correlation to creativity. Our openness isn’t fixed but can
  be learned or expanded. There’s **no compelling** evidence to support a
  genetic component to creativity.


  **3\. The Originality Myth**


  o Myth: Great ideas are the unique creations of single individuals.


  o Reality: Most great ideas and inventions can be directly **traced to
  previous thinking** and in many cases great ideas occurred simultaneously to
  more than one person (the telephone, calculus, the personal computer.)


  **4\. The Expert Myth**


  o Myth: Those with the deepest knowledge in a domain are most likely to have
  breakthrough ideas.


  o Reality: At a certain level expertise leads to narrowed thinking and can
  decrease creative output. The toughest problems are often solved by people at
  the edge of a domain, those with enough knowledge to contribute but **enough
  ignorance to take innovative paths.**


  **5\. The Incentive Myth**


  o Myth: The output and quality of creativity can be increased with incentives.


  o Reality: Study after study shows that **extrinsic motivation _decreases_
  creativity.**


  **6\. The Lone Creator Myth**


  o Myth: Creativity is a solo performance; innovations come from a single
  person working fervently on the new idea.


  o Reality: Both Thomas **Edison and Michelangelo had large teams** of workers
  supporting them. Edison’s inventions were almost all the result of teamwork.
  Michelangelo’s art (the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, for instance) often
  involved a team rather than being solo efforts. Great ideas often grow from
  the **differing experiences and perspectives of groups.**


  **7\. The Brainstorming Myth**


  o Myth: One great idea will creative innovation, so generating as many ideas
  as possible leads to success.


  o Reality: Brainstorming is part of the creative process, but must be done
  correctly (it rarely is) and o**nly adds value as part of a larger creative
  process.** See Gem #2 below.


  **8\. The Cohesive Myth**


  o Myth: Great ideas come from teams which work in perfect harmony, suspending
  criticism.


  o Reality: **Creative abrasion**, properly managed, can result in as much as a
  25% increase in creative ideas.


  **9\. The Constraints Myth**


  o Myth: Creativity needs total unbounded freedom because constraints dampen
  it.


  o Reality: Research shows that **constraints promote creativity**, whether
  they’re imposed artificially or exist naturally. One example is the 12-tone
  musical scale which resulted in the greatest explosion of musical creativity
  in human history.


  **10\. The Mousetrap Myth**


  o Myth: If you develop a brilliant idea the world will embrace it: the old
  “build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door” axiom.


  o Reality: Most **people have a hard time seeing how the novel can be
  useful.** Innovative ideas are rejected all the time.

_“We must rewrite the myths.”_

_The Myths of Creativity, page 15_

We all know someone (and some of us **are** someone) waiting for the visit of the Muse so we can launch our Great Idea for all the world to see.

The truth is that creativity, innovation, and great ideas are already inside us. When we fall prey to myths which have grown up over millennia, **we fail to act** and our ideas wither and die.

To help us take action to prevent that death, Burkus **dispels 10 common myths** about creativity and innovation:

1\. The Eureka Myth  
2\. The Breed Myth  
3\. The Originality Myth  
4\. The Expert Myth  
5\. The Incentive Myth  
6\. The Lone Creator Myth  
7\. The Brainstorming Myth  
8\. The Cohesive Myth  
9\. The Constraints Myth  
10\. The Mousetrap Myth

In the past year I’ve read 2 dozen business books, including Seth Godin’s The Icarus Deception, Martin Seligman’s Learned Optimism, Dan Pink’s To Sell is Human, and Michael d’Antonio’s surprising A Full Cup. David Burkus has nestled himself right there with those wonderful books by delivering **a single great idea,** well-documented, clearly explained in simple language, with plenty of **actionable items** springing from one simple truth: creativity exists in each of us, if we’ll simply do the work to bring it out.

**You’re holding back from doing something marvelous because of one or more of those myths above.**

Which myth? What is it stopping you from doing? _And how are you going to change that?_

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book
