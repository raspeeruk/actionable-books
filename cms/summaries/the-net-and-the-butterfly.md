  ### Switch from default to breakthrough


  > "Neuroscientists have recently discovered that the secret to breakthroughs
  lies in our ability to switch between these two modes, the focused and the
  meandering."- The Net and The Butterfly, page 26


  We are all born with two brain networks. The Executive Network (EN), or
  Focused Mode, engages only when we need to be on-task. The Default Network
  (DN), or Meandering Mode, is the source of innovation, runs 24/7 and uses
  twenty times the body energy as the EN. Learning to switch modes is a core
  skill of a breakthrough thinker.


  Dr. Marcus Raichle discovered the existence of the DN in 1997 and he found
  that it never shuts off, it only quiets down. The moment we move off task, we
  default to this network. Raichle declared that unconscious processing “is
  truly most of what we really do; because if we didn’t we’d be pretty
  hopeless.”


  Many of our current business practices insist we keep our EN on most of the
  day. Yet, breakthroughs will only increase as we allow for more mode switching
  during the business day. “Science researchers in the field of creativity now
  recommend the regular inclusion of ‘mindless’ work, something low in both
  cognition need and performance pressure.”


  Adam Cheyer, the creator of Apple’s Siri, relies on mode switching much like
  Thomas Edison did. “I sleep on the issues I’m wrestling with.” He discovered
  the hyperdrive of gathering his “genius council”, the place in his mind that
  collects ideas and analyzes them for potential. He wakes up with new insights
  from his DN and uses them to integrate into his work using his EN that day.


  Cheyer is talking about using the power of the hypnagogic and hypnopompic
  states, the half-asleep periods just before falling asleep and just before
  waking. These are times when our genius council gathers often. You can move
  into the hypnopompic state more by:


  1.  Watching a video on something new to trip your visual center and build
  associations.

  2.  Looking through mementos to access old, forgotten memories.

  3.  Reading a book from your adolescence.

  4.  Taking a walk outside.

  5.  Choosing a progressive alarm to wake slowly.


  As we rise out of the hypnopompic state, it’s vital to capture the
  breakthroughs before we move into the EN mode. The EN will use its on-task
  processes to move a breakthrough forward.

  ### Practice makes discomfort perfect


  > "Doubt is a signpost on the road to something new, a natural part of the
  journey to a breakthrough. If no one had doubts, they’d all have done it
  already!"- The Net and The Butterfly, page 157


  Fear is an essential step on the path to a breakthrough. When fear is
  triggered, our body and mind work to protect us by triggering us into “fight
  or flight” mode. The authors name the Spiders of Fear:


  *   **Imposter Syndrome:** Self-image of incompetence. 70% of people have had
  this feeling. Prevalent among top performers. Blocks breakthroughs due to lack
  of confidence.

  *   **The Inner Critic:** The sharp voice of self-criticism that uses
  “shoulds” often. Reduces breakthroughs by introducing negative bias before
  connections can be explored.

  *   **The Perfectionist:** Strong focus on what is wrong rather than what is
  right. Doesn’t accept the reality of capacity limits. Hinders breakthroughs
  with right/wrong thinking.

  *   **The Maximizer:** Tied to perfectionism, a desire, drive and compulsion
  to make the best decision or most out of a situation. Limits breakthroughs by
  narrowing focus and limiting connections.


  A breakthrough happens when we move through the fear, not around it. To plow
  through it:


  1.  **Define your goal:** what new self-image do you want?

  2.  **Gather past evidence:** Find at least five examples of your creativity.

  3.  **Display the evidence:** Show yourself proof when you were doing what you
  want to do.

  4.  **Embrace your new self-image:** Behave how you want to be and a new you
  will follow.


  We evolved by using fear as a catalyst to do something. Using these insights,
  we can breakthrough our fears more often and take action to better our daily
  life.

  ### Grow your very own organic plastic


  > "The ability of the brain to change itself to compensate for deficiencies to
  change what parts of itself are used for, is just the start of what we now
  call neuroplasticity. In fact, our brains remain ‘plastic’, changeable, our
  entire lives."- The Net and The Butterfly, page 70


  We used to believe that we stopped developing at a young age. Technology
  advances in neuroscience research have shown us that the human brain is in a
  constant state of restructuring, a process called neuroplasticity. Leading
  innovators are seeing that the higher percentage of “plastic” on a team, the
  more breakthrough success they experience.


  Every breakthrough is a combination of ideas. We get unstuck when we create
  more connections. The brain trust at Autodesk created a breakthrough technique
  called the Seven Essential Innovation Questions, or SEIQ:


  1.  How could I look at this differently?

  2.  How could I use this in a way it was not intended for?

  3.  What if I moved this into a new context?

  4.  What if I connected this to something completely new and different?

  5.  What if I altered a piece of it?

  6.  What if I made something new based on this?

  7.  How else could I imagine using this?


  The authors list walking as a powerhouse tool for breakthroughs Move your body
  while you are learning and you will turbocharge your brain’s plasticity by
  increasing the size of the neural circuit which creates connections. All of
  these things add up to an increased chance of breakthroughs.

Most of us believe that breakthroughs are reserved for a few with top-shelf talents. In _The Net and The Butterfly_, Olivia Fox Cabane and Judah Pollack make a strong case that all humans are capable of breakthrough thinking.

They compare breakthroughs to “butterflies” because of their beautiful and elusive nature. We hold the “net” when we switch from focusing to meandering, and back again. The “net”, or mechanisms we use to capture ideas, is the way in which we wander to them, grab them and finally evaluate the breakthrough ideas for feasibility or release.

The authors pack mountains of concepts about brain mechanics into this guide. They also give us an abundant toolbox to create more breakthrough thinking in our daily lives.
