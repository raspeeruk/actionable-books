  ### Begin with the End in Mind


  > "Once we understand exactly what we need to do to win the game, we can
  design each role to contribute to how we win."- The New Game Changers, page 65


  Ok, I admit I chose the second of Dr. Stephen Covey’s [_The 7 Habits of Highly
  Effective
  People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1/)
  for the title of my golden egg. It perfectly captured the essence of what my
  big take-away was, so why reinvent the wheel?! Aimee initially thought revenue
  was the outcome she expected her sales team to produce. However, after
  speaking with her brother Shafe, she realized that strong, trusting
  relationships with customers was actually what generated sustainable revenue
  for the company (through repeat business) and thus was a more relevant metric
  for her sales team.


  With a clear outcome to focus on, you can then outline what role each member
  of your team needs to play to ensure you achieve success. Again, you need to
  go beyond general descriptions to create clarity about the specific actions
  that must occur to create those desired results. We’ll explore this in more
  depth in Gem #1. When you don’t begin with the end result in mind, you can end
  up deploying valuable resources on the wrong activities. This sets people up
  for failure in spite of their best efforts. And that is a recipe for disaster.


  What about you? Are you crystal clear about what it is you want your staff to
  accomplish? Or have you settled for something that seems like the right
  outcome (winning the game) without really describing what specifically you
  need to do to produce that outcome (maximize time of possession and create
  opportunities to score points)?

  ### Maximize Training by Focusing on What Matters


  > "Using the outcomes uncovered from top performers as the basis for a robust
  development system is both powerful and efficient – powerful because it
  focuses development on things that matter and efficient because it eliminates
  wasted effort on things that don’t matter."- The New Game Changers, page 141


  Too often, companies rely on external training programs to boost the knowledge
  and expertise of their staff, only to find that performance gains are small
  and temporary. The authors posit that this is because external training is
  often general and not customized to address the specific challenges staff face
  when doing their jobs. Offering pre-packaged programs places the
  responsibility for knowledge translation and skills application onto
  individual staff members, who may or may not follow-through once they leave
  the classroom.


  Designing a training program based on the specific outcomes associated with a
  discrete job role is a better way to achieve significant and lasting behaviour
  changes. This is because the course content will focus exclusively on the
  knowledge and skills needed to execute the actual job requirements within the
  context that the learner finds him/herself in on a daily basis. _The most
  successful programs are those that combine different modalities for learning_
  and incorporate an ongoing ‘on-the-job’ coaching component that can identify
  and respond to an employee’s specific performance gaps.

  ### Do What the Pros Do

  work, we can teach those in the middle how to emulate that top performance.
  The key is focusing on the outcomes that these top performers aim for."- The
  New Game Changers, page 88


  As Aimee reflected on what needed to happen to turn slumping sales around, she
  frequently found herself wishing she could ‘clone’ her top performers. If only
  the entire team could establish the deep (and profitable) relationships with
  customers that reps like Joe seemed to cultivate so easily, Calara would not
  be facing this current crisis.


  Actually, the idea is not as far-fetched as it sounds. Tapping into the
  knowledge and expertise of your organization’s top performers will yield a
  wealth of information that can then be used to improve the performance of all
  staff in similar positions.


  Aimee met with her top performers to identify how they approached different
  stages of the sales process and isolated the metrics they used to monitor
  their effectiveness. The authors also suggest observing top performers in
  action and reviewing key performance metrics can also be informative,
  particularly if you can compare the outputs of top producers with those of
  average and under-performers. Once you know what your star employees are
  focusing on to guide their decisions and actions you can develop a training
  and mentoring program to teach other staff how to adopt those practices.

  Aimee and her star performers took the time to figure out the relevant
  outcomes, key tasks and excellence criteria that produced exceptional sales
  results on a consistent basis. They piloted the process with a promising new
  hire and discovered an outcomes focus was effective in accelerating job
  performance. The TOPS model shifted the way they approached sales training and
  customer service. You could say it was ‘game-changing’.

_The New Game Changers_ by Greg Long and Butler Newman uses a business fable format to illustrate how the implementation of outcomes thinking can transform employee performance as well as organizational practices like recruitment, job design, and training. Director Aimee Martin has returned to work at Calara Enterprises after being a stay-at-home mom for three years. She needs to boost her sales team’s performance to stave off the permanent dismantling of the division in favour of a slick digital marketing strategy. Luckily for Aimee she has some superstars on her sales team, and a brother who coaches for Navy, who helps her develop a winning game plan that ultimately saves the day.

Long and Butler are quick to acknowledge that while outcomes thinking is a simple and straightforward approach to enhancing performance, putting it into practice in the workplace can be challenging. In true Actionable style, they include a detailed appendix that summarizes the TOPS model, along with handy checklists to guide your thinking as you work through each phase of the model. Briefly, the acronym TOPS identifies the four steps in the framework:

1.  Identify **T**op performers
2.  Uncover the **O**utcomes they focus on
3.  Equip **P**eople to produce those outcomes, and
4.  Coach for **S**uccess.

The key to leveraging outcomes thinking lies in challenging yourself to go beyond superficial, easy answers so you uncover the absolutely vital outcomes for specific staff roles. Let’s explore this more thoroughly.

Integrating outcomes thinking into your organization can be a game-changer for you too. It will take time, a high degree of focus and continuous practice. Like winning teams, high performance organizations:

*   know what it takes to win each game (end result)
*   develop a game plan to overcome obstacles (key outcomes and tasks)
*   teach their personnel exactly what to do to excel in their specific roles (train, practice)
*   monitor performance metrics, adjusting tactics as needed (coach)

Are you willing to do what it takes to be TOPS in your industry? How might outcomes thinking change the way you do business?
