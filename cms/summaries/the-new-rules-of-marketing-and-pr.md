  ### Reach Your Buyers Directly


  > "There’s no doubt that getting the word out about an idea, a product, or a
  service is much simpler when you can rely on social media sites like blogs,
  Facebook, and Twitter. The web allows any organization to reach buyers
  directly."- The New Rules of Marketing and PR, page 26


  Citing a variety of examples, including a non-profit organization in Laguna
  Beach to the real estate behemoth Century 21, Scott lays out a plan for
  organizations who are looking to promote themselves. The first element is to
  demonstrate your expertise to your buyers. **By increasing your online
  presence, you increase your access to customers when they are looking to
  buy.** Most consumers are using the Internet to help make purchase decisions.


  Having an online presence built around your area of expertise enables
  customers to see your abilities at a time when they are most likely to make a
  purchase decision, but the trick is to develop the type of “information your
  buyers want to consume”.

  ### Become a Thought Leader with Content


  > "Organizations that use online content well have a clearly defined goal—to
  sell products, generate leads, secure contributions, or get people to join—and
  deploy a content strategy that directly contributes to reaching that goal."-
  The New Rules of Marketing and PR, page 169


  **We’ve all heard the phrase that content is king, but, for many of us,
  developing content (or even defining it) remains a troublesome proposition.**
  Scott spends ample time in _The New Rules_ defining the various different
  types of content and showing good and bad examples of each type. The range of
  content formats covered in this book range from (but are not limited to)
  e-books, blogs, white papers, newsletters, webinars, research reports, and
  wikis.


  Scott acknowledges that not everyone likes to write. Rather than force
  yourself to do something you don’t enjoy (how long will that last?), you can
  create content with webcasts, YouTube videos, or podcasts. The key is to
  create engaging content that appeals to one (or more) of your buyer personas.
  Again, **the key to creating engaging and valuable content (the type of
  content that brings buyers to your site) is to focus on their problems and
  provide solutions.**


  In the last 10 years, the world of marketing has shifted. Customers are now
  equals with large corporations, and a business owner of any size cannot afford
  to ignore _The New Rules of Marketing and PR_.

  ### Be Buyer Focused


  > "Once you understand the audience very well, then (and only then) you should
  set out to satisfy their informational needs by focusing on your buyers’
  problems and creating and delivering content accordingly."- The New Rules of
  Marketing and PR, page 30


  Successful online marketing is buyer focused, not product focused. The normal
  person will only watch a product-focused promotional video for 20-30 seconds,
  but an online video that helps the customer solve a problem will garner much
  longer viewing times. Home Depot, for example, does a great job of providing
  valuable videos for home improvement novices (like me!). Their videos have
  saved me money by teaching me how to change the locks on my new home and fix
  the flow valve on my toilet. By being buyer-focused, not product-focused, Home
  Depot has earned the top spot in my mind for my home improvement needs.


  **The best way to remain buyer-focused is to develop a series of buyer
  personas (thumbnail sketches of your customers).** They buyer persona begins
  by understanding what the buyer wants from your company and then moving to
  include the media they use, keywords they search for related to your business,
  how to reach them, what appeals to them, etc. Hubspot, who frequently works
  with Scott, has an online template for buyer personas
  [here](http://www.hubspot.com/free-template-creating-buyer-personas/).

> "Learn to ignore the old rules." _\- The New Rules of Marketing and PR, page 13_

**Marketing is shifting.** People are no longer passively sitting by watching commercials and allowing marketers to interrupt their media consumption. Instead, they are fast-forwarding through pre-recorded episodes (or downloading them online). Likewise, they have become conditioned to ignore other interrupting forms of advertising (magazine ads, radio commercials, etc.). Instead, as outlined by David Meerman Scott in _The New Rules of Marketing and PR_, these empowered individuals are turning to the internet for real-time information, and they expect to find the information they are looking for when they are looking for it. The company that has the information ready when the customers are ready is the one that will make the sale and thrive in the age of consumer 2.0.
