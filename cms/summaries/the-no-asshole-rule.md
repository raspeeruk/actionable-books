  ### Get the Assholes Out of Your Life


  > "The brief nasty stares; the teasing and jokes that are really camouflaged
  public shaming and insults; the people who treat us as invisible, who exclude
  us from minor and major gatherings—all those nasty little slices of
  organizational life—don't just hurt for a moment. They have cumulative effects
  on our mental health and our commitment to our bosses, peers, and
  organizations."- The No Asshole Rule, page 30


  Assholes obviously damage the targets of their nastiness, increasing their
  feelings of worthlessness; causing chronic fatigue, irritability, anger, and
  depression; increasing the friction between work-life (many bullying victims
  report that their stress at work comes home with them). **Overall, assholes
  make life much less satisfying for their victims.**


  What is less obvious is the effect that assholes have on bystanders and entire
  organizations. Organizations that allow assholes to remain in their presence
  (even if they accept the antics of only one highly-successful asshole) suffer
  from their tolerance. Assholes not only decrease the organizational commitment
  of their victims, but they also decrease commitment of bystanders. **People
  who witness or experience the wrath of an asshole leave their companies at a
  much higher rate than those who aren’t exposed to such shenanigans.**


  Witnesses to the bullying tend to keep their head down and not share their
  opinions out of fear that they might be persecuted next. Even when they know
  what is best for the organization, they keep their thoughts to themselves.


  **Finally, employees that work for an asshole boss often take revenge against
  the company through less scrupulous means.** They get back by stealing from
  the company.

  ### Containing Your Inner Asshole


  > "We all have the potential to act like assholes under the wrong conditions,
  when we are placed under pressure or, especially, when our workplace
  encourages everyone – especially the “best” and the “most powerful” people –
  to act that way."- The No Asshole Rule, page 12


  The easiest way to avoid assholes is to not join them in the first place. When
  applying for positions, do your best to get to know the policies of the
  organization towards high-performing assholes. Know that you have very little
  chance of turning a den of jerks into pleasant colleagues. **If you are able
  to see assholes before joining a group, you’d be advised not to join the
  group.**


  But many people get tricked into working with assholes, recruiters are
  particularly adept at hiding the nasty sides of organizations. In this case,
  reframing the way you see things can help reduce the damage done to you by
  bullies. Sutton suggests that hoping for the best, but expecting the worst
  won’t leave you disappointed when someone acts like an asshole. Remember not
  to expect an asshole to change, and you won’t be disappointed when they don’t.
  You can also look for small wins through the day, and most importantly, remain
  kind and polite. Don’t let their viciousness affect your professionalism.
  “Relentlessly responding to irate people with calmness and respect can be used
  with assholes in any workplace. If, through one conversation at a time, you
  can teach them that you aren’t going to catch their asshole poisoning, they
  may catch your calm and kindness and treat you with respect.”


  Assholes can poison an organization and all the people in it. It is paramount
  for companies to limit the damage done by assholes by implementing the no
  asshole rule. However, it is also important that we not replace assholes with
  mindless drones that agree with everything. Disagreement is healthy; members
  of organizations just need to learn how to argue respectfully.


  “Don’t replace assholes with wimps and polite clones.”

  ### Removing Assholes from Your Organization


  > "Writing, displaying, and repeating words about treating people with
  respect, but allowing or encouraging the opposite behavior, is worse than
  useless."- The No Asshole Rule, page 59


  Many companies actively denounce asshole-ish behavior, creating codes of
  ethical conduct and complicated guidelines to be enforced by human resource
  professionals. Unfortunately, not all companies take action on their verbally
  expressed and written policies, often ignoring the rules in the case of top
  performers. But at companies that successfully implement the no asshole rule,
  “phrases like ‘talented jerk,’ ‘brilliant bastard,’ and ‘an asshole and a
  superstar’ are seen as oxymorons”.


  Temporary assholes are dealt with immediately and are made to understand that
  their behavior is not acceptable. If their insidious behaviors continue, they
  are let go. Even for top performers, there should be no exception to the no
  asshole rule. Citing an example from Men’s Wearhouse, when a top salesperson
  in a store was fired for continuing to behave as an ass, the performance of
  the entire store improved (despite none of the remaining salespeople not
  selling as much as the star that was fired). It turns out that getting rid of
  high performing assholes might not be as damaging as you think.


  Its also important to remember that the no-asshole rule doesn’t just apply to
  employees; it also applies to vendors, customers, and anyone else encountered
  in the process of doing your job.

> "The evidence is ironclad: there are a lot of assholes out there." _\- The No Asshole Rule, page 24_

Though it is written as a management book, _The No Asshole Rule_ is a way of life more than a management philosophy.

Jerks, bullies, users, intimidators. All fit into Robert I. Sutton’s definition of assholes. **They are the people who leave their victims feeling depleted and bad about themselves.** Typically, they inject their venom into people with less power than themselves. The harm that they inflict on their victims, witnesses, their organizations, and themselves are very tangible and costly.

_The No Asshole Rule_ very clearly lays out the economic and psychological costs of associating with assholes and gives very practical tips to removing them from our lives.
