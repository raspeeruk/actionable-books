  ### Crafting a strategy screen


  > "Knowing why you are making a specific decision is an important strategic
  capacity because it challenges your thinking, helps you to bring others along
  in embracing strategic decisions and creates an organizational memory composed
  of the rationale for past decisions."- The Nonprofit Strategy Revolution, page
  65


  A tool that La Piana presents for how organizations can make important
  decisions is the Strategy Screen. “A Strategy Screen,” he writes, “is a set of
  criteria that your organization uses to choose whether or not a particular
  strategy is consistent with its identity.” Think of a grid. Column one will
  consist of criteria which organizations want to base decisions on. This will
  usually include 5-8 essential points. This might include: Is it consistent
  with the mission? Does it build on current competitive advantages? Will it
  reinforce our client’s view of us as a prefered choice? Each organization’s
  criteria will be different. Once a challenge emerges, the strategic team will
  list possible strategies that organization would consider to address this
  challenge in columns 2-4, or however many options they have. Teams discuss
  each option and how it measures to the criteria. This could be simply using a
  number system with ratings 0-3. Finally, the team adds up the numbers to get a
  sense of what the best choice is.


  Strategic screen is a simple concept but underused. How often because of the
  routine of doing 3-5 year marketing plans and living in a reactive environment
  do we miss out on opportunities or effective solutions? The strategic screen
  really reminds us in the nonprofit sector that the mission statement we have
  on all our printed material means something and should be in the forefront of
  our decision-making. Once the criteria for a nonprofit is formulated, it can
  be used through the organization’s departments. It is a simple but practical
  tool that should be added to best practices for nonprofits strategic planning.

  ### A fast response environment


  > "The capacity to rapidly discard failed strategies and adopt new ones is a
  major advantage of the nonprofit strategy revolution."- The Nonprofit Strategy
  Revolution, page 85


  The strategy screen allows organizations to assess possible strategies as they
  are developed. Once a criteria is implemented that the organization believes
  it should base decisions on, anyone can “scrub” their idea against the
  criteria bases. In addition, the vetting of different strategies can be done
  in a timely manner, allowing the focus to switch to implementation.
  Traditional strategic planning is a drawn out process; while the planning is
  taking place the organization is already being hit with the effects of the
  challenge. It can become more of a reactive versus proactive environment.
  Utilizing the strategic screen allows for organizations to rule out invalid
  strategy quickly. Nonprofits have to be business savvy and ready to make big
  decisions quickly as the market continues to grow and competition arises. As
  business continues to move at a faster pace, nonprofits like for profits are
  going to have to find ways to stay on top of their game to achieve their
  mission.

  ### Understanding and knowing how to respond to "Big Questions"


  > "It is just the nature of organizational life — perfection is never within
  reach. Moreover a new opportunity or challenge can arrive at any time,
  rendering our beloved way of doing things suboptimal, or even downright
  useless. Thus we should always be open to developing new strategies – and not
  just when our current strategies are in trouble."- The Nonprofit Strategy
  Revolution, page 71


  Applying real-time strategic planning creates the opportunities to make
  effective choices when met with an opportunity or challenge. These moments are
  what La Piana addresses as the Big Question. “A Big Question is an opportunity
  or threat to which the organization must respond. Usually, it is beyond the
  scope of the organization’s current strategies, thus requiring a new
  strategy.” Working in the nonprofit sector, these big questions come with new
  opportunities, when another organization can be a threat to an organization’s
  efforts, or when there is a challenge to the organization’s business model.
  The vital part is knowing how to detect these Big Question moments and then
  applying the strategic screen. The Big Question is not something hypothetical
  that traditional strategic planning tends to focus on. Big Questions are real
  and usually need to have a timely and effective response to ensure the
  efficiency of the organization.


  When I was working for a nonprofit, every time a Big Question came up the
  response from the COO was, “is it financially viable?” Which, he was right on.
  That should be an element of the strategic screen. However, it cannot be the
  only one. If organization’s solely base big questions on one factor, they
  might miss out on opportunities that will help their organization make a
  bigger impact. The concept of the strategic screen encourages organizations to
  look at multiple criteria when faced with Big Questions.
f_conclusion: >-
  The strategy screen is only one tool that La Piana offers in _The Nonprofit
  Strategy Revolution._ He provides examples as well as 27 tools which can now
  be accessed on their website. While some might think this revolution is
  outdated, I would say it’s not. From large nonprofits to small grassroots
  nonprofits, many organizations are still adopting the strategic plan that
  takes a lot of time to develop to only sit on a shelf. It’s crucial for
  organizations to stay viable and have active strategic planning. This book is
  great for new nonprofit leaders as well as people who are on business
  development teams. Best practice organizations are going to create an
  environment where staff are able to take part in strategic planning. This book
  provides great tools for staff to create productive and informative ideas to
  support the future of their nonprofit.

> "Every nonprofit leader who breaks out of the three-year planning cycle to form strategies as opportunities and challenges arise is manning the strategy revolution barricades" _\- The Nonprofit Strategy Revolution, page XV_

_The Nonprofit Strategy Revolution_ sets out to help nonprofits rethink the way they do strategic planning. The book is packed full of tools and examples of how real-time strategic planning works and how it is different than traditional strategic planning. David La Piana has built a consulting firm to help nonprofits to apply “strategic restructuring.” The book was written in 2008 and is still valuable today as the pace of business continues to increase with the help of technology. Traditional strategic planning consists of sitting with a team and building a 3-5 year strategic plan over a 6 month to year timeframe. In 2014 the issue is that many nonprofits are still doing this and according to La Piana it can be deemed ineffective. Trends and climate change rapidly and nonprofits need to be ready to adapt to those changes if they want to stay effective. Real-time strategic planning is a process that will bring in staff and board members to be ready to approach opportunities and challenges with continued responsiveness.
