  ### Know Yourself


  > "The three major fears that block action and create procrastination are the
  terror of being overwhelmed, the fear of failure and the fear of not
  finishing."- The Now Habit, page 96


  Do you procrastinate? Most people do, in some part of their lives. Would you
  like to stop procrastinating? If the answer is yes, you need to look at the
  root cause.


  **Why do you procrastinate?** Common answers to this question include “Because
  I’m lazy” and “Because I don’t feel like doing it.”


  Let’s deal with the first response. Procrastinators, in general, are not lazy.
  Procrastinators usually get things done on time. However, as they put off
  starting until the last minute, they often feel rushed, stressed and unhappy
  with the quality of their work.


  Now let’s look at the second reply: “Because I don’t feel like doing it.” This
  is getting closer to the root cause, but we need to dig deeper. The main
  reasons we put things off are: fear of being overwhelmed, fear of failure and
  fear of not finishing. There are other emotional reasons that we may
  procrastinate, for example, as a way of expressing resentment. **By uncovering
  your true source of procrastination you can deal directly with the issue.**


  Fear of failure can cause paralyzing procrastination and can therefore lead to
  failure if not addressed. Clare, a woman in her late twenties, went to see Dr.
  Fiore as she was terrified her procrastination would lead to her being fired.
  She feared having her way of working criticized, which echoed her childhood
  experience of feeling like what she did was never good enough for her parents.
  Through working on her self-confidence and self-acceptance, Clare changed her
  image of herself as a procrastinator. As she became her own source of
  approval, she was able to face work without letting external judgements cause
  fear and inertia.

  ### Support yourself


  > "Learning to stay with any fear will be much easier when you have weapons
  that give your brain alternatives to running away."- The Now Habit, page 97


  Now that you’ve taken the time to understand why you procrastinate and learned
  how to talk to yourself to stay empowered, it’s time for some tools.


  **Tool 1# – The unschedule**  

  The unschedule is great for people who have a huge project or piece of work to
  get through. For example, it’s a great way to approach writing a thesis. Many
  people who work on this task do so with the mindset that their life is on hold
  until the thesis is written. They will cancel social plans and recreational
  activities. This creates the feeling of being always working. The antidote is
  the unschedule. Instead of insisting on putting in a certain number of hours
  per day on the thesis, the unschedule starts with putting in breaks, leisure
  activities and social engagements. It puts a limit on the number of hours per
  week that is acceptable to work. This approach reduces resistance to working,
  because work is regularly rewarded with breaks and fun.


  **Tool 2# – The work of worrying**  

  Worrying can be productive, if you let it. When people worry, they think of
  how hard the task will be and consider the worst possible outcome. Why not
  channel these worries into making a plan to deal with obstacles and a
  contingency if the worst should happen?


  **Tool 3# – Persistent starting**  

  Fear of not finishing is a key cause of procrastination.Persistent starting is
  the antidote. We can only act in the present, so look to put in thirty minutes
  of quality work at a time. If you keep focusing on starting, finishing will
  take of itself.


  In what circumstances do you procrastinate? How might _The Now Habit_ help you
  to move forward in an area that’s important to you?

  ### Talk to yourself


  > "As you begin to speak to yourself in a language that focuses on results
  rather than blame, on choices rather than have to, on what is rather than what
  you think you should be, you will find that your body and mind cooperate by
  providing a positive energy free from the unnecessary struggles of the past
  and negative comparisons with the future."- The Now Habit, page 63


  As you learn why you procrastinate, you will begin to discover ways of talking
  to yourself that are not serving you. Often, when we are trying to get work
  done, we talk to ourselves in an authoritarian manner, such as “I have to do
  this” or “I should be working on that”. As one part of the brain tries to push
  for the work to be complete, another part of the brain resists and rebels.
  When we hear “You have to do this”, it implies that we don’t want to do it or
  that we have no choice.


  Rather than trying to artificially turn the thought of “I have to do this” to
  “I want to do this”, look for that third place. Telling yourself “I choose to
  do this” reclaims your power.


  Don loved being an art dealer but hated the management and detail part of the
  work. When it came to dealing with taxes or sales documents, Don would berate
  himself saying “I should have kept better records.” When he got the reports
  completed he’d tell himself “It’s not as good as it would be if I had started
  earlier.” These ways of talking to himself only reinforced the pattern of
  procrastination.


  By learning to change the way that he talked to himself, Don was able to make
  progress. If negative thoughts came up, he’d say to himself: “Yes, the records
  could be better, too bad, that’s in the past. What can I focus on doing now?”


  To avoid getting stuck with thoughts that don’t serve you, remember that you
  are the one in control. Use phrases like “I want, I choose and I decide.” This
  puts you in the driving seat on the road to productivity.

> "The Now Habit is a strategic system, that is, it goes beyond ‘how to’ advice and presents a plan based on the dynamics of procrastination and motivation." _\- The Now Habit, page 6_

**Do you complete some tasks easily, but put off some of your most meaningful work?** When you look at your to-do list, are there some tasks that just never seem to move ahead? If so, _The Now Habit_ may be for you.

I’ve long been a fan of productivity and time-management tools. I love to plan, list and categorize. I have a killer filing system and even a label-maker. I’ve read many books to learn what I can about getting work done.

Despite all these tools, some tasks and projects remain harder to move forward than others. This is where _The Now Habit_ comes in. _The Now Habit_ doesn’t just give tools. Neil Fiore takes the time to explain why we procrastinate so we can deal with the root cause, rather than the symptoms. It makes sense that the author is a doctor, as he takes the approach of diagnosing before prescribing.

_The Now Habit_ covers these areas:

*   Why and how we procrastinate
*   How to talk to yourself
*   The importance of play
*   Tools to support action
*   Working in your flow state
