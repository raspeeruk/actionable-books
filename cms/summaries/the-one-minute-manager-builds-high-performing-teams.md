  ### The Whys and Wherefores of High Performing Teams


  > "None of us is as smart as all of us."- The One Minute Manager Builds High
  Performing Teams, page 15


  Most leaders have a bias towards a traditional leadership style which is to
  listen to their team and of course provide direction. More important than
  these traditional skills is the ability to observe the team in action.


  Here’s what a skillful leader needs to observe:


  *   **Communication and participation.** Who talks to whom? Who is left out?
  Who talks most often?

  *   **Decision making.** How does the group go about selecting a course of
  action – majority rule, consensus or lack of response?

  *   **Conflict.** How is conflict handled in the group? Avoidance, compromise,
  competition, collaboration, etc.?

  *   **Leadership.** Who is influencing whom?

  *   **Goals and roles.** What is the group trying to accomplish and who does
  what?

  *   **Group norms.** Which rules governing the group’s behaviour are most
  obvious in the group?

  *   **Problem solving.** How does the group solve problems?

  *   **Group climate.** How pleasant or unpleasant does it feel?

  *   **Individual behaviour.**


  ‘All new teams need to have a sense of purpose as well as some clarity about
  team values and goals, individual roles, team norms and decision making
  procedures,’ state the authors.


  All groups regardless of their purpose go through certain stages. Groups are
  dynamic, complex, ever-changing, living systems that have behaviour patterns
  and lives of their own.


  **Stage 1 – Orientation**


  In this stage, productivity is low and morale is high.


  The team develops a team constitution or charter that sets the tone for all
  future work that it undertakes and ensures that all objectives will be met.


  ‘The team charter is a set of agreements that clearly states what the team
  wants to accomplish, why it is important and how the team will work together
  to achieve results.’


  In this stage, the team is excited and has little knowledge of the task. The
  appropriate leadership style is directing.


  **Stage 2 – Dissatisfaction**


  In this stage, the cold hard reality of the task at hand begins to register.


  The initial excitement starts to fade and the task is seen as being more
  challenging.


  ‘Although this stage is characterized by power struggles and conflict, it also
  is the seedbed of creativity and valuing differences.’


  In this stage, the appropriate leadership style is coaching.


  **Stage 3 – Integration**


  Team members begin to understand each other and feel comfortable working
  together to resolve differences. In turn, team members develop confidence in
  each other and s sense of cohesion develops.


  In this stage, disagreement is encouraged and the team works together to solve
  differences and begin to manage itself. Encouraging disagreement can help
  prevent groupthink where the members are afraid of disagreement, leading to
  stagnation and a loss of innovation.


  The appropriate leadership style is supporting.


  **Stage 4 – Production**


  The team is knowledgeable of its values, goals, responsibilities, and
  deliverables.


  The appropriate leadership style is delegating.

  ### Empowerment


  > "Your job as a leader is to educate your people, to help them develop to the
  point where they can take responsibility for their work and to give them
  opportunities to perform."- The One Minute Manager Builds High Performing
  Teams, page 96


  Your primary job is to develop your people.


  What does this look like in practice?


  It means that as a leader you start to view yourself as an educator as well as
  a leader. Your job then becomes to empower your team members and give them
  opportunities to develop their skills and knowledge. This creates an
  environment where they can proactively take responsibility, be creative and
  feel free to take risks and make mistakes.


  As the authors remind us, ‘Empowerment is all about letting go so that others
  can get going.’


  In conclusion, let’s remember that the people we manage are our most important
  resources.


  As a leader, you must be multi-skilled. You must be an enabler of people _and_
  a facilitator of teams.

  ### Situational Leadership


  > "Effective leaders adjust their style to provide what the group can’t
  provide for itself."- The One Minute Manager Builds High Performing Teams,
  page 68


  There is no single best style of leadership. The exceptional leader needs to
  change his/her style according to the current needs of the team. This is also
  referred to as situational leadership.


  Depending upon the needs of the team, the situational leader adjusts the level
  of supervision or intervention to meet the individual’s circumstances.


  It is up to the leader to change his/her style and not for the follower to
  adapt to the leader’s style.


  ‘Your job as a manager is to help people and teams develop so they have
  competence and commitment and the ability to share in making decisions,’ write
  the authors. ‘A high performing team is more creative and better at problem
  solving than any individual functioning alone.’

In order for an organization to function at a high level, the concept of teamwork and managing the people in the team is one of the most important keys to success.

So how do you know when you have a high performing team?

They will most likely display the following characteristics: purpose and values, empowerment, relationships and communication, flexibility, optimal performance, recognition and appreciation, morale.

When your team has all or most of the characteristics, you will find that tasks, goals and projects are accomplished with amazing efficiency, speed and efficacy. What may have seemed daunting and overwhelming, now becomes easy and effortless.

In _The One Minute Manager Builds High Performing Teams_, the authors (Ken Blanchard, Donald Carew and Eunice Parisi-Carew) reveal the whole process of developing a high performing team which involves three major skills on the part of team leaders and team members as well: diagnosis, adaptability and empowerment.
