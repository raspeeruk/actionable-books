  ### Free Your Time


  > "The more you get rid of your people’s monkeys, the more time you have for
  your people."- The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, page 70


  As a manager, when you stop doing your team member’s work and hand back
  responsibility to them, what magically happens is that you free up your time
  which you can then spend on your own monkeys!


  _‘They can see me as often as they wish (which is not very often) and for as
  long as they wish (which is not very long)_,’ the authors write.


  No longer will you have frustrated staff with a boss who doesn’t have time for
  them.


  As the One Minute Manager explains, _‘That is accomplished by expanding the
  amount of time I have for them and contracting the amount of time they have
  for me. If they are running out of time more often than I am, that’s a good
  indicator of their increasing self-reliance.’_

  ### Learn to Delegate


  > "The ultimate degree of management is delegation, where my people are
  achieving more and more with less and less involvement from me."- The One
  Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, page 110


  How do you know you have achieved the ultimate goal of delegation?


  The first sign is that your mentality changes from that of a doer to that of a
  manager. You stop thinking of your ‘to-do’ list and instead start thinking of
  your ‘to-delegate’ list.


  ‘You learn to replace the psychological rewards of doing with the rewards of
  managing i.e. deriving satisfaction from what people do and being recognized,
  paid and promoted accordingly,’ write the authors.


  The second sign is an enhanced relationship with team members and an
  improvement in productivity and morale. The manager develops a high level of
  confidence in the team members and in turn team members feel valued,
  appreciated and recognized for their contribution.


  ‘When people throughout the organization have responsibility for managing
  their own monkeys, it’s hard to tell who’s a worker and who’s a manager
  because everyone is committed to doing what it takes to do the best job
  possible.’

  ### Hand Back Responsibility


  > "As a Manager, to the extent that you can get people to care for and feed
  their own monkeys, they are really managing the work for themselves."- The One
  Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, page 74


  It is sometimes challenging for managers to allow team members to take
  responsibility for their projects and tasks for a myriad of reasons which
  include:


  1.  They may feel like they are abdicating responsibility

  2.  They may lack confidence in the team member’s ability

  3.  They may simply be a control freak!


  In Onken’s Rules of Monkey Management, the One Minute Manager details exactly
  how this liberation can take place with elegance, simplicity and most
  importantly, peace of mind for the manager.


  **Oncken’s Rules of Monkey Management**


  1.  **Descriptions** – The dialog must not end until appropriate ‘next moves’
  have been identified and specified.

  2.  **Owners** – ‘The monkey is assigned to a person. All monkeys shall be
  owned and handled at the lowest organizational level consistent with their
  welfare. The dialog between boss and staff member must not end until ownership
  of each monkey is assigned to a person.’ People take better care of things
  they own than things they don’t.

  3.  **Insurance Policies** – ‘The risk is covered. Every monkey leaving your
  presence on the back of one of your people must be covered by one of two
  insurance policies: 1) Recommend, then 2) Act, then 3) Advise.’

  4.  **Monkey Feeding and Checkup Appointments** – ‘The time and place for
  follow-up is specified.’


  What then ends up happening is that the manager keeps only the monkeys that
  only she/he can handle. The rest are now handled by team members who have
  grown in confidence and capability as a result of the increased autonomy.


  ‘The best way to develop responsibility in people is to give them
  responsibility,’ says Blanchard and Oncken.


  When the manager demands excellence from himself/herself, he then has the
  right to expect and ask the same from team members. One way to accomplish this
  is to always ask ‘Is this the absolute best you can do on this?’
f_conclusion: >-
  Let’s remember that there will always be more next moves (monkeys) than there
  is time to complete them. So, our goal both at work and in our personal lives
  is to ensure that we are prioritising the important tasks and letting go of
  (or delegating) the unimportant ones.

> "Things not worth doing are not worth doing well." _\- The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey, page 50_

As a manager, have you ever found yourself in the unenviable position of having too few hours in the day to accomplish your tasks?

Do you find yourself asking this question ‘I thought hiring new team members would make my life easier?’

‘Why is it that some managers are typically running out of time while their staff are typically running out of work?’ ask, Ken Blanchard, William Oncken Jr. and Hal Burrows, the authors of _The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey_.

The answer can be found in what is referred to as the ‘Monkey’ problem.

A ‘Monkey’ is defined as the next move for every task or project to be carried out in an organisation.

For every ‘Monkey’ there are two people involved, one to perform the next move (usually the subordinate) and one to supervise it (usually the manager).

Problems arise when the manager takes over responsibility for the ‘Monkey’ which effectively makes him/her the worker and turns the subordinate into a supervisor.

In _The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey_, the authors reveal exactly how managers can avoid these self-inflicted problems and become effective supervisors of time, energy and people.
