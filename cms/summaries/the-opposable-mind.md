  ### Your Rubik's Lens


  > "Integrative thinking shows us a way past the binary limits of either-or. It
  shows us that there’s a way to integrate the advantages of one solution
  without cancelling out the advantages of an alternative solution. Integrative
  thinking affords us, in the words of the poet Wallace Stevens, ‘the choice not
  between, but of.’"- The Opposable Mind, page 9


  The human mind is a wonderful thing. From early in our childhood development,
  our minds begin to categorize and filter information vital to our survival.
  Through education and experience, we start to qualify objects, people and
  events as “safe” or “dangerous”, “beneficial” or “detrimental”. We do this for
  our own safety and survival, and we do it unconsciously as we grow. While the
  function of this process is strictly to keep us safe from physical harm, it
  actually begins to shape the way we see the world – a lens through which we
  experience reality, if you will. Virtually as soon as we are conscious of our
  actions, none of us are capable of seeing the world completely objectively, as
  we all see reality through the tint of our own upbringing.


  Integrative thinking is about testing and expanding our own “lens” (or
  “reality-model”, as Martin calls it) by comparing and contrasting it with the
  lenses of the people around us, constantly seeking new, better alternatives to
  all. It’s about having a certain level of expectation as to what a solution
  could look like and refusing to lower that expectation simply because the
  ideal solution doesn’t yet exist.


  According to Martin, there are six beliefs or “stances” that are possessed by
  leaders who practice integrative thinking:


  **Belief #1**: The current solutions or models for a situation are simply the
  best solutions or models created to date, and not the absolute best solution
  available.  

  **Belief #2**: Conflicting solutions or models are not to be feared or
  resisted, but rather to be learned from, adding to the available data for
  study and creation of a new, superior model.  

  **Belief #3**: Better solutions are available, they are just yet to be
  discovered.  

  **Belief #4**: They are personally capable of creating or leading the creation
  of that better model from abstraction to reality.  

  **Belief #5:** “Messiness” or complexity of options and components is actually
  a good thing, as it assures no details (or fewer, at any rate) are being
  missed in the creation of an ideal solution.  

  **Belief #6**: Patience is needed to create the better model.


  It is Martin’s belief that we can expand our own capacity for integrative
  thinking through constant experience and reflection.

  ### Get Messy


  > "Integrative thinkers don’t mind the mess. In fact, they welcome it, because
  the mess assures them that they haven’t edited out features that are necessary
  to the contemplation of the problem as a whole. They welcome complexity
  because they know the best answers arise from complexity."- The Opposable
  Mind, page 41


  Simple options breed simple results. Typical results. Pre-planned results. If
  you want to create a new, better model – one that considers more aspects of
  true reality (and not just your own lens), you need to be willing to consider
  more details than those who came before you. You need to go looking for more
  “salient factors”, as Martin calls them – more potential pieces of the better
  picture.


  Do you know all the details of what it is you want to change? Issy Sharp
  interviewed hundreds of his guests, at both hotels, to better learn what they
  really wanted. Not only that, he studied all aspects of the hotel experience –
  from amenities to the check in/check out process, staff feedback and needs,
  and beyond. He didn’t build the new Four Seasons model to represent his
  version of a better hotel, he instead collected more data on what a better
  hotel would look like. He went beyond his own reality-model.


  While having both mastery and originality play key roles in successfully
  creating a new model, collecting a wide amount of data, and being willing to
  sift through that data – patiently and with purpose – are also key factors to
  success.

  ### Learn from Picasso


  > "“The great ones utilize their experiences to build and deepen their mastery
  while maintaining and expressing their originality. Average leaders do one or
  the other.”"- The Opposable Mind, page 185


  Even those who don’t have an intimate knowledge of the art world probably
  recognize the name Pablo Picasso. Renowned as one of the fathers of modern art
  and the uncontested creator of the Cubism painting style, Picasso is
  remembered for his originality. And yet, as Martin reminds us, Picasso has
  often times attributed his pioneering skill to his deep roots in traditional
  forms of painting. It was his mastery of the dominant styles of his time that
  allowed him the opportunity and insight to see where things could be
  effectively adapted and changed.


  True innovators overcame the weaknesses of existing models because they have
  become intimately familiar with them first, before they were able to create
  lasting change. The old admonishment for want-to-be-authors – “write what you
  know” – comes from the same lesson: you need to know something to the level of
  mastery before you can start to inject effective originality. Issy Sharpe, as
  case in point, created and ran two successful hotels (one of each existent
  model) before he had the insight and skill to create the successful third.


  If you want to see change in the world, immerse yourself in the existing
  models first, so you can clearly identify the points that need changing.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Opposable Mind_ is a groundbreaking book on a topic that, in this age of
  information overload, will play an ever increasingly crucial role in the lives
  of leaders. To avoid overload, it can be so tempting to specialize, to
  simplify, focusing on a small part of the whole as we attempt to improve or
  “fix”. While simplification certainly makes decisions easier, it hardly ever
  makes them better. Martin’s message, in a nutshell, is this: next time you
  find yourself with an either-or decision to make, take a step back, take a
  breath, and see if you can’t find an “and” that surpasses both. Life’s a
  puzzle. Focus on the big picture.

Think of a Rubik’s cube. Those who can complete one (i.e. put all the coloured tiles where they belong) will tell you that one of the keys to accomplishment is keeping all the other tiles in mind while focusing on completing a certain placement. It’s not simply a matter of completing one side to the exclusion of the others, but rather the process of building one side while maintaining or building the others as well. Author/professor Roger Martin explains this process to be “integrative thinking”; the ability to face constructively the tension of opposing ideas and, instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is superior to each.

Silly example? Maybe. And yet people fall back onto “either-or” choices all the time. Consider the story of Issy Sharp, a hotelier interested in creating a new type of guest experience. He was told there were only two ways to run hotels: 1) small and intimate, but lacking enough guest rooms to support amenities like gyms, pools or business centres or, 2) large, fully equipped hotels that, due to their size, were run with cold and impersonal service. Sharp refused to accept the two existent models, choosing instead to take the best of each and create something entirely new: a hotel chain built around the exact desires (both spoken and unspoken) of his ideal clientele; huge capacity, yet with a complete and personalized catering to the guests’ individual needs. The hugely successful Four Seasons was the result.

_The Opposable Mind_ teaches that leaders – true innovators – have the remarkable ability to hold two contradictory thoughts in their minds at one time and then work through the unique strengths and challenges of each to create an even better third option. In _The Opposable Mind_, Martin examines the topic brilliantly and, perhaps most important to our conversation, teaches how you can develop a more opposable mind yourself.
