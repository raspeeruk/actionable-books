  ### Decision overload


  > "Millions of neurons are constantly monitoring the environment to select the
  most important things for us to focus on"- The Organized Mind, page 7


  Three hundred years ago, someone with a college degree in “science” knew,
  well, everything there was to know. Now you can have a PhD in biology and
  barely cover the nervous system of the squid.


  In 1976 when, as a kid, I went grocery shopping with my mom, there were about
  9,000 products from which to choose the 150 items she would typically use.
  Now, when she goes grocery shopping with me, we choose our 150 items from a
  whopping 40,000 choices.


  While she was exposed to the equivalent of 1 newspaper of information a day, I
  am exposed to the equivalent of 175 newspapers of information daily.


  Our brains have the ability to process the information we take in but at a
  cost. Processing the trivial from the important burns energy. Neuroscientists
  have discovered that **lack of productivity and loss of drive can result from
  decision overload.**


  **It’s as though our brains are configured to make a certain number of
  decisions per day and once we reach that limit, we can’t make any more.**
  Every Tweet, text, Facebook post is competing for resources in our brains to
  make decisions.


  On a daily basis, you likely think about what foods you are feeding your body
  for maximum performance. How often do you think about what information you are
  feeding your brain, or your children’s brains?


  For maximum performance, you need attention filters. Steve Jobs wore the same
  black t-shirt every day to remove that one decision from his day. What filters
  can you add to your day to reduce the energy consumption required to process
  decisions? Here are some ideas I’m incorporating:


  *   Automatic payments

  *   Once a week menu planning

  *   Create daily routine like scheduling exercise with a friend

  *   Password systems


  Please share below your ideas to reduce the number of decisions you need to
  process each day.

  ### Winning the productivity battle


  > "Studies have found that productivity goes up when the number of hours per
  week of work goes down…."- The Organized Mind, page 307


  You may think that you need to just work longer and harder to manage the
  overload. Given the vast number of vacation days that go unused each year, it
  seems that is how many of us have dealt with it. The irony however, Levitin
  discovered, is that the companies that are winning the productivity battle are
  those that:


  *   allow (even encourage!) employees productivity hours, naps and exercise

  *   create a calm, tranquil, orderly environment


  As you may have heard, Sweden has recently (Oct, 2015) switched to a 6-hour
  workday and it’s turning out great! In North America take Google for example,
  who put Ping-Pong tables in their headquarters. Safeway, a $4 billion grocery
  chain has doubled sales in the last fifteen years. They are encouraged through
  salary incentives to exercise at the corporate gym.


  Consider these interesting facts about work, sleep and vacation time.


  1) **Work time:** Leisure and refueling time pays off for everyone. A
  sixty-hour work week, although 50% longer than a forty-hour work week, reduces
  productivity by 25%. It takes 2 hours of overtime to accomplish one hour of
  work!


  2) **Sleep time:** A ten-minute nap can be the equivalent of an extra hour and
  a half of sleep at night.


  3) **Vacation time:** For each additional ten hours of vacation their
  employees took, their year-end performance ratings from their supervisors
  improved by 8%.

  ### Multitasking simply doesn't work


  > "Cognitive losses from multitasking are even greater than the cognitive
  losses from pot smoking."- The Organized Mind, page 97


  With the plethora of information available to us, you may want to cut some
  corners by multitasking. Not so fast. There’s a fly in the ointment of
  multitasking. Even when you think you are successfully doing many things at
  once, it is actually a diabolical and powerful illusion.


  Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at MIT and one of the world’s experts on divided
  attention, says that our brains are “not wired to multitask well…. When people
  think they’re multi-tasking, they’re actually just switching from one task to
  another very rapidly. And every time they do, there’s a cognitive cost in
  doing so.”


  Ironically, multitasking makes us demonstrably less efficient by:


  *   increasing the production of the stress hormone cortisol

  *   increasing adrenaline, which can cause mental fog or scrambled thinking

  *   creating a dopamine-addiction feedback loop – which rewards the brain for
  losing focus and causes us to continually search for external stimulus


  In the end, instead of reaping the rewards from sustained, focused effort, we
  instead reap empty rewards from completing a thousand little and insignificant
  tasks.


  I was on a transatlantic flight the other day and had the most productive
  workday I’d had in months. I spoke with my colleague who admitted he is always
  most productive on a plane. Why? Distractions are eliminated.


  The secret then is to trick our brains to stay on task. I therefore plan to


  *   block “flight times” to focus on specific projects. During that time I
  will close my door and turn off my cell to avoid texts and calls. One of my
  favorite tricks is to escape to my local coffee shop with just one project to
  focus on for a specific amount of time.

  *   book just 3 times of the day (7am, 1pm, 4pm) to answer email

  *   change my settings to remove the notification that “I’ve got mail” so I
  don’t invite the “squirrel” to show up.


  What about you?
f_conclusion: >-
  Living in this era of information overload poses new challenges for our
  generation. Getting organized can bring us all to the next level in our lives.
  Levitin suggests that we must consciously find areas in our life that need
  cleaning up, and then methodically and proactively do so. And then keep doing
  so.

> "A funny thing happened on the way to the twenty-first century: The plethora of information and the technologies that serve it changed the way we use our brains." _\- The Organized Mind, page 16_

In today’s world, it is easy to suffer from information and decision over-load. This can lead to a disorganized mind. The average person is sleep-deprived, overstressed, and not making enough time for things he/she wants to do. What about you? Some of us are doing better than others. Daniel Levitin shares, in _The Organized Mind_, what they are doing.

The heart of this book is about organizing our time better. Not just so we can be more productive but so we can have more time for fun, for play, for meaningful relationships, and for creativity.

We live in a day far different from our ancestors. So we need new systems to manage. The systems Levitin shares can make a profound difference. There is no one system that will work for everyone. The general principles he shares can be applied in your own way to recapture a sense of order and regain hours lost trying to overcome the disorganized mind. Below are three ideas that resonate with me.
