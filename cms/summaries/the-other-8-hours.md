  ### Uncover your ideal life


  > "A meaningful life is what The Other 8 Hours is all about. Since most people
  don’t get a lot of meaning from sleep or work, our last hope is to find
  meaning during the other 8 hours. If we can fill some of this time with
  identifying and reaching our purpose, our lives will be much more satisfying
  and full."- The Other 8 Hours, page 233


  Pagliarini refers to it as finding your pulse and uncovering your ideal life.
  Get out of survival mode and look forward to thriving. “You need to get clear
  on what ‘get a life’ means to you, and you need to invest the other 8 hours in
  activities that enrich you and bring you closer to your ideal.”


  Pagliarini offers several ways to help us figure out what our ideal life would
  look like. He suggests starting out by embracing the gap, which he refers to
  the divide between where you are and where you want to be. Going through the
  different areas of your life—family, health, finances, and growth—you can
  identify gaps in a particular area.


  Once you’ve identified gaps, prioritize and set goals for the areas you want
  to begin work on. He offers suggestions for dealing with setbacks such as
  anticipating as many roadblocks as you can to prepare yourself for obstacles.
  Brainstorm solutions before being confronted with them.

  ### Become a Creator and Monetize your Passions


  > "Sometimes you need to do something new and different to succeed."- The
  Other 8 Hours, page 82


  You’ve freed up your other 8 hours and figured out what you would enjoy doing
  more of. Use that newfound knowledge to start creating a new stream of income.


  A creator is someone who produces or develops a side project or venture that
  brings inspiration to his life. The kind of “excitement you can feel when you
  are creating something you are passionate about.”


  An initial consideration is a cost/benefit analysis. How much effort and money
  will the side venture require compared to results generated? Given the time
  constraints, focus on high leverage activities providing the greatest results
  from the least effort.


  In addition, consider your unique talents, skills and experience to “produce
  the most value”. You don’t want to spend a year learning the business before
  you see a pay-off. Stick to your circle of competence. The author goes on to
  list several side gigs including starting a blog, freelancing as well as
  reselling and affiliating (via Amazon).

  ### Re-gain control of your time


  > "Reclaiming as much of the other 8 hours as possible is our first goal
  because without it, we are stuck… The more of the other 8 hours you have, the
  more you can focus on those pursuits that make your life more fulfilled and
  get you closer to reaching your goals."- The Other 8 Hours, page 33


  In order to maximize the other 8 hours, we need to ensure we have the time and
  energy to work on the pursuits we want to. Taking control of your time and
  identifying non-essential tasks is the first step. Pagliarini calls this PERK,
  which he identifies as Postpone, Eliminate, Reduce or Keep. Are there any
  unimportant and unsatisfying tasks that can be put off or eliminated to free
  up your time, such as excessive TV watching?


  A related suggestion to PERK is to outsource activities that take a ton of
  your time and you don’t enjoy doing. This is especially helpful if you have a
  little extra cash but are short on time. There are numerous companies
  providing outsourcing services at various price levels.


  One unconventional recommendation is something the author calls frictionless
  reciprocation. He describes this as doing a valuable task for someone without
  it requiring any additional use of your time. An example would be cooking a
  meal for a neighbor in exchange for him mowing your lawn. Cooking an extra
  serving of a meal requires minimal additional effort and is something you
  planned on doing anyway.


  Once you’ve figured out what you want and freed up your time, become a
  creator.

> "The Other 8 Hours is all about investing your time in activities that pay the highest returns—w whether the returns are financial, physical or spiritual. How you invest your other 8 hours determines your happiness and financial success." _\- The Other 8 Hours, page 59_

Although we don’t realize it, most of our most significant achievements and relationships occur in the 8 hours we’re not working or sleeping. The author calls these the “other 8 hours.”

In _The Other 8 Hours: Maximize your Free Time to Create New Wealth and Purpose,_ Robert Pagliarini asserts that we can take control of these hours to achieve what we want. For some of us, that might be more personal time with our families; for others it could be pursuing a side venture generating an extra income stream.

The author is a financial planner who’s written several books and appeared as a financial expert on numerous television shows. He’s used his other 8 hours to productively build his financial planning practice and distills his wisdom in this highly practical book.
