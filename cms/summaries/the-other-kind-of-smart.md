  ### We Can Change


  > "The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter
  their lives by changing the attitude of the mind."- William James,
  Psychologist and Philosopher, quoted in The Other Kind of Smart, page 9


  First off, how good it is to know we can change what we’ve learned in the past
  and instead master better ways of interacting with the world around us.


  Unlike our IQ, EQ is not fixed or only developed at a certain stage in life.
  It’s been shown that life experiences can be used to increase EQ. In other
  words, we can continue to develop our capacity to adapt as we grow older. In
  fact, emotional intelligence is a realm that actually rewards us for
  successfully having gone through the stages of our lives.


  Further, by crafting better relationships in one area of our lives, our
  capacity and ability to build in other areas is increased. Thereby, we lead
  more fulfilling lives. Makes sense… And, the journey begins with us.

  ### Building Healthy Relationships


  > "Love thy neighbor as thyself, but choose they neighborhood."- Louise Beal,
  author, quoted in The Other Kind of Smart, page 87


  While Emotional Self-Awareness deals with our inner world, Healthy
  Relationships concern our outer world. And, we don’t just mean partnerships.
  This dimension pertains work-wise and otherwise.


  The common element is the relationship we develop with ourselves. Unless we’ve
  done the work necessary to make our inner landscape a good place to be, we’ve
  little to no chance of creating a strong outer world.


  To bump up the solidity of all your relationships:


  *   **Ask people questions about themselves.** Don’t worry about getting too
  personal (within reason, of course), as people love to talk about themselves.

  *   **When talking to others, pay attention to the amount of time you speak
  versus listen.** If you find yourself “center stage” more than 50 percent of
  the time, make a conscious effort to curtail talking and spend more time
  listening.

  *   **Do random acts of kindness.** At the office, bring in treats
  unexpectedly. Give flowers to your partner (no, it doesn’t depend whether male
  or female) when there is no special occasion. Mark this in your calendar until
  it becomes second nature.

  ### Boosting Emotional Self-Awareness


  > "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the
  easiest person to fool."- Richard Feynman, Physicist and Nobel Laureate,
  quoted in The Other Kind of Smart, page 35


  The amount of work we’ll have to do, and the effort necessary for us to change
  our inner landscape, depends on where we’re starting from.


  If we were raised to believe our emotions were bad and we needed to keep them
  under wraps at all times, we may have buried them so deeply that we have
  trouble accessing them. But access we must. Repressed emotions have and will
  continue to hurt us unless we bring them into our awareness and deal with
  them.


  To increase emotional self-awareness:


  *   **Take ten minutes every day.** Close your eyes and concentrate on your
  feelings. Be aware of tenseness in your body. Re-create events of the day that
  generated strong emotions. Try to find the original source. For example, if
  someone made you angry, did they remind you of a person in your past?

  *   **Force yourself to not respond for at least ten seconds.** If you do find
  yourself reacting from anger, fear, shame or guilt, ask yourself afterward how
  you could have reacted differently. Next time, deal with it that way.

  *   **Every day look for an opportunity to share at least one positive
  emotion.** Tell someone if something they did made you feel good.

In _The Other Kind of Smart_, Harvey Deutschendorf delivers on his promise to provide “simple ways to boost your emotional intelligence (EI) for greater personal effectiveness and success”. Filled with inspiring stories from companies who have tapped into the power of EI – along with profiles of people facing real-world dilemmas and easy-to-implement action plans – this important book opens our eyes to crucial (yet often ignored) life lessons.

### Building Healthy Relationships

While Emotional Self-Awareness deals with our inner world, Healthy Relationships concern our outer world. And, we don’t just mean partnerships. This dimension pertains work-wise and otherwise.

The common element is the relationship we develop with ourselves. Unless we’ve done the work necessary to make our inner landscape a good place to be, we’ve little to no chance of creating a strong outer world.

Plus, the extras don’t stop there. I particularly found added value within the chapters on “EI in Your Life”. Getting real is all about giving up on being a victim.

As to where we begin, I love the notion that areas of our lives needing improvement should be seen as temporary indicators, not permanent. Instead, cultivating an attitude of gratitude will be an essential ingredient toward our ongoing success.

As Deutschendorf himself declares, the most powerful tool is the one people apply. Unlike the “dry tomes” dealing with emotional intelligence I’ve been exposed to, this one is highly relevant and therefore useful.
