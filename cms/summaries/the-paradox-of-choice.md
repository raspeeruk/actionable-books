  ### Satisfice more and maximize less


  > "Learning to accept good enough will simplify decision making and increase
  satisfaction."- The Paradox of Choice, page 224


  Schwartz breaks down decision-makers into two types—**maximizers** and
  **satisficers**. Maximizers look for the best in every decision they make.
  They study every alternative and consider the opportunity costs of all
  decisions and options not taken. This requires time and effort and in a
  choice-saturated world; maximizers can easily be overwhelmed by all these
  selections.


  Satisficers, on the other hand, focus on what is good enough. They have
  pre-determined criteria and standards and don’t worry about there being
  something better out there. When they find something they like, they stop
  looking.


  Research quoted in his book shows that maximizers regret their decisions more
  than satisficers, worry about missed opportunities, are more likely to be
  unhappy, and engage in more social comparison. Social comparison involves
  comparing the decision made to what you had hoped it would be or comparing it
  to what others have selected.


  “Maximizers will put the most work into their decisions and have the highest
  expectations about the results of those decisions, and thus will be the most
  disappointed,” Schwartz writes.


  The first step is to reduce maximizing as you become aware of it and
  incorporate more satisficing into your decision making whenever possible.
  Reflect on which decisions qualify for good enough and apply it consistently.
  He also suggests developing “well-defined standards for what is good enough”
  as detailed in the first GEM.

  ### Practice gratitude to minimize regret


  > "The more options there are, the more if only’s you will generate. And with
  each if only you generate will come a little more regret and a little less
  satisfaction with the choice you actually made."- The Paradox of Choice, page
  163


  Regret for making the incorrect choice is always a possibility with the
  endless choices available in our society. With the internet making comparisons
  instantaneous, we’re always on the lookout for the best deal out there. Based
  on studies, Schwartz claims that we usually “choose the option that minimizes
  the chances that we will experience regret.”


  His suggestion for minimizing regret is to practice gratitude and “remind
  yourself of how good things actually are instead of focusing on how they’re
  less good than they were at first.” Keep a daily list of what you’re grateful
  for. Following a major decision, practice gratitude for what is good rather
  than focusing on the negatives. Stop searching for the best or perfect option
  and be content.

  ### Develop rules and standards to replace decision-making


  > "A way of easing the burden that freedom of choice imposes is to make
  decisions about when to make decisions."- The Paradox of Choice, page 113


  Setting limits on the choices we have to make can be liberating. The author
  suggests setting rules, standards and protocols for certain situations to
  minimize decision-making. Decide when to decide.


  Regarding standards, he suggests dividing the choices into two options: those
  that meet the standard and those that do not. When a choice comes along,
  compare it to the criteria and stop second-guessing. This can be applied to
  shopping for clothes, cars, making an investment decision or where to spend
  your vacation. “Deciding that once we find something that meets our standards
  we’ll stick with it essentially takes away that area of decision making.”


  An example he refers to is the choice of friends, which we select based on
  standards we set. He asserts that “We don’t make a choice every day, about
  whether to maintain the friendship; we just do.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Reducing choice overload is instrumental to becoming happier with our
  decisions and diminishing regret from bad choices. Know when to make a
  decision and when to rely on a standard or rule you’ve set. Spend less time
  comparing yourself to someone else and more time focusing on what you care
  about. As the author notes, “We must decide which choices in our lives really
  matter and focus our time and energy there.”

  "Nobody has the time or cognitive resources to be completely thorough and
  accurate with every decision, and as more decisions are required and more
  options are available, the challenge of doing the decision making correctly
  becomes ever more difficult to meet."

> "Nobody has the time or cognitive resources to be completely thorough and accurate with every decision, and as more decisions are required and more options are available, the challenge of doing the decision making correctly becomes ever more difficult to meet." _\- Paradox of Choice, page 74_

In a world saturated with endless choices, one would think that more is better. But in Barry Schwartz’s _The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less, How the Culture of Abundance Robs us of Satisfaction,_ he proves that the opposite is true. He asserts that with more options available, making choices may involve trade-offs and opportunity costs, resulting in psychological distress, indecision and regret from making the wrong choice.

Schwartz is a psychologist and the Dorwin Cartwright Professor of Social Theory and Social Action at Swarthmore College. He has written on the topic of choice overload for multiple publications and consulted as well with many organizations. He believes that the stress and regret of making the wrong decision can be mitigated by reducing the need to have the best of everything and focusing instead on what is good enough.
