  ### Mental Models


  > "To improve your business skills, you don’t need to learn everything there
  is to know—mastering the fundamentals can take you surprisingly far. I call
  these foundational business concepts mental models, and together, they create
  a solid framework you can rely on to make good decisions."- The Personal MBA,
  page 4


  Everybody learns in different ways. We all have our own best practices for how
  we learn. Some of us have a handle on this and some don’t. What Josh
  introduces with his “mental models” is a universal framework for learning
  business concepts.


  Through the understanding and application of Josh’s mental models, we build a
  solid foundation – a framework of business thinking that produces clarity of
  understanding for tackling the more complex business disciplines. Building a
  solid business mental model framework is the subject of chapters 2 thru 6 in
  _The Personal MBA_. These chapters discuss the five core disciplines of every
  business.


  The five foundation models are: (1) Value Creation, (2) Marketing, (3) Sales,
  (4) Value Delivery, and (5) Finance. Josh provides a brief outline of each
  model and how other models interact with the given model under review. His
  discussion of these five models focuses on vocabulary, principles, and
  concepts. Each model peels back understanding so we come away with the
  concepts and principles that govern how this model works in the real world.
  Also discussed is how the model under study impacts, and is impacted by, other
  models. We see how none of these models are independent.


  The mental model framework is a good aid for understanding this material. It
  helps us develop a solid foundation in the five core disciplines; disciplines
  that factor into all business. The models also help us to better frame our
  thinking around the soft-side disciplines as well. This way of distilling
  complex principles into a usable format will be helpful to most.

  ### Working With Yourself


  > "In today’s busy business environment, it’s easy to get stressed about
  everything that needs to be done. Learning how to work effectively and
  efficiently can be the difference between a fulfilling career and a draining
  one."- The Personal MBA, page 228


  Before we can work effectively with others, we must learn to work with
  ourselves. This is a little more involved than you might think. For example,
  Josh describes the concept of “Monoidealism” as focusing your energy and
  attention on one thing, and doing it without conflicts. Have you ever tried
  this? It’s not easy. This is being in the “zone”, or as the author states,
  being in a state of
  “[flow](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/finding-flow/)”. He elaborates by
  saying “There are no distractions, no interruptions, no self-judgments, no
  doubts” (pg 229).


  The first step to a Monoideal state is to eliminate all distractions and
  interruptions (which, around my place, is virtually impossible). Josh says it
  can take from ten to thirty minutes for your mind to get in tune with what you
  are doing. He goes on to state that eliminating distractions is priority
  number one. He offers up the suggestion of ear plugs and disconnecting the
  phone and internet as ways to prevent interruption. Another valuable tip was
  the idea of the “dash”: Spend anywhere from ten to thirty minutes in a burst
  of focused work. “Dashing” (and knowing that you’re only committed for 30
  minutes) can be a great way to maintain focus. Meditation, and focusing on our
  breathing can also be excellent tools for achieving a Monoideal state.


  Once we have prepared to “do”, what next? Here the author outlines the four
  methods of completion. This is interesting in that “completion”, as defined by
  Josh, may not entail us having to do the task. An example would be deletion,
  or just eliminating the task altogether. What about delegation? He includes
  delegating as a form of completion as well. You could also defer the task to
  another time—thus, conserving your energy and maintaining focus. Finally, you
  could just do the task. I really like the idea of deletion. What about you? Do
  you have tasks on your list that keep resurfacing but never get completed? Try
  deletion.


  We can start with what Josh coins the “Most Important Task” or MIT. He
  recommends creating a daily list of two or three MIT’s. He offers up the
  suggestion of creating artificial deadlines as a way to stay engaged to
  completion. The “Next Action” mental model will help keep you progressing.
  Here Josh outlines David Allen’s [Getting Things
  Done](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/getting-things-done/) method for
  moving a project forward. (1) Write down the project, (2) describe your ideal
  outcome in a single sentence, (3) write down the Next Action necessary to
  moving forward, and (4) Collect the answers in a trusted system. Do you have a
  trusted task management system?


  All this stuff is no good if you don’t put it to work. I especially like
  Josh’s idea of a Personal Research and Development account as a way to budget
  the cost of acquiring new skills. First, he discusses R & D in relationship to
  personal development and acquiring new skill sets. Second, he recommends you
  establish a monthly set-aside (say 5%) of your income for purchasing the
  tools, books, classes, and seminars necessary to your success. In his words:
  “New skills create new opportunities, and new opportunities often translate
  into more income” (pg 271). What new skills would be worth you setting aside a
  portion of your income to acquire?

  ### Our Brain


  > "Understanding how we take in information, how we make decisions, and how we
  decide what to do or what not to do is critically important if you want to
  create and sustain a successful business venture."- The Personal MBA, page 184


  As mentioned earlier, Josh also covers the “soft side” of business in _The
  Personal MBA_. Here we learn about how our brain’s function with a focus on
  business disciplines and the processes and systems we have at our cerebral
  disposal. This is about how our brains operate – how we can better utilize our
  mental faculties through a deeper understanding of how the brain functions.


  The key to brain function is what the author calls your “Gas Tank”. We need to
  keep this gas tank full to function at our optimum level. Your energy level is
  directly proportional to your gas tank. Josh has offered up some good advice
  for maintaining and boosting our energy levels. As a side note, his study
  program is pretty rigorous, so these recommendations should come in handy if
  you choose to pursue his program.


  Josh recommends we eat high-quality food, which seems a no-brainer. Are you
  eating high-quality foods? Do you scrutinize what you put into your body? Me
  either. For exercise he uses a fourteen-pound sledgehammer which I think is a
  great idea (see [www.shovelglove.com](http://www.shovelglove.com/)). In
  addition to food and exercise, Josh also discusses sleep and our need for 7 to
  8 hours of quality sleep a night. Another no-brainer, except few of us get the
  proper sleep. His solution: set an alarm as a reminder to go to bed. He goes
  on to recommend you get some direct non-filtered sunlight daily. About 10
  minutes in the morning is his advice. It works too. I’ve been doing this daily
  for the last couple of weeks and it’s amazing. Give it a try.


  To implement these recommendations takes willpower. The problem is, willpower
  depletes. Josh states that willpower is useful, but has limitations. One of
  these is tied to our reserves, and reserves are limited. He says the best way
  to use our reserves of willpower is to employ a Guiding Structure to change
  our environment instead of trying to alter or change our behavior. His example
  of ice cream is on point. Instead of trying to not eat ice cream, just stop
  buying it. In this way, we do not change our behavior, we alter our
  environment. We still want the ice cream, but there’s none available. We
  altered the structure of our environment in spite of our behavior and depleted
  willpower. Josh says: “Save your Willpower: focus on using it to change your
  Environment, and you’ll have more available to use whenever Inhibition is
  necessary” (pg 211). Where could you apply a Guiding Structure to circumvent
  your Willpower Depletion?

  Josh Kaufman’s _The Personal MBA_ is high on my “must read” list. This is
  fundamental business reading and will go a long way in helping you better
  understand the world of business. Josh speaks of the Growth Mind-set, and this
  book embraces everything that implies. What aspect of business fundamentals
  would you most like to better understand? _The Personal MBA: Master the Art of
  Business_ has you covered. As a solid foundational text on the fundamentals of
  business, this is an excellent volume.

> "Don’t worry if you’re a complete beginner. Unlike many other business books, this book does not require any prior business knowledge or experience." _\- The Personal MBA, page 3_

The majority of business books published today are topical in nature and content. They deal with a single discipline within the total business framework. This is great if you are looking to educate yourself in a specific body of knowledge or you are looking to increase your exposure to a given discipline. What if you want a total emersion in the main disciplines—an exposure to the total body of knowledge? What then? Josh Kaufman’s _The Personal MBA: Master the Art of Business_ provides us with the opportunity to review each of the main business disciplines in relationship to the whole of business. We can think of this book as a complete foundational introduction to the world of commerce.

Josh Kaufman’s _The Personal MBA_ is about pushing the curtain back on business and exposing what you can expect. Josh wrote this book for those new to business, but there are concepts in this book that any seasoned business person will find useful. Josh’s book and associated website: [www.personalmba.com](http://www.personalmba.com/) were started as a project to see if we could get a world-class business education by reading a carefully culled selection of business books. The history behind _The Personal MBA_ is a fascinating story and well documented in chapter one where he discusses how the project came about and developed.

The biggest obstacle to implementing a self-study reading plan is having a starting point and recommended reading list that expands on a foundation. That’s the value of Josh’s book. We get the foundation and a reading list that expands that foundation. _The Personal MBA_takes us through the hard and soft side of business. Since a sound vocabulary is important in understanding business principles and concepts, Josh has done us solid by introducing major principles and concepts that side-step jargon with clear and concise definitions and examples.
