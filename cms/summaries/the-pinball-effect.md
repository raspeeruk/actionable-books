  ### Our Greatest Teacher


  > "Being aware of change and how it operates is halfway to second-guessing it.
  And second-guessing change is good for survival and success in life."- The
  Pinball Effect, page 4


  Perhaps what makes _The Pinball Effect_ stand out from other “history” books
  is not so much the satisfying “click” of understanding that takes place when a
  new puzzle piece of history falls into place, but rather in how those puzzle
  pieces fit together to tell a story previously unimagined. As Burke marvels
  repeatedly through the book, there’s no way that the characters of the time
  could possibly have understood the eventual impact of their work. Only in
  hindsight can we see just how monumental their accomplishments were and, in
  such, we’re reminded of how history truly is our greatest teacher.


  In virtually all cases explored in _The Pinball Effect_ we can see two truths
  being confirmed: (1) that change is constant, and (2) that the individuals who
  leave their mark on history are those who capitalize on the changes of their
  era.

  ### Pepper Power


  > "Spices were so valuable that in the fifth century A.D., one Roman city
  under siege by barbarians bought them off with three thousand pounds of
  pepper."- The Pinball Effect, page 65


  It’s important to remind ourselves that just because something is valuable now
  doesn’t mean it always will be, and likewise, something seen as a household
  item today could be extremely valuable in the future.


  At one point in _The Pinball Effect_, Burke discusses _sugar_ being more
  expensive than gasoline today in comparable dollars. In the quote above, _a
  city_ was worth less than today’s equivalent of $3000 worth of black pepper.
  The lesson here is not (hopefully) that we should be investing in household
  spices. Instead, I believe there is real value on reflecting on the perception
  of value as it evolves through time. I would imagine that, a thousand years
  from now, historians will also shake their heads at how much value we placed
  on gasoline.


  It’s important to loosen our concern on immediate value and try to float our
  thoughts _forward_ in time to imagine what might be of value 10, 15 or 25
  years from now. What products or services currently demand a premium in your
  own industry? If you were to “disengage” from today and imagine forward a
  decade or two, can you imagine what might replace it?


  “The only thing constant is change”, as they say. We could all benefit from a
  little less weight on the present, and a little more on the future.
f_conclusion: >-
  James Burke’s _The Pinball Effect_ is not a book I would have naturally chosen
  for an Actionable Summary. After all, with a cataloguing classification of
  “History/Science”, it doesn’t even fit the base criteria of “Business Books
  made Actionable”. _The Pinball Effect_ **was** the community pick for December
  though, so I dedicated my time to reading it. And I can truly say that I
  sincerely enjoyed it. I think my favorite idea from the whole book came in the
  first few pages (the introduction, actually), where Burke speculates on the
  importance of experimentation (and inevitable failures) that leads to
  game-changing innovation. Keep in mind that _The Pinball Effect_ was first
  published in 1996, when you read this quote: _“Schools might train students to
  weave their own way idiosyncratically through the web, imagining their way to
  solutions, rather than learning by rote lists of data that will be obsolete
  before they can use them.”_

  "Sometimes the simplest act will have cosmic repercussions a hundred years
  later. On other occasions, the most cataclysmic events will finally lead to
  ordinary, even humdrum results."
