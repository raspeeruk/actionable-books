  ### Understand Your Plateaus


  > "Understanding why we reach a plateau can help us stop wasting time on
  things that we’ve stopped getting value from and focus on other things that
  leverage our time and energy better."- The Plateau Effect, prologue


  Whether it is the number of consecutive digits you can remember (for most
  people around 7) or you lose 10 pounds in the first week of a diet, but then
  very little after that, plateaus are everywhere. So, what causes them? We are
  biologically wired to ignore the familiar and focus on the unique. This trait
  paid dividends in helping us to spot predators or sudden changes in the
  environment but is less useful in our first world lives. We go through a
  process of acclimatization where prolonged exposure to something, whether it
  be the humidity or a particular way of thinking, stops us from noticing and
  eventually plateau.


  If you were doing something that wasn’t paying dividends, why would you
  continue to do it? We do all the time when we hit a plateau, we try to break
  through using the same methods that initially created the plateau. **Our
  natural response to plateaus is to work harder at what we’re currently
  doing.** The authors explain that the Plateau Effect is subject to the law of
  diminishing returns. Plateaus function as a type of growth quicksand, the
  harder you work applying your tried and true methods, the faster you’ll sink.
  **Understanding that you’ve hit a plateau can help you realize that you need
  to change something, and maybe even do something entirely different.**

  ### Don't Freeze


  > "Nothing keeps people unhappy, stuck, underemployed, frustrated, and
  struggling like the failure to imagine other potential outcomes—or, more
  directly, the failure to see the opportunity cost of standing still. That
  might be the very definition of a plateau."- The Plateau Effect, page 137


  You remember the idea of opportunity cost from economics? The idea that by
  choosing to write this summary tonight I am automatically choosing not to do
  an unlimited number of other things like the laundry or watching a movie.


  When we are faced with an unknown challenge we often think we have two
  options: fight or flight. Turns out we have another option: freeze. Freezing
  is unproductive whether you “are a deer being chased by a lion” or working “a
  dead-end job” expecting something to change. We plateau and then we freeze.
  **We continue to do what isn’t working, we work harder, we refuse to try
  something different.** Freezing won’t help us break through a plateau. Your
  first attempts to break through the plateau are not guaranteed to work, but
  freezing and continuing on with the status quo will never work.


  _“Breaking through plateaus… requires constant recalibration—it takes a little
  of this and a bit of that.”_


  Plateaus are not solved by one size fits all solutions but most of them are
  aided by embracing some sort of diversity. Furthermore, those that are solved
  are all solved with some form of action.


  I found while writing this summary that plateaus in our lives can be large and
  small. Not every plateau involves a dead-end job or an unhappy relationship.
  Plateaus can occur on small projects. Today, I wrote 4 different incarnations
  of Gem 2. I tried different ideas from the book in an attempt to have this
  summary mesh together. Each one seemed to make less sense than the last.
  Frustrated, I stopped writing, I froze.


  While I don’t have a cathartic ending to relate I can say that **plateaus can
  be temporary.** I came to realize after a short break that I had a few pages
  of notes I had overlooked and decided to write about those. **If we continue
  to “recalibrate” and try different things we can find ways through our
  plateaus.** It may take time and some frustration. The solutions may not be
  perfect, but they are better than freezing. As long as you continue to work
  and mix things up you will continue to grow.


  _Where you are stuck in your life and how you plan to mix things up to break
  through your plateaus?_

  ### Shake Things Up


  > "People, relationships, business, and even physical processes become immune
  to the same techniques, the same approaches, the same solutions. Immunity can
  be frustrating—what worked so well yesterday just won't work today."- The
  Plateau Effect, page 257


  We are biologically wired to plateau to things after prolonged exposure, we
  become immune. Therefore, we have work continually to improve. The authors
  suggest “shaking things up.” They say “trying different approaches,
  techniques, or procedures can shake you out of an immunity plateau.”


  You become immune to something that you continuously do or experience. Those
  great sunsets you thought you’d never get sick of seeing, you stop noticing
  them after daily exposure. However, you go on vacation for a few weeks and
  come back and your appreciation for that combination of colors is renewed.
  **Shaking things up can do more than just help you appreciate the
  landscapes.** Hit a plateau at work? Volunteer for a new project. Experiencing
  a stagnant phase with your spouse? Take a dance class together.


  Feeling stuck? **Try something unconventional, do something out of the
  ordinary, shake things up.**

_“You don’t have problems in your life. You have plateaus. Plateaus rob you of early successes. They make hard work worthless. They turn beginner’s luck into sophomore slumps. They can even make you look lazy, dumb, careless, or unloving. You aren’t any of these things. You’ve just been fighting an invisible enemy.”_

– The Plateau Effect, page 251

Here we are in late January. **For the first few weeks you rocked your new goals for 2014, you were unstoppable, the stars aligned, this was going to be your year.** Then almost inexplicably your momentum dropped. Determined not to lose such a streak you redoubled your efforts, working harder than ever. Alas, you saw no improvements, despite investing more time and energy than ever. Don’t feel bad, the universe isn’t trying to pick on you or single you out for a string of rotten luck. Bob Sullivan and Hugh Thompson, authors of _The Plateau Effect_, explain that your efforts, indeed all our efforts, have succumbed to what they term the plateau effect.

The authors explain that a plateau is simply a discontinuation of growth. You become accustomed to your surroundings, you are “dulled by sameness.” Many of the problems experienced can be traced to a plateau of some sort. Thankfully, it doesn’t have to be this way; **the solution to plateaus starts with understanding why we get stuck.**
