  ### Promotion Is a Leadership Skill


  > "If you are waiting for someone to promote you, you are wasting your time.
  It is essential to build your reputation across the organization. You need to
  promote yourself. You need to promote your team."- The Politics of Promotion,
  page 41


  Like many of the women Bonnie discusses, I too considered “politics” to be the
  equivalent of a four letter word. Only in recent years have I come to
  recognize how important it is, and that it not only helps you get ahead, but
  that it also can be used for the benefit of your team.


  As Bonnie points out, self-promotion and being politically savvy are
  leadership skills and need to be recognized as such. How else can a leader
  advocate for her team unless she is comfortable promoting her value and that
  of her team’s, and has the appropriate relationships and influence to be
  heard. All of this requires political savviness.


  And all of this starts by recognizing your—and your team’s—unique value
  proposition. In other words, what value do you and only you provide? Knowing
  this and being able to articulate it will help you network, attract sponsors,
  and get political influence.


  Bonnie gives an example of a COO who had a difficult relationship with her CEO
  until she realized that her ability to provide him detailed information helped
  him make decisions more quickly. Once she recognized this and started giving
  him status reports from this perspective, he appreciated her and her value to
  him much more, and their relationship improved drastically.

  ### Network Strategically


  > "To network effectively, you need to move out of your comfort zone and
  identify people who can help your career, not just those people you like.
  Strategic networking is more than socializing and swapping business cards:
  it’s creating solid relationships inside and outside the company to support
  your career aspirations. It takes focus and intention to build such a network,
  but it’s invaluable for your professional development."- The Politics of
  Promotion, page 107


  Unlike socializing, strategic networking is all about political influence. As
  Bonnie explains, many women look for mentors and sponsors in those they
  respect and want to emulate, but these people don’t always have enough power
  to help them (or their teams). Instead, you should try to establish an open
  network and look for people who can help you professionally.


  And since networking needs to be reciprocal, this is where knowing your unique
  value proposition and having the confidence to promote it will help. The same
  goes for acquiring a sponsor, something few women have but can make all the
  difference in getting ahead. Unlike a mentor who just advises, sponsors
  actually use their own political capital to help you advance. They do so
  because they believe in you and by aligning themselves with you, expect to
  broaden their network, influence, or access to information.

  ### Establish an Affirming Mindset


  > "A daily practice of journaling your successes can actually change your
  brain chemistry. It is possible to create new neural pathways that will reset
  your default thinking to be positive and self-affirming. "- The Politics of
  Promotion, page 65


  So you recognize that to become a leader, you have to promote yourself and
  your team. You even know your unique value proposition and its importance, but
  do you have the self-confidence to own it and share it? Or like many women, do
  you often doubt yourself?


  Bonnie shares what bestselling author Marci Shimoff explained during a guest
  interview. She called our mindset “Teflon” when it comes to praises—they won’t
  stick—but “Velcro” when it comes to self-doubt.


  How do we change this? Bonnie recommends keeping a daily journal of your
  successes. Not only can the act of writing them down help you become more
  positive, but when you review them at the end of the week and see the pattern
  of your accomplishments, it will make it easier to own it—and to promote it to
  others in your company.
f_conclusion: >-
  Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, whether you enjoy socializing or
  not, becoming more politically willing and savvy is essential to getting ahead
  professionally. It is not enough to just do well and work hard, you need to be
  sure that the right people know of your successes. You also then need to
  familiarize yourself with the unwritten rules of your culture and company,
  with who are the decision makers and influencers, and with who you need to
  connect with to get ahead. All this starts with being willing and just paying
  attention.
f_quote-2: >-
  "Workplaces are highly political environments where decisions about who gets
  ahead, who gets more compensation, and who gets access to scarce resources are
  not based on performance alone. Our naïve assumption that our performance will
  guarantee a successful career is a dangerous one. This assumption results in
  thousands of women being blindsided. And it happens every day."

Bonnie Marcus, author of _The Politics of Promotion: How High-Achieving Women Get Ahead and Stay Ahead_ and a former senior executive, has firsthand experience of what being blindsided feels like. That incident was a wake-up call for her and she has since become very politically savvy. To help other women achieve the same, she has written this book and shares with us the “tools” needed for success in this arena; these include:

1.  The “Mirror,” your tool to recognize your unique value proposition and to promote yourself;
2.  The “Magnifying Glass,” your tool to observe and learn all the written and unwritten rules of your company;
3.  The “Pass Go and Collect $200 Card,” your tool to improve your strategic networking;
4.  The “Get Out of Jail Card,” your tool to find and get a sponsor who will help promote you;
5.  The “GPS,” your tool to determine what type of executive coach you need and how to find one.

Whether you are an introvert or an extrovert, whether you enjoy socializing or not, becoming more politically willing and savvy is essential to getting ahead professionally.

You also then need to familiarize yourself with the unwritten rules of your culture and company, with who are the decision makers and influencers, and with who you need to connect with to get ahead. All this starts with being willing and just paying attention.

And although “politics” are necessary, they should not be perceived as negative or manipulative. To be a leader you need political influence and you can only get it by ensuring the right people are aware of what you and your team have to offer, which will lead to further resources, recognition, and opportunity for both you and them. From this perspective, politics can be viewed as a means to advocate for your team to ensure their success.

There’s also nothing wrong with advocating for yourself since unless you have a sponsor, who else will?

Do you consider yourself politically savvy? If not, what one action can you take right now to become more politically willing and savvy?
