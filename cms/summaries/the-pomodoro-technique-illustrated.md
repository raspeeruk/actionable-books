  ### Power Up Your Productivity


  > "With the Pomodoro Technique, you can make time your friend, not your enemy.
  Instead of feeling anxiety about deadlines for this hour, this day, this week
  or this month, you set a timer for twenty-five minutes and completely focus on
  the task at hand."- The Pomodoro Technique, section 1.4 (Kindle)


  **The main benefit of the Pomodoro Technique is to get more done.** By working
  in twenty-five minute units of focused time (each unit is known as one
  Pomodoro) you will create powerful results for your productivity. By focusing
  on one activity at a time, you could halve the amount of time each activity
  would otherwise take.


  The reason this works so well is that our brains need to work in a number of
  different modes: big picture planning, being absorbed in a task and
  relaxation/recreation. **When we pick a task to work on for twenty-five
  minutes we can focus exclusively on that task and experience the state of
  flow.** Knowing that this work period will come to an end is what allows us to
  lose sight of the bigger picture for the time being.


  Once the Pomodoro ends, you take a break. This is very important. **Taking a
  break helps to create a sense of perspective and gives you an opportunity to
  decide whether to keep working on this task.** Before your next Pomodoro, you
  might check your email and phone messages to see whether anything more urgent
  or important has come up.

  ### Prove Your Performance


  > "Tracking data can answer questions about the way you work and help you
  improve your productivity."- The Pomodoro Technique, section 3.20 (Kindle)


  **Things that get tracked get done.** Another key to the Pomodoro Technique is
  tracking.


  Important metrics include:


  *   How many Pomodori do you complete in a day?

  *   How many times do you get interrupted?

  *   How many Pomodori do regular activities take?


  I’ve been using this technique for the past seven working days. The average
  number of Pomodori I complete in a day is four. Though I know that’s not all
  the work I do, I was still surprised by the low number of sessions that I’ve
  had that are truly focused work.


  **The best day I’ve had so far is six.** However, six Pomodoro is extremely
  rewarding. During this time I’ve made significant progress in drafting updates
  for my website and writing client proposals. By tracking the number of
  Pomodori you complete in a day, you can see why and how you’re getting your
  work done or, alternatively, give you an insight into why it’s so hard to move
  some tasks and goals forward.


  In order to effectively track the number of Pomodori, you must choose a
  consistent length of time. The recommended time is twenty-five minutes.
  However you could choose a shorter or longer time if you prefer, as long as
  it’s the same amount each time. Choosing a consistent length means you can
  compare a day of work to another easily – five Pomodoro completed on Wednesday
  can be compared quickly with eight on Thursday.


  **How often are you interrupted?** So far, all of my Pomodori have been in my
  home office. Interruptions are thankfully rare – usually I have one or none.
  Distractions can either be external (interrupted by the outside environment or
  other people) or internal (my own thoughts or actions). I find most of my
  distractions are internal – I think of something else I could be doing. One
  time I made breakfast and tried to eat it while typing this summary. It
  doesn’t work. I can either type or eat, not both. Of course, I can switch back
  and forth between the activities but it’s very inefficient. I’ve switched
  between eating and typing before but only now that I am focused on getting
  work done during a Pomodoro, I notice how ineffective it is.


  How many Pomodori do regular tasks take? I’ve learned how long it takes me to
  write a summary for Actionable Books. This summary took me four Pomodori,
  which is what I estimated. I’ve now set myself a benchmark for future
  summaries. Recently I estimated it would take me two Pomodoro to write a
  proposal for a client. In reality, it took four. This data will help me plan
  my time better in future.


  Through using the Pomodoro Technique, I am making progress on tasks that have
  languished on my list for far too long. The key of this concept for me is
  blocking off time in my day for focused work.


  How much time do you spend per day engaged in focused work? What does this
  amount of time tell you about your productivity?

  ### Protect Your Pomodoro


  > "The mental state, characterized by the following properties, is known as
  flow: clear goals, concentration and focus, a loss of the feeling of
  self-consciousness...\[ \] balance between ability level and challenge,
  intrinsically rewarding, the merging of action and awareness."- The Pomodoro
  Technique, section 2.17 (Kindle)


  A key principle of the Pomodoro Technique is to **ignore distractions and
  minimize interruptions**, to allow you to truly focus and lose yourself in the
  activity at hand. Here’s how I do it. I decide on the work I’m going to do and
  get my materials ready. For example, I might open relevant web pages and
  collect my notes and tools.


  When I’m ready to start, I follow these steps:


  1\. Close email program and turn off the sound on phone  

  2\. Set timer for twenty-five minutes (it’s important that it will make a
  noise when the time is up)  

  3\. Start working  

  4\. Stop at the end (I’ll finish the sentence I was writing or make a note to
  remind myself of where I was at when the timer went)

> "Who doesn’t want to have a stress-free life? To have brilliant ideas? To improve? To enjoy free time? But how can we achieve these goals?" _\- The Pomodoro Technique, foreword_

_The Pomodoro Technique Illustrated_ by Staffan Nöteberg is based on the Pomodoro Technique, created by Francesco Cirillo as a way to boost his own productivity. **The essence of it is to work on one activity at a time, for twenty-five minutes, while avoiding distractions.** Pomodoro is the Italian word for tomato. The technique is named because of tomato-shaped kitchen timers often used for measuring a twenty-five minute session.

This short and easy read covers the following information about the technique:

*   What the technique is
*   Why it works so well with the natural processes of our brains
*   How it works in detail
*   What interruptions we face and how to deal with them
*   How to adapt the technique to your own use
*   When and where the technique might work, for example, while working with others

The book describes the productivity technique and explains how it can work well with bigger picture productivity systems such as [_Getting Things Done_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/getting-things-done/).
