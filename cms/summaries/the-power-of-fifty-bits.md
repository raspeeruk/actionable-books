  ### Guard Those Fifty Bits


  > "The fact of the matter is that we tend to focus our attention on things
  that are either pressing or pleasurable."- The Power of Fifty Bits, page 3


  Why do humans have such a short attention span? According to Nease, our brains
  process an average of ten million bits of information per second, but the
  conscious section of our brains can only handle fifty bits per second. So, if
  we can only focus on fifty bits at a time, then we naturally concentrate on
  the most pressing and pleasurable aspects. As the most energy-intensive organ,
  the brain depends on shortcuts to save energy and to “get the job done as
  efficiently as possible without engaging our scarce fifty bits.”


  The author also discusses several shortcuts that are part of our natural
  inclinations and help explain our predisposition to only paying attention to
  whatever is in front of us. The first shortcut, loss aversion, states that
  humans are wired to avoid losses. Therefore, we will put in more effort to
  avoid losses than to pursue gains.


  The pursuit of instant gratification is a second mental shortcut that Nease
  believes is built-into into our consciousness. Known as hyperbolic
  discounting, the main premise is that people are less willing to wait for
  gains in the future vs. the present. In other words, “actions that lead to
  future benefits but have up-front costs will seem attractive when we plan to
  engage in them, but less attractive when it comes time to implement them.”
  Exercise is the perfect example of an activity requiring effort now but the
  benefits occur in the future.


  So how does all this insight into our internal mapping help us in directing
  our behavior towards the actions we want to take? We can begin by improving
  the ease of following through on a preferred action.

  ### Reframing Choices Using Loss Aversion


  > "Reframing can be a very effective and powerful method for increasing the
  rate at which people engage in desirable behaviors and make choices that will
  serve them well over the longer term."- The Power of Fifty Bits, page 117


  Framing your message in a way that gets your point across can be the key
  difference in someone following through or not on something you want them to
  do. Nease believes that frames are effective precisely because they “provide
  cues to help us know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.”


  He gives an example of this from his experience at Express Scripts, combining
  people’s aversion for losses with the strategic use of framing. Patients were
  convinced to switch to lower-cost generic medication from more expensive
  brands. This was done by focusing the communication on how much money they
  were losing when more expensive brands were purchased and used the term
  “burning money” to highlight the losses incurred. Frames make some conclusions
  easier or more attractive than others.

  ### Make It Easy If You Want It Done


  > "Most good behaviors that are difficult involve an upfront cost for a future
  benefit."- The Power of Fifty Bits, page 135


  Given that humans are wired for impatience, removing any obstacle to a desired
  behavior greatly increases the chances of following through. Nease refers to
  these obstacles as the “here and now hassles” associated with a particular
  behavior and uses the example of a company streamlining their 401(k)
  participation rate. All the employees had to do to sign up was check a box on
  a postcard and return it. That simple, seamless step increased participation
  rates by 15 percent.


  Another tactic to increase the ease and likelihood of doing something is the
  use of fluency. Fluency refers to the “ease with which our brains process
  incoming information.” If a statement is seen as fluent, we are more likely to
  agree with it, like it and consider it easier to do. The less fluency people
  have to use to process a piece of information, the fewer of their fifty bits
  they engage.


  How do we increase fluency? One way is to use easier-to-read fonts. The names
  we give to things can also affect fluency. Nease illustrates this principle
  with the following example: companies with easy-to-pronounce names perform
  better on their first day as a public company than companies with names that
  are difficult to pronounce.

  Another aspect of framing that is deemed helpful is bundling vs. enumerating.
  This is especially helpful with financial costs and incentives. When dealing
  with losses, it is often better to group or bundle the loss in one large
  amount. Gains on the other hand, are often undervalued and when enumerated or
  itemized, emphasize the specific benefits.

> “Today’s world demands deeper attention and more frequent decision making, but our brains are instead wired for inattention and inertia. These limitations lead to a persistent gap between our internal intentions and our outward actions.” _\- The Power of Fifty Bits, page 156_

Most people have good intentions but still keep making bad choices. Although they’re well aware of the health benefits of exercising and eating well, they skip workouts and eat too much junk food. Bob Nease addresses this intent/behavior gap in, _The Power of Fifty Bits: The New Science of Turning Good Intentions into Positive Results,_ his well-researched book on changing human behavior.

As a chief scientist at Express Scripts, Nease was responsible for nudging patients towards making better choices. In the process, he developed practical strategies that were effective in closing the gap between our goals and actual behaviors.

In the book, Nease describes a set of principles that capitalize on our existing good intentions to improve the quality of our choices. It’s a blueprint to close that gap between what you want to achieve and what you actually accomplish. To close that gap, a basic understanding of how we’re wired is helpful.

A key takeaway from this great book is to activate the good intentions we already have and to capitalize on reengineering our environment to work with our brain’s natural biological biases rather than against it. Have you removed all the obstacles standing in your way?
