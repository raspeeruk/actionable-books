  ### The Importance of Renewal


  > "The longer, more continuously, and later at night you work, the less
  efficient and more mistake-prone you become."- The Power of Full Engagement,
  page 56


  Whoa, back up. We’re not going to work into the night anymore? How am I
  supposed to keep up with the stuff I need to do?


  _The Power of Full Engagement_ highlights a series of studies revealing that
  shift workers who work nights have twice the number of highway accidents as
  day workers and considerably more on-the-job accidents as well. While I’m
  almost certain that the decreased visibility at night is at least partially
  responsible for the increased number of highway accidents, I can hardly find a
  cause unrelated to fatigue that plays a part in the accidents that happened on
  the job.


  Next time you’re working on that project, try not to work on the crucial parts
  late into the night. Or, take a nap/break and continue once you have been
  refreshed. Winston Churchill took an hour’s nap every day when he was leading
  Britain in the war. Here’s a more modern example of what happens when you
  don’t rest enough:


  “To his surprise and frustration, his efforts were proving counterproductive.
  Longer hours and more intense commitment weren’t translating into more
  creative output…Given the firm’s exceptional earlier success, it was clear
  that the problem wasn’t a lack of talent or skill – either in Jake’s case or
  more broadly in the organization. It struck us that he was effectively trying
  too hard – pushing himself relentlessly to be more creative and productive,
  and doing the same to his staff. We suggested to Jake that he was spending too
  much mental energy without sufficient recovery, and that the answer might be
  to build in more down time to think in different ways, and to allow ideas to
  percolate” (page 98).


  This finding is also mentioned by Jonah Lehrer, neuroscientist and author, who
  was recently talking about creativity with
  [Stephen](http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/tue-april-17-2012-jonah-lehrer)
  [Colbert](http://www.colbertnation.com/full-episodes/tue-april-17-2012-jonah-lehrer).
  He explained that the majority of people don’t make enough time to be
  creative. Less work can lead to increased results, especially in this niche
  (don’t sneer, this is what the Pareto Principle – aka the “80/20 Rule” – is
  based on).


  As the authors note: “It is not the intensity of energy expenditure that
  produces burnout, impaired performance and physical breakdown, but rather the
  duration of expenditure without recovery” (page 41).


  Okay, so you get the point: Rest is important. How do we ensure that we are
  functioning at full mental capacity?

  ### 20-35 minutes of exercise, 3-5 times per week


  > "Because mind and body are so inextricably connected, even moderate physical
  exercise can increase cognitive capacity. It does so most simply by driving
  more blood and oxygen to the brain."- The Power of Full Engagement, page 101


  The mind’s abilities excel when it has more fuel. In this case, then,
  exercising doesn’t just function as an improvement to the body, but also
  serves to improve your cognitive abilities.


  The following highlights just how crucial exercise is: “A research team at the
  University of Illinois set out to test the cognitive functioning of 124 women
  ages sixty to seventy-five who never or rarely exercised. The women were put
  on a three-day-a-week program that included either a brisk one-hour walk or an
  hour of gentle yoga-style stretching. In effect the exercisers were asked to
  push past their comfort zones physically, while the stretchers were not. After
  just six months, the walkers demonstrated 25 percent higher scores than the
  stretchers on a series of key cognitive tests” (page 101).


  You don’t have to be an aspiring bodybuilder to take advantage of this
  mindhack: just simply start immersing yourself in more than 30 minutes of
  continuous exercise that challenges you (usually around 65% – 80% of max heart
  interval, but everyone’s different – and Actionable Books is not responsible
  for any adverse effects), 3-5 times per week.


  The result is that you’ll have more energy when you wake up in the morning
  (which will sustain itself throughout the day), and you’ll be more present in
  both your personal and professional life.


  Engagement means a more fulfilling life, and earning the ability to enjoy each
  moment. It means seizing the power of renewal, and re-igniting our physical
  bodies. Don’t just manage your time; manage your **energy**. _The Power of
  Full Engagement_ will show you how.

  ### Recovery Rituals


  > "Each time Ivan Lendl stepped up to the line to serve during a tennis match,
  he predictably wiped his brow with his wristband, knocked the head of his
  racquet against each of his heels, took sawdust from his pocket, bounced the
  ball four times and visualized where he intended to hit the ball. In the
  process, Lendl was recalibrating his energy: pushing away distraction, calming
  his physiology, focusing his attention, triggering reengagement and preparing
  his body to perform at its best. In effect, he was programming his internal
  computer. When the point began, the program ran automatically."- The Power of
  Full Engagement, page 172


  Similarly, _The Power of Full Engagement_ highlights examples of things people
  like to do during breaks. Some people typically do yoga in their office, but
  the activities range drastically. Jake (from two quotes ago) painted for two
  hours in the morning a couple of times per week. Others walk downstairs and go
  get their shoes shined (literally, at a shop) and chat with friends in twenty
  minute increments.


  What hobbies do you take great pleasure in, and how can you integrate them
  into your life? Take around a 15-20 minute break every 90-120 minutes, and
  make sure you are getting the renewal that you need.

_The Power of Full Engagement_ by Tony Schwartz and Jim Loehr isn’t the first book on budgeting time and energy, and it won’t be the last. But it’s arguably one of the most important. We all have a growing number of things we want (or need) to try out. It could be that new project at work, or dance lessons, or that class you’re trying to ace. As co-author, Tony Schwartz, illustrates in an [interview](http://www.jonathanfields.com/blog/reinventing-work-with-tony-schwartz/), time is not the best way to deal with this; time is finite. Comparatively, energy capacity can be expanded; you can add to your energy, and you can also restore and renew your energy.

_The Power of Full Engagement_ centres around the athlete metaphor: in order to achieve high performance in our lives, we must constantly seek incremental improvements, and push beyond our normal limits by training in the systematic way that athletes do (reminiscent of the idea of deliberate practice originally posited by Geoff Calvin in [_Talent is Overrated_](http://www.geoffcolvin.com/books/)).

Additionally, _The Power of Full Engagement_ also reinforces the point of recovery and **renewal** and the essential role they both play in increasing energy capacity. That’s something we don’t hear every day.
