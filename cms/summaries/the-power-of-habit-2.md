  ### Small Wins


  > "Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny advantages into
  patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are within reach."- The
  Power of Habit, page 112


  When a new leader took over aluminum company ALCOA’s reigns, he chose to focus
  purely on workplace safety. (Shareholders freaked.) “O’Neill never promised
  that his focus on worker safety would increase Alcoa’s profits. However, as
  his new routines moved through the organization, costs came down, quality went
  up, and productivity skyrocketed” (page 108).


  As O’Neill started making ALCOA safer, he also made it more productive, less
  wasteful, and more profitable. Each safety measure ended up helping the bottom
  line in some way. Safety was a habit that bled over to every other habit; a
  ton of tactics used to increase safety (like shorter feedback loops, safer
  machinery, and an employee suggestion system) eventually helped ALCOA rise to
  the top of their industry.


  This phenomenon expands beyond the corporation. Physical exercise spills over
  into our lives. Once we start exercising, we start eating healthier and become
  more productive at work — two benefits we don’t usually correlate with going
  to the gym.

  ### Creating Belief and Conviction


  > "Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started
  spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they
  could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a
  permanent behavior."- The Power of Habit, page 85


  Scoff as you may: genuine belief has consistently been the difference between
  successfully creating a good habit or crushing a bad one, and failure to do
  so. Belief can be created through many vehicles, and _The Power of Habit_
  highlights some that have worked in the past.


  **Tragedy:** This is the story of how the Indianapolis Colts began to adopt
  their coach Tony Dungy’s style and strategies. It began with the death of his
  son.


  “Dungy has always said that nothing is more important to him than his family.
  But in the wake of Jamie’s passing, as the Colts started preparing for the
  next season, something shifted, his players say. The team gave in to Dungy’s
  vision of how football should be played in a way they hadn’t before. They
  started to believe” (page 87). Instead of worrying about contracts or
  salaries, players were compelled to play according to coach’s strategy. The
  Colts won the Super Bowl that year.


  **Religion:** Similarly, a spiritual or supernatural experience can create the
  belief or conviction required to endure through tough times. “Bill Wilson
  stopped drinking when he found religion and cried out to God (and apparently
  received a vision). Then he went on to found Alcoholics Anonymous and didn’t
  have another drink.”


  Bill Wilson is not the only person who has succeeded as a result of religion:
  “However, those alcoholics who believed, like John in Brooklyn, that some
  higher power had entered their lives were more likely to make it through the
  stressful periods with their sobriety intact” (page 84).


  Changing beliefs often don’t require tragedy or religion. Even changing social
  groups (page 88) and environment can have their own effect on belief and
  conviction. Belief is the element that will hold you to building your habit
  when things seem darkest.

  Charles Duhigg’s _The Power of Habit_ is an invaluable tome if you’re
  interested in breaking the habits that are holding you back.
