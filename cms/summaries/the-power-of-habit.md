  ### Small habits make or break you


  > "What Bowman could give Phelps, however – what would set him apart from
  other competitors- were habits that would make him the strongest mental
  swimmer in the pool."- The Power of Habit, page 111


  Don’t think you have it in you to change your bad habits? You will likely be
  thrilled to know that there is tremendous research that shows it is the small
  habits that fuel transformative changes. Each small habit creates a small
  advantage which sets in motion another small habit and advantage etc. The
  small habits create patterns that convince people that bigger achievements are
  within reach. Duhigg shares the story of how it was small habits that led to
  Michael Phelp’s Olympic gold medal victory. Michael’s small habits allowed him
  to wake up the morning of the meet and not really think at all. He stayed
  relaxed and simply followed his habits, one at a time, to victory.

  ### Habits can be learned and unlearned in four steps


  > "Habits – even once they are rooted in our minds – aren’t destiny. We can
  choose our habits, once we know how."- The Power of Habit, page 270


  While Duhigg admits that change might not be fast and it certainly isn’t easy,
  he believes that with time and effort, almost any habit can be reshaped.
  Habits can not be eradicated but they can be replaced. His **Golden Rule of
  Habit** is to keep the same cue and same reward but replace the routine.


  He offers 4 steps to do that:


  1) **Identify the routine.** Is it for example going to Starbucks each
  afternoon for a tea and cookie?


  2) **Experiment with different rewards.** Rewards satisfy cravings. But the
  tricky part is that we are often not conscious of the cravings that drive our
  behaviours. Interesting! So is the reward of the cookie and tea really the
  sugar burst or is it the energy of the location, the change of pace? How do
  you figure it out? Adjust the reward. For example, instead of the cookie and
  tea at Starbucks, try socializing for ten minutes, or go to Starbucks but eat
  an apple on the way and then just have the tea, or go for a brisk walk for ten
  minutes. That way you can figure out if you are really craving the cookie and
  tea at Starbucks or are just looking for an energy boost. Which new activity
  will satisfy the craving?


  3) **Isolate the cue.** What are you thinking the moment you decide to go to
  Starbucks? If you keep track of this over a few days, you will identify what
  is triggering the urge.


  4) **Have a plan.** Decide exactly what you will do when the craving hits then
  follow your plan.

  ### Identify the cost of craving and the rest will follow


  > "This is how new habits are created: by putting together a cue, a routine
  and a reward, and then cultivating a craving that drives the loop."- The Power
  of Habit, page 49


  The key element is the craving. Marketers at Proctor & Gamble studied videos
  of people making their beds. Why? They were trying desperately to figure out
  how to sell Febreeze; a product which seemed to have such tremendous benefits
  but was on track to be the biggest flop in company history. Suddenly, one of
  the researchers detected a subtle yet important pattern. People are rewarded
  by the smell of a clean room. They made some adjustments to their marketing
  and Febreeze went on to earn a billion dollars a year.


  Why do you brush your teeth every day? Before Claude Hopkins created tooth
  brushing habits, no one brushed their teeth. In fact, so many recruits for WWI
  had rotting teeth, officials said poor dental hygiene was a national security
  risk! How did Hopkins change this? He created a craving. You know that
  tingling feeling your mouth gets right after you brush your teeth? When you
  wake in the morning, you can’t wait to get that feeling. Funny thing, that
  tingling feeling is not necessary to have clean teeth! But we associate it as
  the reward for clean teeth and thus are inspired to clean our teeth! His
  toothpaste, Pepsodent, changed oral hygiene.


  What cravings can you create to change habits?
f_conclusion: >-
  Habits create our destiny. Too often, people don’t live the way they want – or
  eat or sleep or exercise or parent or work – the way they know they should,
  because of habits. With _The Power of Habit_, Charles Duhigg empowers us to
  know we can change those habits. And once we know habits can be changed, we
  have the freedom of choice again.

When you woke this morning, what was the first thing you did? What habits helped or hindered you? Now think about what habits help or hinder your organization and your community.

Charles Duhigg investigates how habits form, how to build new habits and how to change old ones in his engaging book _The Power of Habit_. To address all areas of your life, he divides the book into 3 sections starting closest to home with ‘you’. He moves to the broader world of organizations and finally to societies.

Habits are not easy to understand but by drawing on hundreds of academic studies, interviews with over three hundred scientists and executives and research conducted at dozens of companies, Duhigg empowers us by illustrating why habits exist and how you can change them.
