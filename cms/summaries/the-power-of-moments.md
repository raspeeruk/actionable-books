  ### We Can Create Defining Moments


  > "We can be the designers of moments that deliver elevation and insight and
  pride and connection. These extraordinary minutes and hours and days—they are
  what make life meaningful. And they are ours to create."- The Power of
  Moments, page 266


  Defining moments stand out, they influence us, cause us to rethink our
  direction, re-shape the trajectory of our lives. Many, but not all, of the
  moments we remember are ones the authors call “flagship moments”—the peaks,
  the pits, and the transitions.


  The big idea that the authors put forth in this book is that we can engineer
  these moments—or at least create the conditions for them to emerge. If we were
  to be more mindful in the way we thought about and created “defining moments,”
  our lives and the lives of those we work and live with could be richer, more
  meaningful, and more engaged.


  The authors propose four elements that create defining moments. A defining
  moment must include at least one of these elements—it does not have to include
  all four.


  These four elements are:


  **Elevation**: They rise above the everyday.  

  **Insight**: They rewire the way we understand ourselves—or the world.  

  **Pride**: They are moments that find us at our best—in terms of achievement
  or courage.  

  **Connection**: They are social—we share them with others.


  To create more and more powerful defining moments, we need to become
  “moment-spotters”—learn to spot occasions to invest in. Our focus on goals can
  blind us to the possibility of a given moment—even as moments can support the
  achievement of goals. (Although the authors emphasize that moments are an end
  in and of themselves—they do not have to support a goal to have value.)


  Creating defining moments often requires us to do, think, say, and be things
  that might seem bigger and less practical than normal. The authors talk about
  rejecting the “soul-sucking force of reasonableness” when we design memorable
  moments. We may need to spend more time, money or attention to create a
  memorable moment than seems “logical.”


  I’ll now share just two of the many insights the authors provide for creating
  each of these elements—specifically related to creating pride. Both can be
  applied as easily to individual as team or organizational pursuits.

  ### Practice Courage


  > "From historic protests to everyday acts, from the civil rights movement to
  an employee asking a tough question, this is the lesson we’ve learned: It is
  hard to be courageous, but it’s easier when you’ve practiced, and when you
  stand up, others will join you."- The Power of Moments, page 192


  Courage, the Heath brothers argue, is not (only) something that shows up, in a
  moment. We can multiply moments of courage by practicing in advance—so we know
  what to do in the moment.


  The authors remind us of Peter Gollwitzer’s “implementation intentions.” (One
  of my favorite tools of all time.) If we pre-load a plan by having a strategy
  that says: “If I am asked if I want a second drink, I will ask for sparkling
  water,” we are far less likely to break our resolve to drink more than we
  intended, because we’ll have a plan, on hand, for how to act in the moment.
  This seemingly small and personal example, can lead to smaller and larger acts
  of courage.


  Did you know that the people who participated with now Congressman John Lewis
  in the lunch-counter sit-ins that took place in 1960 in Nashville demanding
  desegregation, now a classic example of non-violent protest, were practiced in
  advance? Makeshift lunch counters were created, and the participants practiced
  responding to the types of reactions they might face in the moment.


  Similarly, how about, rather than talking _about_ how we might respond when
  ethically challenged (e.g., someone makes a racist joke in our presence, a
  colleague says or does something unethical,) we practice what we would say.
  Pre-loading our responses can be the difference between doing nothing because
  we’re at a loss for words or actions and creating a moment of real courage.


  We also learn that courage is contagious—when one person speaks up, others
  follow. So, start practicing.

  ### Multiply Milestones


  > "Success comes from pushing to the finish line. What milestones do is compel
  us to make that push, because (a) they’re within our grasp, and (b) we’ve
  chosen them precisely because they’re worth reaching for. Milestones define
  moments that are conquerable and worth conquering."- The Power of Moments,
  page 176


  The authors argue that, too often, we take a goal and add supporting plans,
  and we expect that to be enough to get us to where we need to go. The problem?
  That’s an accountability strategy but not a motivational one. It doesn’t
  change or improve our experience when we are working towards this goal. And it
  doesn’t, in the construct that the authors work with, deliver on the element
  of Pride.


  If we were, instead, to do what the authors describe as “leveling up”—we’d
  take a goal we were working on and ask ourselves, “what’s intrinsically
  motivating?” We’d come up with different things that we could achieve (and
  celebrate) on the way to the goal we were working towards. Some of these might
  be linear, and some not. Think of these like boy scout badges—they celebrate
  the journey and are inherently valuable and motivating to achieve. They also
  build pride.


  The authors especially recommend applying strategy at home, when we have full
  control of how we plan to reach our goals. Rather than “lose 10 pounds in 2
  months”—really take that apart and create a set of fun, achievable and
  motivational milestones. How can we create multiple “finish lines”?


  This strategy is embedded in many of the apps we use. I have come to
  appreciate Fitbit’s reminders about where I am in my quest for 10,000
  steps—and to appreciate the texts I get throughout the day—not too many to be
  annoying but enough to remind me of what I’m trying to achieve.


  Stepping back and creating these milestones, rather than simply pursuing goals
  and supporting steps, can turn something mundane into something more memorable
  and engaging.

  I encourage you to read the book and find your own favorite strategy—as well
  as inspiration in the many stories the authors share.

> “Defining moments shape our lives, but we don’t have to wait for them to happen. We can be the authors of them.” _\- The Power of Moments, page 5_

_The Power of Moments_ is the Heath brothers’ fourth book—their first in a little over four years. Like their prior books, it is a combination of easy to grasp (and remember) frameworks combined with often surprising and counterintuitive findings, brought to life with terrific storytelling. They are uniquely talented at bringing academic studies to life—their own and the ones that they reference.

Another feature of all prior Heath brother books—and of this one—is that they are highly actionable. It’s easy to apply the insights and strategies both at work and at home—as a boss, an employee, or a parent.
