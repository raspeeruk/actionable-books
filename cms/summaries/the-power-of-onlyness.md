  ### Defining Your Onlyness


  > "…the journey that leads you to yourself doesn’t require knowing exactly
  where you’re going or a map outlining precisely how to get there."- The Power
  of Onlyness, page 58


  It’s very likely that the path to defining—and realizing—your onlyness will be
  messy. It will probably leave you feeling vulnerable, and perhaps even scared.
  That’s invariably part of the process. As Merchant reminds us, “discovering
  purpose is exploratory and therefore leaves you especially vulnerable.”


  Merchant says that there are three “skills that will enable you to discover
  your purpose”. They are:


  1.  **Notice** – Become conscious of “what it is that you are drawn to, what
  matters to you.”

  2.  **Act big** – “Don’t just _be_ you, _do_ you_._”

  3.  **Act small** – “Don’t give a damn what others think.” This forces you to
  tackle and vanquish fear head on.


  In the Insights below we’ll explore how questions (a component of noticing)
  are often the first step to defining your onlyness, and then how to take
  action.

  ### Don’t Waste Time Navel-Gazing


  > "Devote the greater part of time and energy to action, because that’s when
  you discover what you care about, \[and identify and\] meet the people who can
  help you, to form the \[basis\] to be successful in the new thing."- Herminia
  Ibarra, quoted in The Power of Onlyness, page 67


  For those of you who aren’t familiar with the term, Dictionary.com defines
  navel-gazing as _“self-indulgent or excessive contemplation of oneself or a
  single issue, at the expense of a wider view.”_ We’ve all been reminded of the
  importance of introspection time and again. It is a valuable tool, but too
  much of it, especially in the context of realizing our onlyness, can be
  detrimental to action. When we’re naval-grazing we’re remaining firmly within
  the bounds of our comfort zone; we don’t learn anything and we don’t grow. As
  Merchant points out, “if you navel- gaze at the beginning, you won’t have any
  new information to parse, and your existing tribe will likely tell you, ‘That
  idea is _too_ weird, _too_ wild.’ Because for them, it is.”


  If you need more impetus to get going, consider this sobering fact, and
  perhaps file it away for future reference: “powerful people actually take more
  action than those less powerful.”

  ### The Power of Questions


  > "It’s when you encounter such questions—ones that you can’t answer, but
  can’t stop thinking about—that you also have the first clue to discovering
  what matters to you."- The Power of Onlyness, page 59


  What’s the one question that’s keeping you up at night? That persecutes you
  throughout the day, and weasels itself into your mind at the most inconvenient
  times and doesn’t give you a moment’s peace? It’s highly likely that annoying
  question is the key to unlocking your onlyness.


  That one question might seem highly unusual, and if it does, all the better.
  It means you’re onto something. André Delbecq wanted to explore spirituality
  in business, especially in terms of leadership. He was repeatedly told that
  “faith and fortune don’t mix”, but pursued his ambition anyway, and ultimately
  found his co-denters (those individuals who believe in your onlyness and will
  help you you achieve it). But isolating the question is just the beginning.
  “Give yourself permission to pursue the question you have, even if others
  might view it as a bit nuts,” Merchant advises. “Then, do the necessary work,
  even if you don’t know exactly how it will turn out. It’s in the _process_ of
  doing that work that you become ready to make a dent.”


  But what do I do, you might be asking yourself, if I don’t have a question
  that’s tormenting me night and day? Not all of us have that one question we
  can identify right now, and it’s very likely that it may come in time. As
  Merchant explains, often “it could be that your dent right now isn’t a thing
  to _do_, but a way to _be_, perhaps to find onlyness in people around you and
  help them to make their dent.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Nilofer Merchant’s _The Power of Onlyness_ is a powerful reminder to each of
  us that, regardless of our position in the hierarchy, we all have the
  potential to make a dent in the world if we just take the time to harness our
  onlyness. I’d like to give the last word to the great Martha Graham, who
  Merchant quotes in the text: “There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a
  quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is
  only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block
  it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The
  world will not have it.”

  "Through the power of onlyness, an individual conceives an idea born of his
  narrative, nurtures it with the help of a community that embraces it, and,
  through shared action, makes the idea powerful enough to dent the world."

> "Through the power of onlyness, an individual conceives an idea born of his narrative, nurtures it with the help of a community that embraces it, and, through shared action, makes the idea powerful enough to dent the world." _\- The Power of Onlyness, page 3_

In her first two books, Nilofer Merchant taught us how to “create business solutions through collaborative strategy” ([_The New How_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/the-new-how/)) and shared the _11 Rules for Creating Value in the Social Era_. Now she’s back with a new tome, _The Power of Onlyness: Make Your Wild Ideas Mighty Enough to Dent the World_, where she’s striving to help us all discover our purpose and leave our unique imprint on the world.

“I had often wondered whether anyone could actually be eligible to have a shot at success, or whether people had to fit a particular profile to have their ideas be valued,” Merchant writes. “The tension between those two alternatives had profound effects in my own life, so let me share three stories of how I discovered my own onlyness.”

This summary focuses on how you can begin to define your onlyness for yourself, and then proceed to act on it.
