  ### Build trust with body language


  > "Nearly everyone struggles with nervousness, anxiety, and insecurity in
  high-pressure situations where we care deeply about the outcome. It happens to
  even the most successful and dynamic communicators."- The Power of Presence,
  page 54


  Body language plays a big part in the opinions others form about us. Feeling
  nervous is normal. Unfortunately, when our thoughts focus on that feeling, and
  we start thinking about potential or previous mistakes, and imagine others
  have disapproving thoughts about us our body language conveys those feelings.
  Our thoughts become negative, and our actions communicate mistrust, people
  perceive us as unpleasant, and we fail to make a connection. We may not be
  able to stop feeling anxiety and insecurity, but with some practice and
  preparation we can stop letting those feelings unfavorably impact our
  presence.


  We have a physical reaction to stress—our heart pounds, we sweat, our
  breathing changes. It is difficult to experience those physical changes
  without riding the emotional rollercoaster. Before an important event, start a
  positive internal dialog about things you have done well. Think about things
  for which you are grateful. Listen to upbeat music. Take deep breaths and slow
  down your speech. Ask other people questions to take the focus off of
  yourself. Acknowledge your fear and physical reaction. Accept it as a feeling
  separate from who you are and the outcome of this situation. Our sense of how
  well we are doing under stress is biased, and others are often more approving
  than we believe. However, they will notice our discomfort. If we practice
  controlling our reaction, it will improve our presence and others will feel
  more comfortable and connected.


  Be intentional and mindful of body language even in comfortable settings. I
  have a habit of twisting my hair and moving more than most people. I am not
  anxious; these actions are part of my normal behavior when I am alone or with
  other people. However, other people sometimes call them “nervous habits.” I
  used to dismiss the remark because I was not nervous. Later, I realized I was
  making _them_ uneasy with my actions. It is important to remember people
  sometimes read body language the wrong way and become uncomfortable. Be sure
  your actions convey the right message. Ask for feedback and accept it. First
  impressions are important; we do not often have the opportunity for others to
  get to know us.

  ### Maintain trust with selflessness


  > "When relationships break down or never take hold, self-orientation is often
  to blame. Furthermore, self-orientation and intimacy play off each other to
  create a negative or positive spiral, depending on the weakness or strength of
  both."- The Power of Presence, page 106


  When we feel we must protect our interests whether the concern is avoiding the
  pain of rejection, loss of money on a sale, or missing out on a prestigious
  position, we communicate self-orientation. It separates us, and we sacrifice
  trust in our relationships. Although it may seem contrary to our interests,
  acts of selflessness restore our connection and transform faltering
  relationships. Doing things for others, even when it is hard, communicates
  that we have their best interest at heart and restores their trust in us. When
  our presence conveys respect and appreciation instead of self-orientation we
  build strong, trusting relationships.


  Keep your focus positive. We have a strong emotional reaction to loss and fear
  of losing. We all sometimes struggle which can start a downward spiral that
  leads to self-orientation. When we are in a self-protection frame of mind,
  others read our orientation through our actions and react defensively. That
  reaction sets up our defense mechanisms to protect ourselves from failure or
  embarrassment, and we mistrust others intentions. Our presence reflects our
  internal barrier; our actions communicate that we are safeguarding ourselves,
  and others shut us out emotionally. Doing things for others keeps our mind
  focused outward and is a great everyday practice that keeps us out of the
  damaging self-orientation cycle.

  ### Build strength with competency and vulnerability


  > "Connection enhances presence when you reveal your competency alongside your
  vulnerability. It shows you are human, just like the rest of us."- The Power
  of Presence, page 88


  Our performance is often measured by metrics, how perfectly we do our job.
  Unfortunately, people cannot relate to perfection. We admire it, but we
  connect with others’ vulnerability. Displaying our vulnerabilities might make
  us feel like others will regard us as incompetent or expose us to rejection or
  embarrassment. In reality, we all know no one is perfect. Projecting
  perfection makes us appear untrustworthy, and we will not establish lasting
  relationships. Missed connections result in employee disengagement and
  turnover and loss of clients even when the business is strong in other
  respects.


  A great way to make others feel comfortable and connected is to ask them for
  their honest feedback. It is one way of acknowledging that we are not perfect
  and that we care about how we impact others. Another way is to tell stories
  about strengths and shortcomings. Keep the stories short, centered on things
  everyone can relate to and understand and apply to the situation.
  Perfectionism is a barrier. It alienates others and people avoid you. Humanity
  creates an authentic, open presence, conveys self-assurance and strength. It
  makes you unforgettable.
f_conclusion: >-
  Most of us are not in a position where the public scrutinizes every detail of
  what we do and say but whatever it is that we do, we come into contact with
  other people. The way others see us is important to everyone. A powerful
  presence opens doors, we get more opportunities and the possibility of
  creating opportunities for others. Soft skills are not unimportant. A solid
  education and impressive resume might get you an interview, but if you cannot
  connect on a human level, you may not get the job. The secret to effective
  leadership is inspiring others to follow. We follow when we feel a connection.

> "My goals are to get you to reorient your beliefs about what makes a strong executive presence and rid yourself of limiting behaviors, while providing you with new ways of thinking and doing." _\- The Power of Presence, page 5_

Whether you are an executive, a leader, a manager, a job seeker, changing careers or just trying to increase your effectiveness, Kristi Hedges offers valuable advice in _The Power of Presence._ She shares her treasure trove of extensive professional experience as a communications expert, entrepreneur, and leadership coach. The way we present ourselves, our presence, can determine whether we reach our goals and our potential or whether we fail to connect and miss opportunities.

Hedges presents us with her three-part _I-Presence_ model and through a series of stories, case studies, strategies, tools and exercises teaches us to be _Intentional, Individual,_ and _Inspirational_. Throughout the book, she has included many actionable exercises and lists key takeaways from every chapter along with a special notes section to bring all of her ideas together and make them easily accessible. Understanding and practicing her technique helps align what we want to convey to others with what they perceive. She shows us how to become more intentional while we remain our authentic self which inspires others and creates impact.

For this summary, I will focus on overcoming obstacles to strong relationships. Nervousness, insecurity, and self-orientation are feelings that interfere with connection and undermine our potential by negatively affecting our presence. If we focus on our intentions and how we communicate we can turn them into strengths that make us inspirational. For some actionable tips, read on.
