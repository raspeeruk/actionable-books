  ### "Sensible" is Not the Best Metric for Your Ideas


  > "The natural tendency is to recoil from these ideas, because everything
  inherent to that kind of creativity requires breaking away from the norm,
  going against the grain, and leaning into risk and fear."- The Power of
  Starting Something Stupid, page 80


  Wet the clay sculpture. Smear black seeds all over it. Watch them grow into a
  green fur all over the sculpture. What a stupid idea.


  **Half a million** Chia Pets are sold each year.


  Fling birds at pigs. If that’s not the stupidest idea for a game ever I don’t
  know stupid.


  In 2011 Rovio confirmed a profit of **$106 million.**


  Western Union didn’t want to buy Bell’s invention, the **telephone**, because
  it had no value.


  Financial experts called **Henry Ford**’s invention a fad.


  Fired from the newspaper where he worked because he lacked imagination, **Walt
  Disney** turned to other things.


  **Elvis Presley** was asked to leave the Grand Ole Opry after a single
  performance because he was “goin’ nowhere.”


  The so-called experts said nobody would want to listen to digital music files
  they said couldn’t be sold and watch homemade television shows or have video
  chats with people on the other side of the world, **all considered impossibly
  stupid ideas even after they were proven feasible.**


  It’s a well-kept secret in modern business that **the purpose of analysis is
  to find a way to say “no” to things**. In their seminal In Search of
  Excellence Tom Peters and Bob Waterson pointed out that businesses which left
  slack for experiments, dumb ideas that might not pan out, were the ones who
  struck gold with strokes of genius.


  As Richard Branson says, protect the downside. But your stupid ideas might be
  the best ideas you’ve ever had.


  It’s easy to assume that the brilliant ideas which have shaped the world we
  live in were recognized by both the creators and their peers, hailed as genius
  from day one.


  I don’t know of a single case where that’s true.


  **Before things are considered normal, they’re new. And before they’re new,
  they’re just stupid.**

  ### Service is the Greatest Evidence of Resolve


  > "\[S\]erving others is powerful evidence to the ones we serve of our
  resolve."- The Power of Starting Something Stupid, page 206


  A large section of the book explains the acronym START: Serve, Thank, Ask,
  Receive, Trust. Like Stephen M. R. Covey’s [_The Speed of
  Trust_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-speed-of-trust/), each is
  worthy of an entire book.


  I’ve long said that generosity is your greatest marketing tool. Norton’s
  explanation is that when we serve unselfishly we win in multiple ways:


  *   Make strategic connections

  *   Overcome the Time/Education/Money gap

  *   Establish credibility and earn trust

  *   Gain experience

  *   Low-risk learning


  Giving without an agenda connects you with others in **a visceral manner** not
  possible through staid business efforts. It’s the basis of Zig Ziglar’s claim
  that you can have everything you want if you help enough other people have
  what they want.

  ### The Stupid Loop


  > "\[I\]f your stupid project becomes successful, it will likely become
  accepted, then considered smart, and then standardized, and eventually,
  normal."- The Power of Starting Something Stupid, page 87


  Remember Howard Aiken’s comment? “Don’t worry about people stealing an idea.
  If it’s original, you will have to ram it down their throats.”


  In _Crossing the Chasm,_ Geoffrey A. Moore used Rogers’ Distribution Curve to
  teach us that between early adopters and the general masses lay a chasm it was
  difficult, sometimes impossible to cross. Even early adopters need education
  to accept something radically new.


  Norton points out the risks of our stupid ideas becoming normal: if we get
  comfortable with normal, stop innovating, starting stupid stuff, we make
  ourselves irrelevant.


  I’m focusing on the pattern itself, what he calls the Stupid Loop: **from
  stupid to smart to normal.**


  Because **every brilliant idea in the world has gone through the same loop.**


  When you can’t let go of an idea, when you lose sleep over it, when you simply
  cannot not do it, that stupid idea has **every chance of becoming tomorrow’s
  normal.**


  Your willingness to pay the price in blood, sweat, and tears will prove to
  yourself and to others that maybe it’s not so stupid after all.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Power of Starting Something Stupid_ is a deep and complex book. Its seed
  was planted by tragedy: the death of Norton’s 21-year-old brother, and two
  years later, his own 2-month-old son. As a result, it has an emotional punch,
  an immediacy greater than most self-help or business books.

> "Stupid ideas come from a very powerful, creative space within our hearts and minds." _\- The Power of Starting Something Stupid, page 80_

In the early days of the 20th century it wasn’t unusual to hear of scam artists selling anything and everything through newspaper ads to trusting folks who were willing to pay a stranger for something they hadn’t seen; the proverbial “pig in a poke” – it was wiggling and squealing, and the guy holding the bag said it was a pig, so it must be a pig, right?

Until someone let the cat out of the bag.

Fast forward to the age of the internet. Can you imagine any sensible person repeating that business model, though in all sincerity, and thinking it had any chance of success? Selling merchandise sight unseen to strangers, over the internet. Who would pay for something they hadn’t seen? Who would be foolish enough to give money to a stranger for something they could walk down the street and buy for just a few dollars more? Who would wait for delivery just to save a few bucks?

Jeff Bezos sure was stupid when he started Amazon.

I don’t know of a single case where that’s true.

**Before things are considered normal, they’re new. And before they’re new, they’re just stupid.**

This summary barely scratches the surface. I encourage you to read the entire book and make use of it to give life to your own stupid idea.

And right down there in the comments, tell us: **what’s _your_ stupid idea?**
