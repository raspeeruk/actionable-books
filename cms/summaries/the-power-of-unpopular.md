  ### Being Popular Sucks


  > "If you build a business in order to be popular, you're going to fail - and
  fail the same way every time."- The Power of Unpopular, page 8


  Author Napoletano presents the idea of re-thinking of the word ‘popular’ in
  business by digging into five key concepts that are the engine in ‘the power
  of unpopular’:


  *   Personality

  *   Approachability

  *   Sharability

  *   Scalability

  *   Profitability


  _Personality_ is being authentic and putting a human face on every aspect of
  your product and how you do business. There are four parts of brand
  personality. ‘The Who’ (making everything you do human), ‘Growing a Pair of
  Balls’ (have a strong, courageous opinion), ‘Emotional Aspects of Brand
  Personality’ (how to acknowledge what’s important), and ‘Practical Aspects of
  Brand Personality’ (the visual representation of your brand).
  _Approachability_ means that your messaging and interactions with your
  customers and prospects transmits: “Hey! We understand you. We’re here and we
  hear you! Come on inside, and we’ll take care of you.” _Sharability_ is
  creating a ‘brand advocate army’ that empowers your audience to share your
  message through your marketing activities and having a website that “gets over
  itself and embrace(s) that 80 percent of your messaging should be about
  everything _except_ your brand…only 20 percent of what you put into the
  business should be about your company.” _Scalability_ discusses being able to
  rachet up your business to respond to growing demand. Finally, _profitability_
  covers understanding the value that you bring to your market and having the
  foundations of being profitable at every stage of development.

  ### Build For Those Who Will Love You – No One Else Matters


  > "The people who will never love your brand are the greatest gift you could
  ever receive as a businessperson."- The Power of Unpopular, page 31


  The intro quote above is a paraphrase of the subtitle of the book. For me,
  thinking through the meaning of fully serving an audience and being
  passionately focused on serving their needs provided a powerful “a-ha”!
  **Getting clear on the target audience that your business serves and kicking
  huge ass for them is _the_ starting point.** “Figure out what you want and
  hang out with the people willing to push on you to do more of that.”
  Understanding ‘the power of unpopular’ is fully accepting that your best
  friends are your customers and prospective customers. Making _them_ fiercely
  loyal and loud advocates is going to bring profits… and _meaning_ to your
  business operations and activities.

  ### Being Popular Just Isn't That Important. Got It?!


  > "We spend so much of our lives worrying about who likes us and what people
  think of us that we miss out on the most beautiful things along the way...and
  remember how fortunate we are to get live our dreams."- The Power of
  Unpopular, page 191


  The foundation of the book’s “unpopular is good” premise provides some of the
  most powerful points of having a business centered on its purpose. We start
  off on our entrepreneurial journeys reflexively, unthinkingly looking to reach
  as many people as possible and scale in order to make a fast grab at market
  share. In fact, being popular is the last place you want to be for the market
  that you serve. The core truth is that markets are transformed and moved by
  the implementation of leader companies’ “secret sauce”. **Understanding your
  company’s secret sauce is vital for success.** “Finding that something
  _particular_ that attracts one group and repels another to get to the point
  where you develop **solutions that are different and better than the ones
  currently available in your market.”**


  **“The audience you _think_ you serve and the audience who _actually_ wants
  what you have can be very different creatures.”** Napoletano drills the point
  home by quoting the late virtual reality researcher, Randy Pausch: “The size
  of the audience doesn’t matter. What’s important is that your audience is
  listening.”
f_conclusion: >-
  “It all begins with giving failure a big, fat hug.” Stop focusing on pleasing
  the people who are “never going to like you, your product, your service” and
  then “learn about the ones who already do (and just don’t know it).” For
  Napoletano’s clients, she counsels that to build a successful business, one
  must follow the five concepts covered above, pummel and push all your energies
  and efforts “building a business for _that_ audience instead of spinning your
  wheels on the myth of universal popularity.” **Bottom Line: being ‘unpopular’
  inside your market can be a key strategic advantage** with not only
  distinguishing your brand from your competitors but in transforming your
  market into something that truly matters to the people your efforts serve.

Why do so many business owners run their businesses trying to please everyone when it’s a full-on guarantee that you’re going to be pissing off plenty of people in the course of doing what your business needs to do? Blogger and digital strategist, Erika Napoletano makes the case in _The Power of Unpopular_ that too many business owners waste too much time trying to be popular that they lose a vital sense of what they are about. “Doing good business”, being self-aware enough to ‘fly your freak flag’ means there’s no reason to fear not being popular as long as you’re serving your customers and the people who make up your market.
