  ### The Duality of Mind - Communicate with your Subconscious


  > "What you write on the inside, you will experience on the outside.You have
  two sides to your life, objective and subjective, visible and invisible,
  thought and its manifestation."- The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, page 46


  Your subconscious can be thought of as your book of life. The thoughts,
  beliefs, opinions and theories you chose to write and impress on your
  subconscious mind is what you will experience through physical circumstances
  and events.


  There are two parts of your mind: the conscious mind (objective), and the
  subconscious mind (subjective). Your conscious mind is the one which reasons
  and deals with objects. It gains its knowledge through your five senses and
  through its contact with the external world. You can think of it as your guide
  and director in the external world and environment.


  Realizing that your subconscious mind is always working, during the day and
  night, is the first step in working with it. Murphy outlines three tactics
  that you can use to cultivate a relationship with your subconscious:


  **Repetition:** Feeding your subconscious mind with repeated constructive and
  harmonious thoughts will lead to the formation of new, healthier, habits for
  your subconscious mind. Make an effort to think positive thoughts about
  yourself.


  **Suggestion:** We all have our own fears, beliefs, and opinions. These are
  the inner assumptions that govern and guide our lives. Through the power of
  suggestion you are able to suggest thoughts to your conscious mind.
  Proactively suggest new beliefs to your subconscious. If you are afraid of
  flying, for example, continuously think about statistics regarding the safety
  of air travel. Eventually your subconscious will start to believe you.


  **Visualizations:** Mental visualizations are powerful way to convey an idea
  to your subconscious. Once you can feel and believe what you are visualizing
  you can create it. To apply this, create a vivid mental picture of yourself
  successfully performing a task. Repeat this frequently to effectively imprint
  it on your subconscious.

  ### Your Subconscious Mind as a Partner in Success


  > "Success means successful living. When you are peaceful, happy, joyous, and
  doing what you love to do, you are successful."- The Power of Your
  Subconscious Mind, page 175


  When it comes to your subconscious mind and achieving success, the thoughts
  and ideas you imprint on your mind are vital. Murphy believes the true inner
  meaning of success is to be successful at the enterprise of living. He
  believes that by implementing the three steps, anyone can obtain “success.”


  **Step 1 – Find the thing you love to do, then do it.**


  Loving your work is the first step of obtaining success. If you do not love
  your work it will be very difficult to be successful: you lack the drive
  required to pursue a level of achievement. When you do love your work you will
  constantly be striving to be successful.


  **Step 2 – Specialize in some particular branch of work.**


  When you specialize your work, you can strive for excellent in your niche.
  Your enthusiasm paired with a desire for excellence will help you to surpass
  other generalists in the field.


  **Step 3 – It must benefit humanity.**


  When you are certain that your work is serving the world, it closes the
  circuit on a successful, happy life.


  Murphy goes on to explain that although some people seem successful with
  material wealth, when money is at the centre of success we create a mood of
  lack and limitation. This influences the subconscious, and manifests in our
  bodies, homes, and relationships with others. What we think and feel we end up
  creating. What we create, we believe.

  ### Apply Techniques of Mental Healing


  > "All your experience and everything that enters into your life depends upon
  the nature of the mental building blocks that you use in the construction of
  your mental home. Your word is silent and invisible; nevertheless, it is real.
  You are building your mental home all the time, and your thoughts and mental
  imagery represent your blueprint."- The Power of Your Subconscious Mind, page
  93-94


  Murphy shares several techniques that he has studied which are effective at
  constructing a mental home, that he has studied and used to to communicate and
  imprint the subconscious mind. Thee notable examples are:


  **The Baudoin Technique**


  Baudoin was a psychotherapist who discovered that the best way to impress the
  subconscious mind was to enter into a drowsy, sleepy state, in which all
  effort was reduced to a minimum. Chose a thought or idea you want to imprint
  and convey it to your subconscious in a passive and receptive way through
  reflection. Condense the thought or idea in a brief phrase which can be
  readily etched on the memory, and to repeat it over and over again as a
  lullaby.


  **The “Thank You” Technique**


  Practice expressing gratitude and and giving thanks _before_ you achieve
  success. When you create this feeling of thankfulness in your mind and heart,
  what you desire will be attracted to you.


  **The Affirmative Method**


  When you affirm something, you state that it is true. Repeating an affirmation
  will lead the subconscious mind to a state of receptiveness, and will begin to
  accept it.

  All in all I really enjoyed learning about the subconscious mind and the
  different techniques and exercises described in this book. I believe the main
  theme of this book is still relevant and applicable today, although some of
  the stories and religious verses were not to my tastes.
f_quote-2: >-
  “As you sow in your subconscious mind, so shall you reap in your body and
  environment. Imagine your subconscious mind as a bed of rich soil that will
  help all kinds of seeds to sprout and flourish, whether good or bad. Every
  thought is a cause, and every condition is an effect. This is the reason it is
  so essential that you take charge of your thoughts. In that way, you can bring
  forth only desirable conditions.”

The Power of the Subconscious Mind, is an interesting read on the inner workings of your mind and how it impacts your behavior and life. Originally published in 1962, this book contributed to the New Thought movement and contains a variety of techniques and exercises that help you understand and communicate with your subconscious mind. The underlying theme of this book is the the messages we carry from our upbringing through parents, and teachers etc. become our personal stories. Regardless of if they are bad or good, they filter down through our conscious mind and seep into our subconscious which then influences our behavior. The messages we choose to believe then determine the level of success we think we are either capable or incapable of achieving in our life.
