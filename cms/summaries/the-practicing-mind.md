  ### Take Back the Reins


  > "We need to be more aware of what we are doing, what we are thinking, and
  what we are intending to accomplish in order to gain control of what we
  experience in life."- The Practicing Mind, Chapter 4


  As you read the last paragraph how many times were you thinking about
  something other than what you were reading? My question isn’t rooted in deep
  seeded narcissism but rather to prove a point, one that rocked my paradigm as
  I began to process Sterner’s book. The idea, for instance, is that I may
  physically be in class, but am I really there? Am I striving to focus on what
  is being said and digesting the information I am learning? Or am I thinking
  about what I’ll have for dinner, or the book I am reading, or that trip I am
  going on this weekend?


  It is difficult to maintain a present mindset, to be focused on now when you
  are contemplating several other tasks that need to be completed or day
  dreaming about what you would rather be doing than what you are presently
  doing.


  Sterner defines a practicing mind as one who is focused on the process and the
  present moment. The author repeatedly emphasizes the importance of staying in
  the present as the foundation for a practicing mind. He illustrates this point
  with an analogy of the mind to a chariot driver. The driver has lost the reins
  and become a passenger, at the mercy of his horses. Similarly, an individual
  who does not take the reins of their mind will be tossed to-and-fro and will
  lack direction. In contrast, Sterner explains that by focusing on what one is
  doing now, at any given time he can take back the reins and direct the
  direction of the chariot.


  Now that you are back in control of the reins, where to?

  ### Enjoy the Journey


  > "Do you think that a flower seed sits in the ground and says, ‘This is going
  to take forever. I have to push all this dirt out of my way just to get to the
  surface and see the sun... When do I get to bloom? That's when I'll be happy;
  that's when everybody will be impressed with me.’"- The Practicing Mind,
  Chapter 3


  Life is too short to waste the present longing for the future. What frequent
  things in your life do you fail to notice and enjoy because you are not
  present? For me, I am able to walk my wife to work on my way to class. That is
  something I probably will not always be able to do. If I only concentrate on
  graduation (the goal) I miss an event that when noticed makes the present more
  enjoyable. By striving to be present and focusing on the process, enjoying the
  journey becomes more realistic.


  To teach this concept Sterner explains that a flower is doing exactly what it
  should be at each stage of its life. “Just because it does not have brightly
  colored blooms doesn’t mean it is not a good flower seed. When it first
  sprouts through the ground, it is not imperfect because it displays only the
  color green.” The growth of a flower follows a process in which each stage
  must be completed before the next can begin; it must sprout as a seed long
  before it can begin to bloom. We should adopt a similar approach to any
  endeavor in our lives.

  ### Focus on the Process


  > "So many people ... look at the process of working for something as an
  annoying effort they have to go through to get what they want. They make the
  thing the goal, instead of the process of getting that thing. Just getting the
  thing produces a very small return on investment of inner joy compared with
  the dividend gleaned from the process of getting there and achieving the goal.
  The key word here is achieving. Getting the goal and achieving it are worlds
  apart. Most people spend their lives on an endless treadmill: they get one
  thing after another, but they get no experience of lasting joy or personal
  growth..."- The Practicing Mind, Chapter 5


  At first it may seem a semantical difference to focus on the process in place
  of the product. To distinguish the ideas Sterner uses the example of a sailor
  attempting to reach the horizon. If the sailor uses the horizon as his
  benchmark for achievement he will forever be disappointed. Despite his most
  valiant efforts he will always fall short. Instead, if the sailor elected to
  focus on the sailing of the ship and evaluated his success by that gauge, if
  he stays in the present moment, his odds of achieving his purpose increase
  greatly.


  What do you use as your metric for success? It is not the process of signing a
  big new client, but the process and effort you invested to win the account. It
  is not the graduation ceremony and piece of paper but the process of expanding
  your mind and developing your abilities over the course of your education that
  make it a rewarding experience.


  Strive to achieve and focus on the process.
f_conclusion: >-
  I had a difficult time digesting this book. The author’s repeated admonitions
  for focusing on the here and now, and the process, for me, spotlighted how
  many times during the day I wasn’t present and fixated on the end result
  enduring the process. So I made a deliberate effort to evaluate at the end of
  each activity. It is easy to stifle the ambition to be present once the topic
  or task turns to something I find less than uninteresting. Resisting the urge
  to let my mind drift to something more interesting left me taxed by the end of
  the first day. However, with a consistent effort I found it less strenuous by
  the end of my experiment. Curiously, through a spillover effect, the attention
  directed to the process and the current moment has made the things I enjoy
  doing more engaging.

> "All things of lasting and deep value require time and nurturing and come to us only through our own effort." _\- The Practicing Mind, Chapter 9_

From a young age we learn the importance of paying attention: in school, while learning to drive, when someone is speaking to us. However, as adults the emphasis on attention to what we are doing right now decreases. Many people wear multitasking as a badge of pride. Rather than focusing on what we are doing, we pine away the present moment wishing we were doing something else. Wishing it was the weekend, or the end of the day. However, focusing and paying attention to the task at hand isn’t just something to raise well behaved children, regardless of age you can benefit from developing such a focused state of mind.

Thomas Sterner, author of _The Practicing Mind,_ prepares pianos for world class performances. His craft requires minute tunings of each of the 88 notes on a piano. Every adjustment must be made to each of the 88 strings resulting in thousands of identical repetitive actions, a task that most would consider tedious and a perfect reason to tune out. With that background Sterner makes a compelling case for why everyone can benefit from what he calls a practicing mind, and it all begins with a chariot rider.

Thanks for reading and hopefully being present.

How could being present help you?
