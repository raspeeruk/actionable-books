  ### Do What You Love


  > "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life."- The
  Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, page 217


  _The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs_ is not just another presentation
  skills book. It also contains life and success lessons along the way.


  Steve Jobs had purpose and passion. He felt the work he was doing made a big
  difference. He got the big picture right first by finding what he loved to do
  in life.


  **Are you doing what you love with your life?** If you are passionate about
  what you choose to do for work, you will be able to convey that passion when
  you present. You will truly believe your own message. How would you deliver a
  passionate performance if you’re not excited by what you’re saying? Start with
  the big picture first by doing great work–work you love.


  Steve Jobs used his passion to convince others when he spoke. In 1983, Jobs
  wanted to hire John Sculley, then PepsiCo president. Sculley was unconvinced
  by the offer–though he was excited by what Apple was up to, he didn’t want to
  move his family or earn less money. Steve Jobs challenged Sculley to come on
  board by asking:


  “Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you
  want a chance to change the world?” Sculley said that those words were like a
  blow to the stomach and the words would “haunt” him until he joined Apple.

  ### Prepare to Amaze


  > "Jobs had literally crank-called a Starbucks as part of the demo."- The
  Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, page 143


  **How can you use variety and staging to make your presentations exciting?**


  With perfect lighting, large screens and cheering fans, Steve Jobs was more
  like a rock star when presenting than a CEO. He worked hard to create that
  excitement, by creating a well-staged presentation, changing the format
  regularly and appealing to the different ways that members of the audience
  learn.


  Steve Jobs prepared for his presentations with full rehearsals of every aspect
  of the presentation. He paid attention to how he could create excitement for
  Apple’s products through the use of:


  *   Picture-rich slides

  *   Sound, video and lighting

  *   Product demonstrations


  Jobs knew that the audience would start looking at the clock after 10 minutes
  if he didn’t keep it fresh and exciting. So, he introduced a variety of
  different formats to keep the audience interested. When demonstrating how
  Google Maps worked on the iPhone, he searched for a nearby Starbucks and said
  “let’s give them a call”, doing so by using the device on stage. He then
  placed an order for four thousand lattes to go, before admitting that he was
  kidding and hanging up!


  Other ways that Jobs would change things up in his presentations:


  *   Inviting other presenters to share the stage

  *   Appealing to different senses by passing out product examples for people
  to touch and hold

  *   Playing Apple advertisements


  What different formats can you use to keep _your_ audience engaged?

  ### Tell Me a Story


  > " …a Steve Jobs presentation is very much like a dramatic play – a finely
  crafted and well-rehearsed performance that informs, entertains and
  inspires."- The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, page xv


  **All good stories have a beginning, middle and an end.** Steve Jobs would
  tell the audience what he planned to cover in his presentation by giving them
  a verbal roadmap. There were no agenda slides in Job’s presentation. Instead,
  he would tell the audience what he was going to tell them. He would often
  begin by outlining three points that he was going to cover. For example, when
  he introduced the iPhone in 2007, he told the audience that he was introducing
  three revolutionary products: a widescreen iPod, a phone, and an internet
  communications device.


  To create your own verbal roadmap:


  *   List the key points that you intend to cover in your presentation

  *   Group those points into three main messages

  *   Write a script that briefly introduces the main messages, to use at the
  start of your presentation


  To create drama in a story or presentation, we need a villain or a problem.
  What problem does your product or service solve? Describe the situation in
  detail–let people feel the pain! When Jobs launched the iPhone, he set up the
  villain as every other smartphone on the market. He took the time to explain
  the various problems: smartphones were complicated, buttons were fixed, and
  it’s too easy to lose a stylus.


  Now you’ve set the scene and the audience is feeling the pain. Enter the
  conquering hero! **How does your product or service save the day?** Remember
  that your audience is not really interested in your product–they are
  interested in solving their problems. Jobs dramatically described how the
  Apple would solve all current problems with smartphones: by introducing the
  fast, flexible and easy-to-use iPhone.
f_conclusion: >-
  Steve Jobs was fiercely passionate about the ability of Apple’s products to
  change the world. He was committed to excellence in his presentations so he
  could share the message that he so strongly believed. Through telling stories,
  creating drama and well-rehearsed staging, Steve Job’s presentations delighted
  audiences and left the media buzzing.

> "Stay hungry, stay foolish." _\- The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs, page 215_

Steve Jobs was hungry. Always hungry to learn, advance and excel. **His philosophy was to do what you love, view setbacks as opportunities and dedicate yourself to the passionate pursuit of excellence.** This applied to all aspects of his life, and perhaps never more so than when he was preparing to present on stage.

Many think Steve Jobs was a genius. However, what he demonstrated when presenting is _mastery_. He put in countless hours and demanded the best from those who supported him.

_The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs_ by Carmine Gallo covers everything from the basics of presenting, including structure and concepts on slide design, through scripting and all the way to the detailed dress rehearsals that set Jobs up for success.

The book is organized into three “acts”, as follows:

**Act 1: Create the Story**. Here we find the surprising revelation that when planning to present, he started on paper! Presentations were written with the media in mind, by creating attention-grabbing headlines. Jobs created stories with tension by introducing antagonists and heroes, playing off against each other to a dramatic conclusion.

**Act 2:** **Deliver the Experience**. The Zen aesthetic that Apple is famous for was reflected in Job’s slides. He created an interactive and fun experience by using demonstrations, props, jokes, videos and by inviting other presenters to share the stage.

**Act 3:** **Refine and rehearse**. Steve Jobs would spend days rehearsing, getting feedback, testing technology and lighting. His natural delivery may have appeared to be off-the-cuff, but it was the result of many hours of planning and preparation.
