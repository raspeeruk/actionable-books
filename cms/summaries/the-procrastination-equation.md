  ### The Quick Impulsive Test


  > "The greater the delay, the less your motivation."- The Procrastination
  Equation, page 29


  Time is the one part of the procrastination equation that resonated with me
  personally. To demonstrate how powerful time (delay) is on motivation, Steel
  uses this quick test.


  Let’s say I put $1,000 cash into your hands (10 crisp $100 bills). You can
  keep this money and walk right now. However, I also have a certified cheque,
  post-dated for one year from today. Here is the dilemma. What is the minimum
  amount that I have to put on that cheque for you to reach into your pocket and
  hand back the $1,000 cash, take the cheque, and wait a year to cash it. Quick!
  Immediate gut reaction! How much?!


  Steel finds that most people are between $2,000 and $3,000. If you have been
  taught calculations of common interest rates and give it some thought, you’ll
  have a much lower answer, but a quick emotional reaction drives that cheque
  figure much higher. The higher the amount on the cheque, the more impulsive
  you are; the more that you like to satisfy immediate needs and put off future
  enjoyment. Really when you think about it, that is why we procrastinate:
  because we are impulsive. **We trade short term pleasure for long term pain.**

  ### Visualize and Contrast


  > "Whether the task is preparing for exams, getting a job, smoking less, or
  improving personal relationships, she (the researcher) found that the
  worst-performing group used positive fantasies alone. You are better off not
  using this technique at all."- The Procrastination Equation, page 129


  Basically, just visualizing yourself doing the task (Creative Visualization)
  isn’t enough, and in some cases it’s actually worse than doing nothing. You
  need to take a few extra steps to help make your visualization a reality:


  *   Break off a manageable piece of your future by focusing on just one aspect
  of your desire.

  *   Elaborate on all that makes this mental picture attractive to you.

  *   Mentally contrast this future with where you are now. Focus on the gap.
  Put the same emphasis on vividly reflecting on this discrepancy as you did on
  imagining your idealized future.


  You should feel optimistic about realizing this ideal future which in turn
  creates motivation. **Motivation is the key in limiting procrastination.** The
  procrastination should disappear as you actively close the gap. You know what
  to do and you have the drive to do it.

  ### Frame Your Goals in Specific Terms


  > "Goal setting – proper goal setting – is the smartest thing you can do to
  battle procrastination."- The Procrastination Equation, page 191


  Like most of you, I set personal and professional goals. We have all heard of
  the SMART method, where your goals must be **S**pecific, **M**easurable,
  **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, and **T**imely. Without addressing those
  specific criteria, goals will usually fail. However, Steel breaks down the
  SMART theory and adds in some depth to the Timely criteria. Example, frame
  your goals in specific terms so that you know precisely when you have to
  achieve them. Instead of “Do my expense report tomorrow”, it should be “Gather
  all my receipts, itemize them and record them by lunchtime tomorrow.” Instead
  of “Lose weight this year”, it should be “Limit my calories to 1,700 per day
  by eating a set menu for each meal and exercising for one hour at 4:30pm each
  day.” By putting a time-stamp on it and by breaking down the goal into
  manageable chunks, we tend not to blow it off so easily.
f_conclusion: >-
  Piers Steel does a great job dissecting procrastination: what it is, its
  financial costs, the stress it causes, and how we are naturally wired to do
  it. By using personal examples (that I related to more than I care to admit),
  he really helped me develop a connection with the book. I was totally
  impressed with the last chapter where he takes the three fictional characters
  and implements his solutions into their lives. It makes it real and gives the
  reader the motivation to take steps in reducing the enormous stress that
  procrastination puts on our already busy lives.

Are you impulsive? **Are you distracted by shiny things?** If so, you are probably a procrastinator.

I wanted to start 2013 off on the right foot – do a little less procrastinating. **What better way to reduce my procrastination than to better understand it?**

In _The Procrastination Equation: How to Stop Putting Things Off and Start Getting Stuff Done_, author Piers Steel does an excellent job in defining procrastination and provides several assessments to determine how much you procrastinate and more importantly – what type of procrastinator you are by referring to three fictional characters. Who knew there were different kinds of procrastinators! _Low Expectancy Eddie_ believes that he will fail, has low self-confidence and little optimism, which deflates his motivation. _Valerie Without Value_ tends to put off what she doesn’t like doing (sound familiar?!). She doesn’t value the tasks she needs to complete so they don’t get done. _Time Sensitive Tom_ always over-estimates how much time he has left until it’s too late. “Never do today what you can do tomorrow” and then something else comes up which delays the task again.

To better understand procrastination, Steel provides a mathematical equation that explains how this problem causes much stress and in turn costs the economy billions of dollars each year. By breaking down each component of the equation, he also provides solutions to help you eliminate this nasty habit. **Motivation is the key in limiting procrastination.** Admittedly, his solutions aren’t anything earth-shattering or new, but his reinforcement of them makes you take note.
