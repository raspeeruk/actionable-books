  ### Work Work Work Work Work


  > "Productivity techniques exist to help you work smarter. But they're only
  useful when you still do the work."- The Productivity Project, page 157


  When I read the above quote, I think I actually said “thank you” out loud.
  Productivity is such a meaty topic that all professionals, teams, management,
  consultants continually eat up. I think many people could relate to at least
  one experience being in a meeting or part of a discussion on all the ways that
  people can work smarter. Don’t get me wrong, it’s super valuable and I took
  away some great Insights to share with you. However, at the end of the day you
  still need to accomplish something, there needs to be results. Productivity
  equals accomplishing and busyness is not invited. Procrastination starts to
  rear its head when a task is boring, frustrating, difficult, unstructured or
  ambiguous, lacking in personal meaning, or lacking in intrinsic reward (not
  fun or engaging). In other words, it can happen often. Procrastination can
  become a (bad) habit where you may be procrastinating without even realizing
  it. Translation: lost precious minutes that could be used oh so much more
  wisely. In terms of being able to accomplish more or work smarter, my personal
  demon is procrastination. My Insights below are how I am going to battle. So
  while naturally an optimist, the worst case scenario is that you’re going to
  spend more time considering being productive than actually being productive.
  So let me challenge you to commit to and complete a 25 minute productive task,
  post reading the summary, where you are creating a result. You got this.

  ### Take back control


  > "Your head is not for holding ideas it is for having ideas."- The
  Productivity Project, page 149


  Sometimes we just have a lot we want to do: short term, long term, high and
  low returns, personal tasks, professional goals… I am overwhelmed just
  thinking about it. So how do we literally “dump” this list from our brains so
  it we can focus on the productive things we have at hand? We’re going old
  school here –get out the pen and paper. Write it down, get it all out. The
  simple task of just externalizing your internal lists opens up the ability for
  you to then focus on what you need to be doing. So if you’re friend
  procrastination keeps popping up making you feel bad about all the other tasks
  you have on your plate, invite him over for a shortened amount of time and
  have a go. Beware though! This can easily be a trap of busyness trying to
  pretend it is productivity. You’re going to feel really great about your list
  and you will easily think you’ve been productive. You haven’t! Not until you
  start scratching some of those things off the list. The above is at the most
  basic and immediate level. If you’re ready for the Serena leap, which involves
  prioritizing your top three tasks daily and weekly and staying aligned. This
  is in part taking your massive brain dump and starting to determine how much
  time, energy and attention you will spend towards your highest and lowest
  return tasks. Now you’re balancing your time on what you _really_ want to
  accomplish. Future self for the win. (Again!)

  ### Shrink it


  > "Parkinson's law states that your work expands to fit the amount of time you
  have available for it."- The Productivity Project, page 123


  I can only speak for myself, but how often when you give yourself an hour to
  do something you become so amazing and manage to accomplish not only your
  intended task but three more?! For me that is not often and if I do finish
  early I tend to reward myself with procrastination. How about when your boss
  says “so I am going to need that in 30 minutes, the meeting got bumped up.”
  Now suddenly you have superpowers and you’ve just nailed the task in no time.
  Tasks with low reward or importance will continue to drag on. The same can be
  said for really large, daunting tasks. You’re overwhelmed with where to begin
  so you just hang out with procrastination instead. Shrinking your time is such
  an easy actionable tool that your future self will love. Side note: the author
  talks about setting up your future self for success in detail and my future
  self would like to say how great she thinks that is. All you have to do is
  block out the time you would normally set aside for a task and shrink it. This
  brings a sense of urgency and purpose to your task. Similarly for the second
  example where you have big task ahead of you, start with 25 minutes first.
  Once you’ve done that, go from there. Those are the steps, if you’re ready for
  the Serena leap you can try “Pomodoro Time.” Basically you work for 25 minutes
  straight, take 5, do that four times and then take a 15 minute break. Rinse.
  Repeat. Not only are you now feeling productive, but you actually are! Future
  self is throwing out high fives.
f_conclusion: >-
  It is important to reflect on your productivity and to consider opportunities
  to make changes or improvements, but don’t let that come at the price of
  actually not accomplishing anything. I am going to sneak in one last
  actionable recommendation and that is to pay attention. Be mindful of what
  you’re doing, how you’re doing it, and what the impacts are. If you’ve got a
  good thing going, keep it going. But if you don’t, then you have to change it
  up and I don’t just mean talking about working smarter strategies. By paying
  attention, externalizing your tasks and doing the work in a focused time you
  will with no doubt see results in your accomplishments. Because challenges are
  fun, I am going to add one more and that is to pick one of the actionable
  tools provided and try it in the next 24 hours and write down the top three
  benefits and, most importantly, what you were able to accomplish as a result.

  "When someone says they ‘don't have time’ for something what they're really
  saying is that a task isn't as important or attractive as whatever else they
  have on their plate. Every person gets twenty-four hours of time every day and
  gets to spend those twenty-four hours however he or she chooses."

Oh, you’re interested in learning more about leading a more productive lifestyle? Maybe improve on working smarter, not harder? Buckle up. Picking up _The Productivity Project_ is like being interested in tennis and picking up Serena Williams’s training schedule. It’s hard core, intense, and everything you need to take productivity either one step forward or a big giant Serena Williams leap ahead. The author literally went all in, and I mean _all in_, in researching and testing everything there is to know about productivity. The book is full of actionable steps or giant leaps that you can use in your day to day. Every chapter starts with a quick summary, estimated read time and ends with a challenge (even the layout is productive). What I really took away from this is how passionate Chris Bailey is about this subject. You can literally feel his energy come off the pages. Nothing gets me more jazzed than being around someone who is crushing their craft – the above quote is a great example. It also made me realize how important the intrinsic reward is when examining one’s productivity. Bailey wasn’t successful (sorry, spoiler alert) at every task he tried. Where he struggled the most was where it conflicted with his other greatest passion: food. So knowing that everything we do in life isn’t going to have to have high intrinsic reward, how do we still be productive? How do we ensure we are spending less time on those less interesting, though likely necessary tasks, and focus our best energy on the highest reward? Don’t fret, I’ve summed up my top actions below.
