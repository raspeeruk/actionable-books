  ### Money, Hours, and Hassle


  > "To begin customer-centric thinking, managers must reverse the traditional
  value chain…so that the customer is the first link in the chain."- The Profit
  Zone, page 20-21


  The principle I found the most striking (and it’s in the first chapter!) was
  that if you are to understand your clients, you need to reverse the value
  chain the way it has always been understood. The traditional value chain
  starts with the company’s assets or core competencies – what you’re good at –
  and ends with the customer.


  The Profit Zone happens when you turn that on its head, and start with what
  the customer really wants – and work through the chain to develop your core
  competencies around that. The problem is, you can’t figure that out by
  surveying your customers, or even doing ‘market research’. (That’s wonderful
  news for some of us – did you really want to pay expensive market
  researchers?) You figure out the things that are so important to customers
  that if they can’t get them, they’ll switch suppliers. Some of these will be
  spoken – many are silent.


  The critical economic formula comes down to three things: the money, hours,
  and hassle that the client will ‘pay’ for buying or using your product or
  service. Looking at how you save your customers money, or hours, or hassle –
  or all three – will be a light bulb moment for your business design. But that
  design should not remain static…

  ### Ask Yourself, "What Am I Afraid Of Finding Out?"


  > "Don’t spend your time with customers who like you. Seek out the customers
  who are the most demanding, the angriest, and the most insightful about
  tomorrow."- The Profit Zone, page 22


  Putting the customer first may just roll off your lips as a nice phrase, but
  reading this book should change entirely how you do that. As mentioned above,
  you don’t primarily focus all your efforts on surveys, or fancy research,
  because the customer is not always the one who truly knows what he (or she, or
  they) want. Look at Apple. They’re constantly coming up with new ideas that
  half the world complains about, or pretends they didn’t want, or insist that
  someone else is already doing. But every second person I see has an iPhone. Or
  when Facebook changes its news feed for the seventeenth time, even though
  complaints rage high, they’re using Facebook itself to lodge them. And
  eventually things die down and people continue using it.


  So it’s your job to find out what your customers really, truly, deep-down
  want: and the suggestion the Profit Zone makes is a scary one. To pick out the
  aggressive, the angry, the complaining, the most switched-on ones – and spend
  your time talking and listening to them. (On a personal note, I must say that
  this method has real value. The customers who ‘do my head in’, to use the
  phrase, are always the ones who cause me to rack my brain for a new way to do
  things.) And when you go into these customer dialogues, remember that it’s not
  about you. It’s not about finding out new information so you can have a
  profitable business and get into that magic zone. Ask yourself, “What am I
  afraid to find out?” – because this will give you all the clues needed to
  change your root business design, and capture tomorrow’s profits.

  ### Re-Invent Your Business Design Every Five Years


  > "The single biggest problem in business is staying with your previously
  successful business model… one year too long."- The Profit Zone, page 14


  The business model – which is where the profit zone comes from – is not
  static. It’s not something you set up when you begin your business, and then
  just make a little better, every day. If you have any hope of staying power,
  you’ll change. Often.


  This is where the modern business (one that was probably hardly imagined in
  Slywotzsky and Morrison’s day of penning this book) can come into its own. If
  you’re smart, you’re already changing constantly. Need to share files?
  YouSendIt. Oh- nope – that’s already outdated with Dropbox. Oh again – now
  it’s Google Drive. It used to be that technology changed with every revolution
  of the earth….now it’s with every revolution of the moon. If you’ve embraced
  change, and social media and a constantly-connected mobile world, you’re
  better placed to be changing the way you do business, too. “The reinventors
  know that the game is never over.”


  So the first thing you can do is say to yourself, “My current business model
  is probably outdated”. That will save you years of heartache learning it the
  hard way.
f_conclusion: >-
  Here’s my recommendation. Buy the book, and read the first three chapters. If
  you read the others that’s fine, but the first three should change your
  business life. Get an old-fashioned pen, and underline the bits that stand
  out, and take notes within the book. The notes I made in my copy completely
  changed our business design a few years ago – and happily, we just changed it
  again a few months ago.

For a book that’s been around for over 15 years, _The Profit Zone_ reads as though it was written yesterday – and in this day of instant-everything, that’s saying something.

This is one of the best business books I’ve ever read. It takes a little time to work through it, because every few paragraphs will make you stop and think – and probably jot down specific notes – about how you do business, why you do business, and what your clients really want.

The concept of getting into the profit zone by focusing not on your great product or service, but on what your prospective customers want and need, may seem simple (or overdone). It’s tempting to tune out – “I know, I know, I need to find out what my clients want and then give it to them, how is that a brand-new concept?”

But it doesn’t matter if you know what you ought to be doing. It matters if you are doing something about it.

### Money, Hours, and Hassle

> "To begin customer-centric thinking, managers must reverse the traditional value chain…so that the customer is the first link in the chain."- The Profit Zone, page 20-21

The principle I found the most striking (and it’s in the first chapter!) was that if you are to understand your clients, you need to reverse the value chain the way it has always been understood. The traditional value chain starts with the company’s assets or core competencies – what you’re good at – and ends with the customer.

The Profit Zone happens when you turn that on its head, and start with what the customer really wants – and work through the chain to develop your core competencies around that. The problem is, you can’t figure that out by surveying your customers, or even doing ‘market research’. (That’s wonderful news for some of us – did you really want to pay expensive market researchers?) You figure out the things that are so important to customers that if they can’t get them, they’ll switch suppliers. Some of these will be spoken – many are silent.

The critical economic formula comes down to three things: the money, hours, and hassle that the client will ‘pay’ for buying or using your product or service. Looking at how you save your customers money, or hours, or hassle – or all three – will be a light bulb moment for your business design. But that design should not remain static…
