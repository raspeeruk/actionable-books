  ### Making Progress, However Small, is the Greatest Indicator of Performance
  and Satisfaction


  > "\[O\]ur research is unambiguous. As inner work life rises and falls, so
  does performance...making progress in meaningful work is the most powerful
  stimulant to great inner work life."- The Progress Principle, pages 45 & 74


  Ask any manager what motivates their top workers, what would turn their
  laggards around, and they’ll comment on **carrots and sticks**. Extrinsic
  rewards and punishment are the average manager’s first (and often last)
  resort.


  It turns out that’s **wrong**. Studying data collected in real time from
  dozens of employees at seven companies, progress was the **outstanding
  causative factor**. Whether the company was floundering or flying, whether
  their manager was a saint or a jerk, it was the **daily small wins** which
  motivated people to **try harder,** to come up with **more creative**
  solutions, and to be **happier** while doing more.


  The Progress Principle states that progress contributes to positive inner work
  life, which contributes to progress, creating an **upward spiral of
  creativity, engagement, and performance.**


  **Inner work life** is defined as “the confluence of perceptions, emotions,
  and motivations that individuals experience as they react to and make sense of
  the events of their workday.” It is inner because it is invisible to others,
  including supervisors. It relates to work because that’s where it takes place,
  and that’s what it affects. And it is life because it is ongoing, growing and
  changing, and affects life outside work.


  Whether it’s employees, partners, co-workers, or our own children, fostering
  positive inner work life creates happiness while motivating greater
  performance. insight #1 describes some ways to do this. insight #2 highlights
  a critical warning about the asymmetry of good and bad events.

  ### Bad is Stronger Than Good


  > "The power of setbacks to increase frustration is more than three times as
  strong as the power of progress to decrease frustration."- The Progress
  Principle, page 92


  Humans are risk-averse, loss-averse. If you lose $10 you need to gain $20 to
  make up the emotional loss. Most people won’t gamble unless they’re likely to
  win at least twice what they’re risking.


  Inner work life is affected by the same rule: **setbacks diminish happiness
  more than twice as much** as progress boosts it, and increase frustration more
  than three times as much as progress decreases it.


  The message is clear: a manager’s **greatest risk** is allowing inhibitors and
  toxins in the workplace. Smoothing the path, then, becomes a manager’s **most
  important task**. Pete Drucker said the goal was “to make productive the
  specific strengths and knowledge of each individual.”


  These days most work is intrinsically meaningful. There are four **mechanisms
  which can negate that meaning,** damaging inner work life:


  *   having work or ideas **dismissed**

  *   losing **ownership** of one’s work

  *   knowing your work will **never be used**

  *   **grunt work;** work we’re greatly overqualified for.


  Besides avoiding these inhibiting toxic behaviors, engage in these four
  catalyzing nourishing behaviors:


  *   set the **climate**, one event at a time — habitually behave in a way
  which creates a positive trusting climate

  *   stay **attuned** every day — without accurate current information you
  cannot provide the nourishers and catalysts to promote positive inner work
  life

  *   **target** support — vague generalities don’t nourish

  *   **checking in,** not checking up — others know the difference between
  checking in to see how we can help those we trust and checking up on those we
  don’t to catch their mistakes.

  ### Support Progress with Catalysts and People with Nourishment


  > "\[C\]atalysts are triggers directed at the project, nourishers are
  interpersonal triggers, directed at the person."- The Progress Principle, page
  82


  Catalysts, actions which affect **work**, and nourishers, events which affect
  **people**, are powerful because while they contribute to progress, **even
  before that**, they contribute to positive inner work life. The effects of
  catalysts and nourishers are **immediate**.


  These are actions all of us can take to contribute to progress and positive
  inner work life in others.


  **The 7 Major Catalysts:**


  *   Setting clear **goals** — knowing where you’re going, and why

  *   Allowing **autonomy** — self-direction creates drive

  *   Providing **resources** — having the proper tools makes any task more
  efficient and enjoyable

  *   Giving enough **time**—but not too much — constant time pressure is
  destructive, and low time pressure contributes to boredom

  *   **Help** with the work — sometimes we all need information or skills we
  don’t have

  *   **Learning** from problems and successes — shining a non-judgmental light
  on failure in order to learn from it contributes to psychological safety

  *   Allowing **ideas** to flow — good communication without negativity


  **The 4 Major Nourishers:**


  *   **Respect** — recognition, honesty, civility

  *   **Encouragement** — enthusiasm, expressions of confidence

  *   **Emotional support** — people feel more connected when their emotions are
  validated by empathy

  *   **Affiliation** — actions which develop trust, appreciation, and affection


  Catalysts have opposites: **inhibitors**. Nourishers have opposites:
  **toxins**. The research confirmed the findings of [a 2001
  study](http://www.csom.umn.edu/Assets/71516.pdf): bad events carry more weight
  than their positive counterparts.
f_conclusion: >-
  Emphasizing the power of small wins, _The Progress Principle_ shows that
  **baby steps** are cumulative, not just practically, but emotionally.
  Progress, however small, contributes to joy, engagement, and creativity.

The husband-and-wife team of Amabile and Kramer have studied creativity for more than 35 years. Along the way, they have challenged some **long-held assumptions** about how we work, how we create.

During a year-long study involving over **120,000 work events reported as they happened**, they noticed a pattern: what mattered most in any work environment, no matter the worker’s basic personality or position in the company, **progress**, however small, was the **greatest indicator** of their happiness and performance.

Emphasizing the power of small wins, _The Progress Principle_ shows that **baby steps** are cumulative, not just practically, but emotionally. Progress, however small, contributes to joy, engagement, and creativity.

Note that **no special tools or circumstances** are needed. Managing for progress has far more to do with your **attitude** than your finances or equipment. Help everyone on the team make small wins every day. Smooth the path to avoid the amplified negativity of work inhibitors and personal toxins.

Whether you’re managing a team or monitoring your own inner work life, **habitually** engaging in the positive behaviors of the **progress loop** will increase joy, engagement, and creativity, contributing directly to happiness.
