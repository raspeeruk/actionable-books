  ### The Central Principle


  > "Relationships, families, businesses and organizations are defined by the
  promises people keep, break, and renegotiate."- The Promise Doctrine, page 10


  What the authors, Craig and Jason (father and son), discovered over their
  years of coaching, consulting, and training was that success for companies and
  individuals is based on one central principle:


  **Do what you say you’re going to do, when you say you’re going to do it.**


  It seems simple, but this philosophy encourages achievement, honesty, and
  teamwork in all areas of life and work, because it is based on personal
  responsibility. Most failures or breakdowns in quality, service, or
  performance can be traced to someone not taking personal responsibility for
  keeping a promise, whether to themselves or others. It is the foundation of
  achievement. And it depends upon the fusion of planning and doing. So to help
  you move forward, this book cannot be read without a pen in hand. The authors
  do all they can to help you make commitments while you’re reading so you can
  get started on your “Promise Journey”.


  _“The two most important words (translated into any language) in relation to
  personal responsibility are: I promise.”_


  Important words indeed. So, careful attention to when, where, and how you use
  them should be a major focus in your life. _The Promise Doctrine_ will guide
  you through understanding why promises are important, offer some examples, but
  more importantly, help you make and keep the promises that are important in
  your life (in other words, all of them).

  ### The Promise Doctrine


  > "If you have been looking for the ‘key’ to personal and professional
  success, here it is: Make important promises and keep them."- The Promise
  Doctrine, page 13


  _Craig and Jason explain the six elements of the Promise Doctrine as: Promise,
  Perform, Hurdles, Renegotiate, Trust, Celebrate._


  **Promise** – Be absolutely clear about what you are promising to do, and by
  when. For bigger promises that require a project, it helps to write down and
  track progress on milestones.


  **Perform** – Assess your performance and develop strategies to improve.
  Developing a habit of purposeful practice will increase your ability and
  results. Learn as much as possible to improve your strategies and approach.
  There are many good books available (especially on Actionable Books!)


  **Hurdles** – When obstacles arise, change your perspective of the situation
  and don’t automatically see a failure, but an opportunity to take proactive
  steps and overcome the hurdle. Time mismanagement and miscommunication are two
  of the major self-imposed hurdles. Asking for help is okay.


  **Renegotiate** – Being aware of your capabilities is the key for knowing when
  it is necessary to renegotiate your promises. When necessary, renegotiating
  the agreements you make is as important as promise making.


  **Trust** – Show up on time and be prepared. The more you keep your word, even
  for the little things (actually, _especially_ for the little things), the more
  trust you build, and your relationships strengthen. Can you make the phrase
  “Count on me” belong to you?


  **Celebrate** – Take time to party! Or whatever you do to recognize that
  you’ve made progress. Realizing how far you’ve come creates momentum to go
  even farther. Dream big to get energized. Don’t wait to acknowledge your
  achievements.

  ### Close the Gap


  > "Your personal and professional success is directly proportional to your
  ability to make and keep your promises."- The Promise Doctrine, page 34


  The authors call it “gap management” when they work with others to close the
  gap between ‘knowing’ and ‘doing’. “Many times people know what they should be
  doing, but for some reason (motivation, procrastination, limited resources,
  etc.) they don’t actually get around to it.” It usually comes down to a false
  perception of the final outcome and the largeness of it, that it is so distant
  or grand that we couldn’t possibly get there, so we fail to even start.
  Breaking goals down into a string of smaller promises will move you in your
  desired direction, continually making progress. This applies to specific goals
  or life in general.


  Use the tools that are available to help you manage your promises, but take
  inventory and simplify where possible. Creating good habits is the key to
  making significant change, and the main habit of the Promise Doctrine is to
  take personal responsibility.


  _“With the power of the right promises made and kept, we improve the journey
  that our lives take, the personal relationships that we form, and the quality
  of our work.”_
f_conclusion: >-
  If you want to just read something, pick up another book, but if you’re ready
  to improve your performance, reliability, trustworthiness, relationships, and
  be known as someone people can count on, then use the system outlined in _The
  Promise Doctrine_ to produce the new you. Good luck!

What was the last promise you made?

It probably wasn’t more than a few days ago, if not just this morning – whether to a co-worker, family member, or yourself, possibly about what you were going to do today.

If we make promises that often, then shouldn’t we take a closer look at how they impact our lives, and learn how to manage them more effectively?

That’s what _The Promise Doctrine_ by Craig and Jason Womack will do for you.

If you think about the people in your life who consistently do what they say they’re going to do, when they say they’re going to do it, those you can always count on to keep their word, it might be a short list. But think about the respect you have for these people and what they have accomplished in life. _The Promise Doctrine_ will help you become one of those people – because instead of just reading it, you have to write in it, and when you write in it, you start to live it. This book is quite different than most. With areas to write in, and pages that fold out, it’s more of a book that you experience than just read. Having a pen with you while you read is a requirement. The subtitle is a clear description: “A guidebook and system for consistently delivering on your promises!_”_
