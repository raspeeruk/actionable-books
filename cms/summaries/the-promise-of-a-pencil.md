  ### Leaders forge into the unknown so others can follow


  > "Joel showed me the essence of leadership by forging into the unknown so
  that others could follow. He taught me to approach each new person I met with
  the dignity he or she deserves."- The Promise of a Pencil, page 57


  In the sixth chapter, Braun shares one of the most influential stories in his
  ultimate decision to start Pencils of Promise. While backpacking in Central
  and South America, he met Joel Puac, a Guatemalan man in his mid-forties, who
  wanted to learn and teach English so badly he invited Braun to his remote
  mountain village.


  After listening to the man’s dream of educating his children and
  grandchildren, Braun traveled to that village and read aloud into “an
  old-school cassette recorder” the only book that Joel owned, a Christian
  Bible.


  As he watched Joel “forge into the unknown” of language study against all
  odds, Braun came to understand that the essence of leadership is _seeking_ a
  better future rather than merely observing present obstacles.


  Appropriately, the mantra Braun uses to title this chapter is “tourists see,
  travelers seek.”

  ### Make your life a story worth telling


  > "I realized that I needed to live a life that reflected the themes of the
  stories I wanted to one day tell, and when I veered off that path later on, it
  was time to make a change. Regardless of age or status, if you’re not
  satisfied with the path you’re on, it’s time to rewrite your future."- The
  Promise of a Pencil, page 251


  Again, Adam Braun’s primary focus is not to have us make our stories identical
  to his. Instead, he encourages us to make our individual narratives
  distinctive. To do so, he provides the following advice “for anyone going
  through a restless period in life”:


  *   _Start with an ambitious, but attainable goal._ Braun’s initial vision was
  to build a single school.

  *   _Change the subjects of your daily conversation._ Instead of talking about
  the life you’re currently living, speak the language of the person you’re
  becoming.

  *   _Realize the time is now._ Braun believes “the world has too many problems
  and you’re way too smart and capable to not help tackle them.”

  ### Re-create your reputation every day


  > "I assumed I could coast into the next phase based solely on my previous
  accomplishments. In truth we re-create our reputation every day. Journalists
  with thirty years of credibility have washed their careers down the drain with
  one plagiarized paragraph. I soiled months of good work with one lazy night."-
  The Promise of a Pencil, page 91


  By the tenth chapter, Braun has reached a low point in his narrative. On the
  fast track to a successful finance career, he desperately needed a promotion
  to qualify for an extended leave that would allow him to make Pencils of
  Promise a viable organization.


  Unfortunately, he tried to do too much at the same time. On one particular
  evening, he shortchanged a presentation for his employer because he was late
  to a Pencils of Promise fundraiser. His supervisor, who only knew him from
  this project, unapologetically blocked his path to promotion and Braun had a
  much more difficult time eventually securing it.


  Braun’s response to these events provides another actionable insight: Practice
  humility over hubris. Instead of lashing out at his supervisor, he praises him
  in this chapter for showing him that we must re-create reputations every day.
f_conclusion: >-
  In the end, we decide whether we make a positive or negative impact on the
  world. When Braun speaks of the extraordinary story waiting to unfold in each
  of us, I’m reminded of the final sentence in Tolstoy’s _Anna Karenina_: “My
  life now, my whole life apart from anything that can happen to me, every
  minute of it is no more meaningless, as it was before, but it has the positive
  meaning of goodness, which I have the power to put into it.”

  "These mantras have served as my guideposts as I’ve faced decisions both large
  and small. They have become my essential truths. I’ve written them with the
  hope that they will be carried forward, shared with others, and adopted in
  ways that will help you in your own journey as well."

I’ve written them with the hope that they will be carried forward, shared with others, and adopted in ways that will help you in your own journey as well." _\- The Promise of a Pencil, page 3_

We’ve all read books by accomplished individuals who tell their impressive stories in a way that basically comes across as “you really should be more like me.”

In _The Promise of a Pencil_, Adam Braun has an equally impressive story. At the age of twenty-four, he left a promising career in finance to start a “for-purpose” organization called Pencils of Promise, which builds schools and provides education throughout the world.

Braun, however, tells his story without any “be like me” braggadocio. Instead, he adopts a much more actionable, “be who _you_ can become” tone.

He does this by introducing each of the book’s thirty chapters with the mantra that helped him through that stage of his life. For example, he frames the chapter describing his parents’ influence with the mantra he learned from his father: “why be normal.”

This technique encouraged me as a reader to adapt these mantras to my own story or articulate new ones that help me find my purpose. To borrow one of Braun’s mantras, the book motivates readers to “speak the language of the person you want to become.”
