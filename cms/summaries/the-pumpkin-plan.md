  ### Find the right seed


  > "Don’t waste your time planting seeds that may or may not work. Plant the
  seed that you know has the very best chance of making it, and then focus your
  attention, money, time and other resources on that tight niche until all of
  your entrepreneurial dreams come true."- The Pumpkin Plan, Chapter 3


  It was news to me, but farmers gather every year in Niagara Falls to attend
  the Giant Vegetable Growers Convention. It is here where the prized vegetable
  seeds can sometimes fetch hundreds of dollars as they will produce the giants
  we see on the 6 o’clock news each Fall.


  Michalowicz correctly identifies, and I completely agree, **one of the biggest
  problems in small business – owners trying to please everyone.** Small
  business owners sometimes take on projects that are outside their area of
  expertise. Michalowicz explains that you need to really define your area of
  expertise and don’t stray from it – ever. He describes this right seed as the
  sweet spot – the place where your best clients and the best part of your
  business meet. When you figure out the one thing that you do really well, it’s
  like the right pumpkin seed.


  This is nothing new mind you…but he does an outstanding job of breaking it
  down in a way that helps you understand what the sweet spot actually is –
  **the intersection of your top clients, your unique offering, and your ability
  to systemize it.**

  ### The Tourniquet Technique


  > "The beauty of the Pumpkin Plan is that once you kill off the diseased and
  unfit clients and shift your attention to your most promising clients, you
  have the opportunity to cut all expenses that don’t serve your top clients –
  everything from phone lines to parking spaces. It makes cutting expenses so
  much easier. You can see what has to go and because you’re trying to grow a
  massive, prize-winning pumpkin, you have the emotional leverage to get real
  with your P&L and stop the bleeding. I call it the Tourniquet Technique."- The
  Pumpkin Plan, Chapter 6


  **Cash is the lifeblood of any business.** You’ll never make it if you don’t
  have enough – and most small businesses don’t. Michalowicz talks a lot about
  how we are always waiting to land the next client. “This next one will change
  things. I just need that _one_ huge client…” But the problem is that **_IF_**
  we land them, we run out and hire new staff, get a bigger office, a new show
  room, a new car… We spend what we earn, plain and simple. But when we run out
  of cash, the trouble begins.


  _The Pumpkin Plan_ requires you to cut the expenses that are associated with
  the clients that you just cut. Sounds easy, but it’s not because we are used
  to having an assistant, an office, the showroom, extra staff, and the support
  systems. Michalowicz gives you a few ideas to stop the bleeding; going through
  your profit and loss statement line by line is the most relevant. Taking a
  good hard look at every expense is key. Cutting staff, giving up the office,
  missing that national conference – really cutting costs is hard. But you must.
  Creating an org chart for each position is also valuable. This helps eliminate
  any confusion and helps establish roles and responsibilities.

  ### Cutting Clients


  > "More is not better, people. Better is better. You need to shift your
  mindset away from the quantity game. You need to stop killing yourself for
  scraps."- The Pumpkin Plan, Chapter 4


  As each chapter progressed, I bought in more and more to _The Pumpkin Plan_. I
  did have some difficulty with this one concept, but I believe it to be true.
  You need to stop wasting so much time on the clients who are high maintenance,
  who never pay on time (or ever), the clients who always change the scope of
  the project, and the clients whose calls you dread. Every small business has
  clients who drain energy and use valuable resources with little or no return.


  Michalowicz suggests that you use an Assessment Chart (which he provides) to
  identify your best clients. Fire everyone else! You can download the chart
  (and many other goodies) from the website –
  [www.PumpkinPlan.com](http://www.pumpkinplan.com/)


  A tough pill to swallow; talk about risky. I can see the value in this though.
  In a past business I owned, we fired a big client and it really worked. We
  dropped a client who represented a third of our revenues, but used about 80%
  of our resources. It was one of the most difficult but best decisions I had
  made as a small business owner. It allowed us to focus more on the clients
  that we enjoyed working with, and we were better able to service them. It also
  allowed us to generate sales and find more clients like the ones we wanted to
  work with. Michalowicz also gives you techniques to fire clients: **Eliminate
  services**, **prioritize service calls** (when good clients call they get
  serviced first), **raise prices**, and **refuse to two-time** – explain that
  you have an agreement with a major client that prohibits you from servicing
  them. These may sound harsh, but can be extremely beneficial.
f_conclusion: >-
  I really liked Michalowicz’s style. He likes to throw around some language
  that isn’t for the weak of heart, but he’s smart in the way that he drops
  F-bombs to make a point. He’s someone who I could easily see myself enjoying
  several beers with while discussing business. At the end of each chapter, he
  picks a business (Financial Planner, Artist, Tech services, etc.) and uses the
  Pumpkin Plan to revolutionize it. He does so in such a way that you can better
  understand the techniques and apply them to your own business. Whether you are
  thinking of starting your own business or have been in business for years and
  are stuck in a rut, _The Pumpkin Plan_ is a must-read.

  "Holy crap, I thought. Pumpkin farmers hold the secret formula for big-time
  entrepreneurial success. My get-out-of-jail-free card. The Holy Grail. The
  missing link. My Golden Ticket. (Yes, it was all of those things to me, and
  more, so much more.) There it was, in black and white...and orange. The answer
  I’d been looking for, for years. I needed to treat my company like a giant
  pumpkin!"

Almost every farmer grows ordinary, run-of-the-mill carving pumpkins. Similar to how almost every entrepreneur runs an ordinary, run-of-the-mill company. Imagine if you could change your ordinary company so that it got all of the press coverage and attention that the farms who grow those giant award winning pumpkins get? Mike Michalowicz’s _The Pumpkin Plan_ is the how-to book to walk you through it.
