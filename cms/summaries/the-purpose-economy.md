  ### Welcome to the Purpose Economy


  > "Much like technology a few decades ago, purpose has now become a business
  imperative."- The Purpose Economy, page 21


  Hurst believes we are in the early days of the emergence of the fourth
  American economy. I loved the cartoon he created to summarize thousands of
  years of history. Here is the text version.


  Humankind began as cavemen, wandering the wild with our families. We were
  nomadic hunter-gatherers. Life was tough. Food was scarce and the wilderness
  was dangerous.


  Eventually we figured out how to grow our own food and even sell the extra we
  reaped. Possessing land brought power. We entered the **Agarian Economy**.


  Machines were invented! This gave rise to cities and work in factories. The
  **Industrial Economy** was born. Workers punched the time clock and life
  became more comfortable with steady work and food on the table. The work,
  however, was often dangerous not just to the workers but the machines were
  destroying the environment.


  Then machines were invented that enabled us to work with our minds, not just
  our bodies in the **Information Economy**. But we lost something in that
  process. We began to lose connection with each other and the planet.


  People began searching for purpose in their lives. They longed for meaning and
  connection. **Welcome to the Purpose Economy.** The same technologies that
  disconnected us are now being used to enrich our lives and bring purpose.


  It makes complete sense, doesn’t it? As society evolves and more of our needs
  are met, we move up Maslow’s hierarchy toward self-actualization.


  The Purpose Economy is based on the fact that when people serve needs greater
  than their own, when they enable personal growth and build community, value is
  created. So by doing good, people and organizations do well!

  ### How do we gain purpose? Myth Busting


  > "TRUTH: Purpose isn’t a cause; it is an approach to work and serving others.
  Purpose is a verb, not a noun."- The Purpose Economy, page 101


  People gain purpose when they:


  1\. Grow personally  

  2\. Establish meaningful relationships  

  3\. Serve and contribute to something greater than themselves


  So how do you maximize purpose in your job? Realize that not everyone derives
  purpose from the same things. Then bust the myths that Hollywood has
  propagated. Most of the stories we see on screen give us a romanticized
  version of the role of purpose in our work. They create myths that make it
  hard for us to focus on the simple truths about purpose.


  What if I told you that I know a bus driver who demonstrates more purpose and
  derives more satisfaction from his work than some doctors. Huh? That’s because
  you can find purpose in any job. It’s all about how you approach it!


  For many people, seeking purpose is about finding a direction, not a
  destination. It is more about the journey. The satisfaction you derive from
  your work has more to do with you than the work itself. Do you choose to see
  your job as a challenging and rewarding journey?


  Here are the top 5 myths about purpose:


  **Myth #1: Purpose is a cause.  

  **Truth: Purpose isn’t a cause; it’s an approach to work and serving others.
  Think of it as a verb, not a noun.


  **Myth #2: Purpose is a luxury that only the rich can afford.**  

  Truth: Purpose is a universal need, not a luxury for those with financial
  status.


  **Myth: #3: Purpose will reveal itself.**  

  Truth: Purpose is a journey. It doesn’t ‘hit us’ like a revelation but rather
  comes from living life awake and seeking new experiences.


  **Myth #4: Purpose is derived only from some work.**  

  You can find purpose in any job. It’s all how you approach it.


  **Myth #5: Purpose is easy!**  

  Purpose requires giving of yourself. It will inspire and drive you to push out
  of your comfort zone.

  ### Is purpose really that important?


  > "In today’s world, running an organization without an intentional emphasis
  on purpose for employees and customers is like running an organization in the
  early 1990s and failing to implement technology."- The Purpose Economy, page
  22


  Aaron predicts that in 20 years, the pursuit of purpose will eclipse the
  Information Economy.


  If you are the type of person, who, like Wayne Gretzky, “skates to where the
  puck is going to be instead of where it has been” then take heed. Look around
  you. Think about where we stand in history today: our current culture, values,
  education, technological abilities, social organizations, political realities
  and the state of our natural environment.


  The public is changing their priorities and their desire is changing what we
  buy, how we buy it, from whom we buy it, why we buy it and how much of it we
  buy. Open any news source or check out the bestseller lists and you’ll find
  evidence of the change in priorities. There is shift from “business” to
  “business and society”.


  For example, Harvard professor and corporate strategist Michael Porter
  launched the “Social Progress Imperative”, a global index that strives to look
  beyond gross domestic product and provides a ranking of countries, based on
  how well they are meeting social and environmental needs of their citizens. It
  is one of many similar initiatives. In Canada, former Rotman School of
  Management Dean, Roger Martin, launched the Martin Prosperity Institute. It
  was designed to bring a business focus to the development of policy and a new
  way of thinking about economic growth.


  I’ve been working for the last decade trying to help the pharma industry serve
  differently, with more purpose, by focusing on the patient. Hurst’s insights
  show me that the people in our industry are not only ready to be purpose
  driven, but if they want to survive, they better figure it out fast! In fact,
  according to eyeforpharma’s 2014 Healthcheck survey, 81% of pharma leaders
  believe this is the path to future profitability. Purpose is where the puck is
  going.
f_conclusion: >-
  On a personal note, in my passion to help lift pharma I get frustrated when I
  feel things are moving too slowly. Hurst reminds me to focus on the
  satisfaction in the daily pursuit of that passion. And that feels good.

> "At the core of the Purpose Economy is people’s need and desire to find their own professional purpose." _\- The Purpose Economy, page 7_

Our economy is changing. Thirty-five years ago, Marc Porat coined the term ‘Information Economy’ and predicted the rise of Silicon Valley. Now, his nephew Aaron Hurst has observed that a new economy is emerging from the need for purpose.

Have you noticed it? Organizations that are thriving in this new economy deliver purpose to their customer, provide purpose to employees and build purpose throughout their supply chain.

In _The Purpose Economy_ Hurst describes, drawing upon his experience catalyzing the $15 billion pro bono service market, case studies, research and personal anecdotes, how the new economy is changing work to better serve people. It includes not just his beliefs, but those of 2000 thought leaders who contributed to the manuscript! How’s that for adding strength to his convictions!
