  ### Pursuit of A Higher Calling


  > "The Purpose Effect results in a higher calling, where individuals and
  organizations seek to improve society to benefit all stakeholders."- The
  Purpose Effect, page 7


  Certainly, there’s evidence that purpose drives engagement. Deloitte’s
  research in this area shows, “in those organizations where individuals felt a
  high level of purpose, 73 percent of the workforce indicated they were fully
  engaged whereas in organizations devoid of purpose, only 23 percent felt the
  same.”


  More importantly though, where stronger engagement that is anchored in purpose
  exists, stronger individual and organizational outcomes will occur. As
  Pontefract notes, “the authenticity that is rooted in such clarity of purpose
  in work motivates team members to greater effort and contributions.” When we
  believe we are working for deeper, more meaningful outcomes, we are willing to
  put in much more effort. Having worked in and with purpose-driven
  organizations, I know this feeling is unparalleled and drives a different
  level of output.


  We can’t ignore the benefits of purpose to ourselves, our organizations and
  the communities we serve. We just need to figure out how to get more of it.

  ### Leadership Is Key To Achieving Purpose


  > "…if a leader does not choose to create a trusting environment – one where
  team members might achieve purpose in their role and a sense of value while
  working – it is possible cognitive dissonance will overpower and the three
  categories of purpose might never align."- The Purpose Effect, page 71


  Many companies struggle with a disconnect between the “message from the top”
  and what people experience day-to-day. The same risk exists with the pursuit
  of purpose-focused work. Despite the best efforts to pursue purpose within an
  organization, there can be a difference between what employees hear about
  purpose and what they experience.


  Pontefract points to issues with leadership as a key impact that can prevent
  the Purpose Effect from being realized. Failing to provide fair pay practices,
  politics and power struggles, and unfair performance management practices such
  as stack ranking are just a few examples of the ways leaders can impact an
  employee’s interest and ability to pursue their best work. When those issues
  exist, purpose and a drive for a higher level of performance never have a
  chance.

  ### Get To The Sweet Spot


  > "The more alignment there is – the more a team member believes in the
  organization’s purpose and its relationship to their personal purpose
  alongside the role they occupy – the greater likelihood there is for an
  individual to reach the purpose mindset and thus the sweet spot. If this
  happens on a continuous basis, both the organization and the team member will
  have created The Purpose Effect."- The Purpose Effect, page 134


  It’s the alignment of key factors of purpose that get us to the level of
  feeling a deeper sense of purpose, a higher calling. Pontefract calls this
  “the sweet spot”, where purpose is realized in the alignment of three factors:


  **Personal purpose**: “_What motivates someone in life; their ‘why’_ … values,
  experience and beliefs inform personal decisions and actions”


  **Organizational purpose**: “_Why the organization exists_ … principles,
  ethics and culture inform its ways of operating”


  **Role purpose**: “_Why a role exists in the organization_ … an organization
  establishes a variety of roles to support its mission.”


  When individuals understand their own purpose and feel a sense of purpose in
  their role and overall in their organization, that alignment is the sweet spot
  that drives benefits from _The Purpose Effect_.


  From a company perspective, Pontefract defines the work towards purpose that
  organizations need to perform as “Good DEEDS”, which includes:


  *   **D**elight your customers

  *   **E**ngage your team members

  *   **E**thical within society

  *   **D**eliver fair practices

  *   **S**erve all stakeholders


  However, despite a company’s best efforts to deliver Good DEEDS, poor
  leadership can get in the way of achieving _The Purpose Effect_.
f_conclusion: >-
  It’s great to have this book to add to the conversation about deeper ways to
  improve the poor levels of employee engagement that exist in organizations
  today. Too often, we only hear about the “corporate ROI” from working to
  improve engagement, and fail to talk about the personal impact to people from
  working in environments that force them to leave their passion and values at
  the door. With _The Purpose Effect_, we can add a new dynamic to move the
  conversation forward about the shared ownership for engagement.

> "The Purpose Effect is a three-way relationship between an individual’s personal sense of purpose in life, the organization’s purpose and a person’s purpose in their role at work." _\- The Purpose Effect, page 4_

We spend too much of our life at work to not be able to have a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment from it. In _The Purpose Effect_ by Dan Pontefract, we look at the fundamental element of purpose in creating meaningful work experiences that engage employees, and the tangible and measurable benefits when purpose exists.

This book builds from Pontefract’s first book [_Flat Army_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/flat-army/), which emphasized the role of leaders in building great workplace cultures. In _The Purpose Effect_, Pontefract explores the shared ownership of great work, both with organizations that must commit to building roles and experiences that provide a purpose-based experience, and individuals who need to do the work in understanding and connecting to their purpose.

When key factors are aligned, there are benefits to purpose-filled work that make it worthwhile.

In case you think you’d be leading too far ahead of the curve in implementing purpose where you work, the range of examples included in this book, from IKEA to Johnsonville Sausage, prove every company can create purpose-filled work experiences for their employees, and in turn, realize significant benefits for individuals, the organization and their customers.

That’s a sweet spot to be in, if you’re willing to do the work to get there.
