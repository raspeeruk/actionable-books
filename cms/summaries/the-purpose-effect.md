  ### Purpose as a strategic advantage


  > "Purpose has moved from a ‘nice to have’ to a strategic business
  imperative."- The Purpose Effect, page xxi


  Dan Pontefract isn’t the first to propose that purpose is the secret
  ingredient of the most successful companies. People have discussed purpose
  since the time of the ancient Greeks. Remember Peter Drucker who said,
  “Business purpose and business mission are so rarely given adequate thought
  \[and it\] is perhaps the most important cause of business frustration and
  failure.”


  Aaron Hurst said, “In today’s world, running an organization without an
  internal emphasis on purpose for employees and customers is like running an
  organization in the early 1990’s and failing to implement technology.”


  And, it was Rick Wartzman who said that “building a deep and authentic sense
  of purpose could be a company’s ultimate competitive advantage.”


  When people believe in their company’s purpose (or what Dan Pink would call
  the big P) and can clearly articulate how their role connects to that purpose
  (or the small p as Dan would say), they achieve better results.


  There is abundant evidence to demonstrate the causal relationship between
  culture, purpose, engagement and bottom line. For example, a study by Queen’s
  University found over a 10-year analysis of more than 110,000 surveys,
  bottom-line benefits to an engaged workforce including:


  *   26% less turnover

  *   100% more unsolicited employment applications

  *   20% less absenteeism

  *   15% greater team member productivity

  *   30% greater customer satisfaction levels

  *   65% increase in share price


  People who consider themselves engaged at work are twice as productive, stay
  five times longer in their job, are six times more energized, take ten times
  fewer sick days, and help their peers 33% more.


  Deloitte LLP unearthed evidence showing that an organization with a culture of
  purpose creates confidence, short and long-term growth, as well as financial
  benefits.


  “Purpose is a better motivator than money,” writes Pontefract. “Money, while
  necessary, motivates neither the best people nor the best in people. Purpose
  does.”


  And to illustrate with a real-life example what the research shows, just
  yesterday, after I ran a Power of Purpose workshop with a group of pharma
  sales reps, a participant approached me and said “You likely don’t remember
  but I was in this same workshop last year. At the time, I was about to leave
  the company. I’m here today because of this session. I’m now driven by my
  purpose and loving my job.”


  “Wow,” I said, “that’s awesome! I bet your doctors love talking with you.”


  “Well,” she said with a big smile, “I have the top sales in my region!” Driven
  by her purpose, she was helping more patients, doing good and doing well.


  Data proves that both the organization and the team member benefit when
  culture and purpose are aligned. When the culture and purpose of an
  organization are such that the team member feels engaged and can demonstrate
  one’s own sense of role-based purpose, that’s when everyone benefits. Sadly,
  however, evidence shows that most organizations are still characterized by
  disengagement and lack of purpose.

  ### How do leaders make it work?


  > "You need authentic leaders who are able to model purpose and vulnerability
  and you need leaders who have the courage to look beyond short-term results."-
  The Purpose Effect, page 32


  If you are waiting for purpose to magically happen, give up. Creating an
  organization driven by purpose takes hard work and courage. It’s not enough to
  just put it in the company mission statement. It takes individual and team
  work and leadership. Purpose must be felt by people at all levels of the
  organization and the leaders have an especially important role in igniting
  this purpose.


  Leaders must have a long-term approach and invest in helping their people feel
  like they are making a difference. Think about the people on your team. How
  many of them have a job mindset (where they perform duties, in return for
  compensation)? How many have a career mindset (where they are interested
  performing such that they can advance salary, title, power, team size or span
  of control)?


  What you ideally want are people with a purpose mindset (where they are
  passionate, innovative and committed to a meaningful and engaging workplace
  that serves and benefits all stakeholders). What do you need to stop, start or
  continue thinking, saying and doing to model and nurture this purpose mindset
  in your people?

  ### The sweet spot


  > "Profit and purpose are not in conflict. The closer and tighter we focus on
  purpose; the more profit grows. The more we focus on profit, the less we
  make."- Mike Dejardins, DEO of ViRTUS, quoted in The Purpose Effect, page 158


  Where is the sweet spot when it all works? When a person connects the dots, or
  sees the alignment between personal, organizational and role purpose, that’s
  when the maximum outcomes will be achieved. Not only do they believe in the
  organization’s purpose, but that purpose is meaningful to them and they can
  see how their role contributes to fulfilling the purpose.


  A question for you: Do you see your work as merely a job, or do you feel the
  possibility of a meaningful experience?


  A question for your company: Are the decisions you make as an organization
  focused only on shareholder returns or on the best interests of all
  stakeholders?


  In both instances, if you answer the latter, you are more likely to achieve
  greater outcomes. The purpose of an organization ought to be, Pontefract
  argues, to “provide service to benefit all intended stakeholders.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Purpose is becoming increasingly important in today’s workforce. People are
  spending more time investing in figuring out their why. Achieving the purpose
  effect takes hard work, perseverance and an ability between the individual and
  the organization to achieve the sweet spot.

> "Purpose brings out the best in people and the best people." _\- The Purpose Effect, page xxii_

Are you ever frustrated that people don’t take initiative, or go above and beyond the call of duty, or bring their all to your team’s effort? 87% of organizations cite culture and engagement as one of their top challenges. And it’s no wonder: studies show that only 30% of workers in America consider themselves engaged at work and one out of two people at work simply “don’t care”.

What is the solution?

Pontefract shows us in _The Purpose Effect_ that connecting organizations and their people to their purpose is the answer. And there is a tremendous need for this. Research shows that 90% of workers are not connected to their purpose. Why is this a problem? Why should you care about purpose and how do you achieve it? We explore the answers to these questions below.

Purpose is becoming increasingly important in today’s workforce. People are spending more time investing in figuring out their why. Achieving the purpose effect takes hard work, perseverance and an ability between the individual and the organization to achieve the sweet spot.

Pontefract says it’s not impossible, but it is difficult. And this makes sense, doesn’t it? It is only those who dare to take this road less travelled that will reap the bountiful rewards of purpose-driven people and organizations. Will you be one of them?
