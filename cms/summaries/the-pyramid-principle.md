  ### Order Your Ideas


  > "Controlling the sequence in which you present your ideas is the single most
  important act necessary to clear writing."- The Pyramid Principle, page 9


  Your reader can only take in one sentence at a time. Therefore, you must think
  carefully about how to present the ideas in a logical sequence. To do this, it
  helps to separate the thinking process from the writing process.


  Imagine you are sitting at your desk and you get the following email from one
  of your team members:


  “I’ve been working on that report you wanted by Friday. I’ve realized that I’m
  missing some information. Bob has the figures I need but he’s not going to be
  back in the office until Monday. Also, I’d like to get Janine’s feedback as
  she has interviewed clients in a focus group and the summary will be available
  by Wednesday next week. If I include all of that information in the report,
  I’ll have it ready by Thursday next week at the earliest. Is that okay with
  you?”


  Your team member has used the process of writing the email as a way to think
  through what he is trying to say. You have to read through to the end to get
  the meaning – **the report won’t be available until next Thursday.**


  If he had taken a moment to think it through, the email might have read as
  follows:


  “With your permission, I’d like to send you the report on Thursday of next
  week, instead of this week on Friday. This will allow me time to include
  figures from Bob and the results of the focus group from Janine.”


  The point of the email becomes clear from the beginning, with a brief
  explanation to follow.

  ### Introduce Your Idea


  > "A good introduction does more than simply gain and hold the reader’s
  interest. It influences his perceptions."- The Pyramid Principle, page 49


  Minto proposes the following structure for your introduction: **Situation**,
  **Complication**, **Question** and **Answer**.


  **Situation** – something everyone can agree on.


  **Complication** – something that has changed, or a challenge or development.


  **Question** – the question that naturally arises following the complication.


  **Answer** – usually, your main message.


  Here’s an example of the introduction that I might use when sharing my ideas
  for the client proposal with my colleague:


  **Situation**: In our call earlier today, the client shared their objectives
  for the work.


  **Complication**: The client’s needs don’t match with our usual offering.


  **Question**: How can we meet the client’s needs?


  **Answer**: We need to create a multi-faceted proposal for our client,
  covering the course, customization and follow-up coaching.


  By starting with the **Situation**, you create the context for what follows.
  You also get alignment as the reader will recognize that what you say is true.
  Then you follow with the **Complication**. Your reader clearly follows your
  train of thought. The **Question** is not necessarily written, sometimes it is
  implied. In the example above, I may go straight from **Complication** to
  **Answer**, such as “In order to meet the client’s needs, we need to create a
  multi-faceted proposal including the course, customization and follow-up
  coaching.”

  ### Plan Your Pyramid


  > "The clearest sequence is always to give the summarizing idea before you
  give the individual ideas being summarized."- The Pyramid Principle, page 9


  By giving the summarizing idea first, we are using top-down communication and
  giving our readers the main message first. The main message is represented
  visually by the top of the pyramid and the key points and details that follow
  form the middle and base of the pyramid.


  To create the pyramid, use the following steps:


  1\. Make a list of the main points  

  2\. Work out the relationships between those points  

  3\. Draw conclusions


  To illustrate with an example: I was recently speaking with a colleague and a
  prospective client. The client was interested in booking a course with us;
  however their requirements meant we needed to offer something unique.


  I followed the three steps as follows:


  1\. My main points included the needs of the client and how that was different
  to our current offer  

  2\. The relationship between those points was the customization required to
  meet the client needs  

  3\. My conclusion was that our proposal to the client would need to cover our
  existing services and customization work


  After I followed the three steps above, I sent an email to my colleague with
  this main message: “In order to meet the client’s needs, our proposal should
  include the course, customization and follow-up coaching.” The rest of my
  message then went more into more detail on what the proposal would include.

Have you ever read a document and wondered “what’s the point?” How often have you given up reading an email because it’s too long?

**Many people write poorly.** They write long messages that are unclear. You don’t have to be one of them! If you’d like to write clearly and concisely, there’s help: _The Pyramid Principle_ by Barbara Minto.

Barbara Minto explains that writers should organize thoughts in a pyramid format, which gives structure to the ideas. She explains how this technique makes it easier for readers to understand the meaning; the brain naturally tries to make sense of new concepts in this way. By organizing ideas in a pyramid, writers do the hard work of figuring out the meaning and drawing conclusions and then write by putting the main ideas first. The readers then simply need to follow the clear logic and flow.

_The Pyramid Principle_ contains detailed explanations and examples of how to create your own pyramids to make your writing clear.
