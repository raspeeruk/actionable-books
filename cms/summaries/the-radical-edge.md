  ### Observe and Engage


  > "The only way to change the world is to be fully in it, my young friend."-
  William “Pops” Maritime, as quoted in The Radical Edge, page 22


  The subtitle to _The Radical Edge_ is “Stoke Your Business, Amp Your Life, and
  Change the


  World”. No small challenge, to be sure. Through three distinct stages of the
  story, though, Farber teaches how to do exactly that. It may sound
  overwhelming at first blush, but (and perhaps it’s a credit to Farber and his
  writing style) once you’re through the book, you feel equipped to take on all
  three – your business, your life, and the world around you. Farber teaches
  that small, steady, deliberate changes in your regular behaviour can have a
  dramatic (some might say “world altering”) impact on your life and the legacy
  you leave in your wake.


  One of the overarching themes of the book is the value of non-judging
  observation and appreciation of the world around you. As human beings, we are
  so quick to judge. We categorize, assume and stereotype just about everything
  we see, hear, touch, taste or feel. We often take the 80% of something that
  reminds us of something else and disregard the 20% that makes it truly unique.
  We forget that it’s in that remaining 20% that we can learn. Don’t judge.
  Don’t “think you know” what’s about to happen. Slow down your thoughts for a
  moment and work to appreciate the idiosyncrasies that make the people, places
  and experiences around you one-of-a-kind.

  ### Your Impact


  > "He held himself accountable for everything he ever set out to accomplish –
  and everything he ever set out to accomplish would, if successful, change some
  piece of the world he touched for the better."- ‘Edg’ in reference to ‘Pops’,
  The Radical Edge, page 39


  The benefit of the WUP exercise will (for most people) be twofold. One, you’ll
  gain a greater appreciation for the diversity of people, opinions and ways to
  experience the world. This unto itself will make you a better communicator, a
  better leader. If that wasn’t enough, using a WUP will also give you a greater
  awareness of opportunities all around you. Stepping out of your head and into
  the wide world of other people’s thoughts and actions will introduce you to a
  wider pool of need. People – consciously and unconsciously – share their
  desires and challenges all the time. The WUP allows you to collect those
  desires in one place for later reflection – a “connecting-the-dots” exercise,
  if you will. I truly believe that the simple act of carrying and using a WUP
  will make someone more successful – as an entrepreneur, an employee or human
  being in general. To quote Uncle Ben from Spiderman, though, “With great power
  comes great responsibility”. True leaders – the kind whose legacies live on
  forever – act in the best interest of their world. How you define your world
  is up to you, but all action you take should be with the intention of leaving
  that world better than you found it. That’s the sign of a great leader. So, as
  you ponder the findings in your WUP, do so with this question front of mind:
  “How can I use what I’ve learned here to make the world a better place?” Start
  asking (and answering) that question, and you’ll begin to realize a passion
  and excitement that’s hard to match.

  ### Truly Listen


  > "…scan and eavesdrop are basically just lookin’ and listenin’. Consider
  yourself both a scanner and a microphone. Again, you’re not making any
  judgements on what you’re seeing or hearing, just collectin’ the data that’s
  coming to you."- “Smitty”, as quoted in The Radical Edge, page 31


  One of the (many) good ideas from _The Radical Edge_ is the “Wake Up Book”,
  WUP for short. A WUP is simply a small note book that goes with you…
  everywhere. Think of yourself as a full time journalist, and the story you’re
  chasing is understanding the Human Condition. If something strikes you as
  interesting, regardless of where you are, write it down. No judgments, no
  action. Just write it down. The exercise is about opening your eyes and ears
  to the world around you, noting the realities that other people are
  experiencing. It’s so easy – so natural – to inject our own opinions and
  experiences into a situation. You see or hear something and immediately think
  about how you would respond in that situation. Forget about you for a minute.
  Be the unbiased scanner and/or microphone. Just record. There will be lots of
  time to think through the potential ramifications of your observations later.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are dozens of great lessons in _The Radical Edge_, and we’ve only
  touched on a couple of them here. The intangible value of this parable is the
  sense of fun you gain from reading it. The characters have a realness to them
  that allows you to connect more with the story as a whole. The lives they
  lead, and the camaraderie they share in their passion to change the world is
  exciting, inspiring and (best of all) duplicable. I encourage you to pick up a
  copy of _The Radical Edge_ today, and begin your own path to “stoke your
  business, amp your life, and change the world.” Have fun doing it, too.

_The Radical Edge_ is my favourite type of book. As author Steve Farber writes in his introduction, “I’ve jumbled the made-up stuff with the ‘real’ to the point that I’m not even sure where the facts end and the fiction begins. But that’s what made writing it so damn fun.”

Truly, that’s what makes reading it “so damn fun”, too; it’s a great story. _The Radical Edg_e is a story about leadership. It’s a story about passion, about the value of doing what you love, for people who you love and doing it in a way that resonates with your core purpose for being. It’s a story for business people and it’s a story for the rest of us. It’s a two hour read that I literally couldn’t put down until it was finished. (Which made for a bit of a bleary-eyed next morning.) And best of all, its message is simple.
