  ### Turns out.... we're all human


  > "Too many businesspeople - myself included, as Edg had pointed out - wanted
  to be invincible. They confused credibility with perfection and, therefore,
  would never dream of showing their scars and foibles to their employees."- The
  Radical Leap, page 24


  Yes, “LEAP” is an acronym, but it’s also a lesson in and of itself. Extreme
  Leadership (the only kind that matters these days) is about putting yourself
  out there. It’s about committing to a mission with passion and fervour.


  Too many “leaders” these days (and Farber spends some time discussing the
  woeful decline of the impact of the word “leadership” as it becomes just
  another buzzword) are polished to a point of ineffectiveness. You’ve seen
  these people – perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect smile, and the ability to
  run a thirty minute press conference without actually saying anything
  meaningful. So many people in senior roles have become so good at creating an
  aura of perfection that the thought of being seen as _human_ terrifies them.
  Sure, they wouldn’t word it that way, but what else would you call it when
  someone spends more time crafting 15 second sound bites than they do
  passionately pursuing their purpose?


  These people forget that we don’t follow “suits and smiles”. True leaders
  understand that leading by example – admitting that they’re human, prone to
  mistakes and fears, yet choosing to move forward _anyway_ – is what inspires
  the troops. Having a purpose – a passion and a vision – and committing to
  realizing that vision, is what gets people on board. One of the best ways to
  do that, Farber illustrates, is to embrace our OS!Ms: Our “Oh Shit! Moments”.
  (I told you he was edgy.)


  So what’s an OS!M? It’s the feeling you have as the rollercoaster crests the
  top of the hill and you look down at the track in front of you. It’s the
  sensation as you lean in for your first kiss. **It’s the point at which you
  commit** – when there’s no turning back – and you leap into the future with
  passion and purpose. And it’s as important in business as it is in the rest of
  your life. OS!Ms in business are when you stick your neck out for what you
  believe in. The polished people avoid OS!Ms. OS!Ms are messy; raw. There’s no
  guarantee of success. Leaders understand that there’s a power to that rawness…
  provided it’s used correctly.

  ### Technique is a bad word


  > "I had been lulled into thinking of this man as just a garden-loving,
  water-sipping, trailer-living, mellow and retiring Pops. But he wasn't. He was
  an empire builder. And, empires weren't built on a bunch of mamby-pamby
  'techniques.'"- The Radical Leap, page 56


  If you start thinking of Public OS!Ms as a great “motivation tactic”, you’re
  sunk. (And you should really read _The Radical Leap_, because you’re missing
  the point). OS!Ms, truly, are less about what you say, and more about how you
  say it. It’s about stripping away ulterior motives, “spin”, posturing or ego,
  and connecting with who you are, and what you believe at your core. Don’t
  think of it as a “technique” or “tactic”, but rather as a re-centering of you
  and your authentic self.


  The very concept of OS!Ms directly contradicts the notion of “polish”. Yes,
  you should be prepared. Yes, you can work on delivery and timing. And there
  are appropriate and inappropriate occasions for OS!Ms. But when it does come
  time for you to fess up and admit that you’re human, don’t think of it as a
  “technique”. Instead, connect with the moment and speak from the heart.


  I think the reason I have such a warm place in my heart for Farber’s books is
  as much structure as it is content. The content’s great, but it’s the
  characters, the story and the focus of each book that keeps me coming back for
  more. The Radical Leap is a fun read, highly impactful, and a great reminder
  that leadership doesn’t have to be complicated, but it does have to be
  authentic.

  ### Getting your OS!M's out in the open


  > "When you have your OS!M publicly, for everyone to see, you send a message
  that says we should all be doing this."- The Radical Leap, page 22


  If OS!Ms are good, **public** OS!Ms are better. Engaging regularly in that
  which stretches you is a positive exercise for you, but finding opportunities
  to share that stretch with your team will begin to develop a culture that
  encourages people to _commit_, and not to wait until things are perfect before
  doing so.


  As a leader, if you’re always looking for the exit doors, or calculating the
  “odds” in a situation, how can you possibly expect your team to be committed
  to the goals? Public OS!Ms are opportunities for you to demonstrate to your
  team that passion and commitment are more important than perfection.


  Don’t force it, but look for those opportunities to share more of yourself.
  When you start feeling that fear bubbling up at the thought of being quite
  that honest… that’s your OS!M. Take it. (but read the next insight first)

In the words of international best seller, Tom Peters, “_I am an unabashed Farber fan!_“. If you’ve read my articles on [The Radical Edge](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/the-radical-edge/), and [Greater Than Yourself](http://actionablebooks.com/articles/greater-than-yourself/), you already know that. Author Steve Farber writes with a wit, edge and lively pace that is all too rare in business books these days. In a word, the man is real. In _The Radical Leap_ – his first foray into the world of business books – Farber decidedly “shook things up”, choosing to weave his valuable, practical business advice into an engaging story in which he plays one of the lead characters.

_The Radical Leap_ (“LEAP” being an acronym for Love, Energy, Audacity and Proof) is the tale of Farber’s engagement with three unusual characters who, through story and interaction, teach him the importance of reconnecting with your passion for what you do… and how profound an impact that reconnection can have on others.
