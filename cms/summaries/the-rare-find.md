  ### Read Between the Lines


  > "The process of getting to know candidates is defined far more by questions
  involving ‘why’ and ‘how’ – and less about ‘what’ or ‘when.’ The payoff: the
  mysteries of motivation, fit, and potential become much clearer."- The Rare
  Find, page 63


  Resumes outline accomplishments achieved and job responsibilities undertaken.
  Some may stand out more because of what has been done or which organizations
  they are coming from. However, these lines of text may not tell the complete
  story of the person and, without a little more attention to the resume, great
  talent may be overlooked.


  There is a wonderful term highlighted in _The Rare Find_ – **jagged resumes**.
  It refers to people who have excelled in different roles, even though their
  resumes did not have all the right credentials. What they did have is what
  Warren Buffet calls “extraordinary temperament… an ability to stay calm in a
  crisis; the patience to do nothing at times; the willingness to absorb new
  information; the confidence to stick with a plan” (page 63).


  It takes extra effort to really understand what a person may bring in terms of
  talent to an organization. Some approaches that come through in the stories
  are:


  *   Read resumes from the bottom up to gain insights into a person’s story and
  character traits.

  *   Explore those elements that may show resiliency or determination.

  *   Study yourself and determine why you have been successful. Look for
  similar traits in others.

  *   Examine the capacity of a person to learn and grow.


  As Mr. Anders points out, finding the right people may require looking beyond
  just experience and involve diving in deeper to determine character. It’s not
  about finding people who are “smart.” In fact, having the right character
  attributes are more important, and may be the difference maker, in hiring the
  right talent.

  ### Discard Formulas


  > "How did individual insight become so endangered? Why do so many people
  think it’s safer to rely on formulas that miss the best candidates?"- The Rare
  Find, page 88


  When you read through the formulas organizations have in hiring people, it
  sounds more like how you would “pick out a lawn mower.” In the rigid formulas,
  what is missed is the ability to determine a person’s “motivation, drive, or
  potential.” Competency can be measured, to a certain degree, but other
  attributes need to be assessed through other methods. Think about it this way
  – we learn more about a person and their capabilities through an essay than
  through a multiple choice test.

  ### Out of the Normal Paths


  > "Is there a long tail of talent? Absolutely."- The Rare Find, page 128


  As mentioned, there are many stories in _The Rare Find_, which make it very
  valuable. One of the stories is about Facebook and their challenge of hiring
  many talented people as a very young company. One of their approaches was to
  publish programming puzzles for engineers to solve. The thought was if someone
  could solve the puzzle creatively and correctly, then this would be a person
  to interview and, potentially, hire. Since the puzzles were widely available
  through the Internet, Facebook was able to tap new, unfound sources of talent.


  The story unfolds from there, but it highlights how taking a different
  approach can tap talent where you would not normally look. Many companies look
  in the normal places – large corporations and well-known universities. There
  is not only more intense competition to hire talent from those sources, but by
  focusing on them exclusively, you may miss new sources that can be even richer
  in what they can bring in.


  There is a challenge with this approach. Looking in unusual places or at
  out-of-the-ordinary resumes leads hiring managers to think about what can go
  wrong rather than what can go right. To make it work, a mind shift needs to
  happen. If you are willing to remove the barriers from where you “should” look
  and make changes, like with the Facebook puzzles, new sources of talent may
  flow and your organization and team may benefit tremendously from the new
  talent found.
f_conclusion: >-
  In many ways, _The Rare Find_ is an unconventional read. The book adheres to
  its own advice of being a little different in exploring how to find and hire
  the right people. _The_ _Rare to Find_ does not follow an “11 chapter
  approach” that spells out a new principle in each set of pages. Instead, it
  tells the stories of individuals who have hired successfully, people who have
  achieved brilliantly, and organizations that have taken a different approach
  in finding talent to fuel their mission.
f_quote-2: >-
  "People with great reputations for attracting and developing talent regard the
  search for brilliance as their calling. They see themselves as discoverers,
  protectors, and builders of an entire discipline… They are cultivating a
  garden, not running a toll booth."

Finding the right talent for any position in any organization is a challenge. You probably have read about (or worked for) organizations that have tried personality tests, quantitative assessments, out-of-the-blue interview questions, and many other attempts to solve the problem of finding the right person to take on the open job responsibilities. Finding and keeping the right people are two of the vital strategic difference makers for any organization.

When I read about _The_ _Rare Find_, it sounded intriguing. Maybe in it there was something new to finally solve the hiring riddle. Although _The_ _Rare Find_ is very valuable, it does not necessarily spell out a new detailed formula to find the right talent. It does something much more important.

_The Rare Find_ tells stories about people and organizations and how they come together to find the right characters to help develop and further the plot. After all, everyone has a story to their career, so what better way to explore insights into hiring the right people than to use stories?

This is a book that will benefit organizations and individuals who need to hire good talent while inspiring people who may not fit the usual formula of the hired.
