  ### Purpose


  > "Think of Yourself as the Chief Meaning Officer"- The Real-Life MBA, page 17


  Jack and Suzy Welch struck a major chord early on in the book when discussing
  the topic of purpose and the role that a leader plays in communicating the
  organization’s purpose. This mentality is one that companies with healthy
  cultures understand. Their mission and purpose is very clear from the CEO all
  the way down to the front line employee. Per Jack and Suzy, “Leaders exist, in
  large part, to give purpose to their teams; to relentlessly, passionately
  explain, ‘Here’s where we’re going. Here’s why. Here’s how we’re going to get
  there. Here’s how you fit in. And here’s what’s in it for you.’”


  When you really step back and think about it, most people spend 40 hours a
  week for 40 years of their lives working. That thought right there is mind
  blowing in and of itself. If, as a leader, you aren’t helping your employees
  make meaning of that investment, you’re wasting their time and lives. This is
  the foundation on much of the leadership dialogue that takes place in the
  book. The discussion is always bringing it back to what’s the purpose of your
  organization, your team, and your people.

  ### Hiring 101


  > "You do have a hiring checklist, right?"- The Real-Life MBA, page 143


  Having leadership responsibilities usually means that you have some input and
  say in the hiring decisions that are made for your team and organization. As
  Jack and Suzy say countless times throughout the book, “Great teams start with
  great players”. That’s why hiring the right talent is so critical to your
  success as a leader.


  This brings us to a tool that the Welch’s live by when making hiring decisions
  – the hiring checklist. Simply said: “Good hiring checklists – are
  inextricably linked to your organization’s mission. Deeper still, they are
  linked to the specific skills and behaviors that you’ve ascertained will
  achieve that mission”. Here are a few recommended questions from Jack and Suzy
  to have on your hiring checklist:


  *   Make sure the list includes IQ. In today’s business environment, the
  playing field isn’t level. It’s titled toward the team with the smartest
  people.

  *   Personality matters. Even a bad one. Negative energy can infect your team
  and your organization.

  *   Check references!


  In short, whatever your process is, make sure you have one and that you
  constantly refine it over time.

  ### The Trust Dividend


  > "People may not always want to hear the truth, but they tend to trust the
  people who deal in it, demand it and display it at all times"- The Real-Life
  MBA, page 130


  In my work as an organizational development consultant, this topic of trust is
  often discussed through a leadership lens and rightly so. It’s the
  foundational competency that every successful and effective leader needs to be
  good at. Easier said than done through, right? Jack and Suzy, however, give us
  the easiest and best way to effectively build trust with your peers,
  subordinates or others that you report to. Simply listen. While I’m sure we
  would all agree that this skill is an important one, Jack and Suzy emphasize
  that it’s vital to listen, especially when it’s hard to do. For example,
  during a crisis, during an acquisition or during some period of uncertainty.
  By letting people share their thoughts and perspectives and reflecting on them
  genuinely, your people will feel that they have been heard. This will act as a
  “trust enhancer whose effects will last long after the crisis passes.”


  Genuinely listening to others will help you to build a more trusting
  relationships when done consistently and sincerely**.**

Whether you read the book cover to cover or use it as a just-in-time reference guide to addressing challenges and hurdles that you’re facing, _The Real-Life MBA_ is a great one to have on your bookshelf. I love the last line in the book, “Because work is great. It’s life. It’s what we do.” Reminding ourselves of this really pushes us to evaluate if what we’re doing is really what we’re “meant” to do.

Is your career giving you the purpose and impact that you want?
