  ### Build A Remarkable Business


  > "Many small businesses actually run, thrive, and grow based on figuring out
  how to do something better than everyone else in their industry, how to create
  a richer experience, how to deliver a better bang for the buck."- The Referral
  Engine, page 31


  The referral process starts, not surprisingly, with looking at every aspect of
  your business to ensure that the products and experiences you are creating are
  better than those of your competitors. Think about what differentiates your
  business from the rest, and then “figure out how to communicate the essence of
  that difference in the simplest way possible.”


  Jantsch emphasizes that **businesses generating the most buzz tend to be
  driven by purpose**, with leaders who communicate their unique view of the
  world. If you share your story with your customers and potential customers,
  they will likely connect with you on a much deeper level than before. Your
  uniqueness enhances the value you bring, and becomes a powerful
  differentiating factor for your business.


  “You must embrace the true value your organization produces and develop a
  referral system that allows you to bring the best of your authentic self to
  every opportunity.”


  Now that you have something for people to talk about, you’ll need to build a
  system and community around it.

  ### Create A Referral Community


  > "Nothing grows a loyal customer like a connection to something bigger than
  the product or service you happen to provide."- The Referral Engine, page 171


  Creating a community around your business, with your customers, strategic
  partners and others who may be connected to you, creates opportunities for
  referral conversations to take place, without you needing to ask. You can
  provide introductions, industry information, and updates about your
  activities, which extends the value you deliver and creates a reminder for
  them of the work you’ve done. Your community forum, whether online or in
  person, also creates a place for thanking those who have already made
  referrals on your behalf.


  **Your referral community also extends to your employees.** If employees are
  passionate about working for your organization, they will become part of your
  referral network, whether recommending your business to future customers or
  possibly future employees. Take some time to think about whether the employee
  experience at your organization is worthy of referrals as well.

  ### Every Business Needs A Marketing System


  > "Until you start looking at marketing as one of the core systems in your
  business, it will always feel like a disjointed and disconnected thing that
  you know you should do when you get around to it."- The Referral Engine, page
  53


  **Regardless of size, every business needs a marketing system.** For small
  businesses, Jantsch encourages looking at lead generation from a different
  angle, and focus on “being found” rather than finding your potential
  customers.


  Jantsch recommends analyzing every customer touch point, and building a plan
  for communicating at each stage. **Any opportunity to create connections via
  social media is encouraged, as “the most easily referred companies are
  naturally social”.** These connections need to be tracked and measured against
  outcomes, in order to determine the most successful channels.


  In a search engine optimized world, your unique value and point-of-view needs
  to come through in your content. Jantsch provides pages of ideas for ways to
  be more readily found, including through generating content in multiple
  formats, followed by the creation of spokes, both online and offline, which
  lead people back to your business.


  Once you have a system, you can start to build a community.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Referral Engine_ is full of great information, ideas and tips, and
  Jantsch makes it easy to see how the referral system can be developed in any
  organization. The book has given me the nudge I needed to be more confident in
  asking for referrals, by having unique value-added products, content and
  hopefully existing customers lead the way.

> "The ideal referral system, based on a strategy that gets people voluntarily talking about your business, can eliminate the need to ever actually ask for referrals again." _\- The Referral Engine, page 11_

I have never been comfortable asking clients for referrals or testimonials, as I’ve always thought if someone felt strongly enough about the quality of my work, they would be inclined to refer someone on their own initiative. According to John Jantsch in _The Referral Engine_, many business owners would agree with me. Jantsch, author of _Duct Tape Marketing_ and [_The Commitment Engine_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-commitment-engine/), found in his informal survey of several thousand small business owners, that while 63% said over half of their business is generated from referrals, 80% of that same group had no system for it.

Rather than sitting back and waiting for more than half of our customers to walk through the door, we need to establish a system that generates a high level of referrals on a regular basis.

“The lifetime value of a customer is unlimited when you factor in a customer’s ability to make referrals.”

Creating a system for referrals is critical, but first, you’ll need to check that your business is worthy of them.
