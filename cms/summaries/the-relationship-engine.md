  ### The Five Principles of the Relational Leader


  > "Customers no longer buy what you sell; they buy what you stand for."- The
  Relationship Engine, page 1


  The Five Principles of the Relational Leader are:


  1.  Display worthy intent

  2.  Care about people’s goals, passions and struggles.

  3.  Make every interaction matter

  4.  Value people before processes

  5.  Connect performance to a purpose


  Let’s zoom in on the first and last ones: displaying worthy intent and
  connecting to a purpose. “Worthy intent is the inherent promise you make to
  put the other person’s best interest at the core of your business
  relationship,” explains Wallace. Not only is this concept central to this
  book, it is central to your success. Adam Grant describes these types of
  people as Givers in [_Give and
  Take_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/give-and-take/) and
  illustrates how these people win over Matchers and Takers.


  When thinking about your worthy intent, it helps to connect to your purpose.
  Here’s the thing. People perform at their best when they have a clear sense of
  their purpose. Also, “People like to work with people they share common goals
  with!” That common goal is NOT for you to increase sales!


  What is your greater purpose? And how does it connect to your customer’s goal?
  I work in the pharma industry and teach pharma professionals to focus on how
  they can help the doctor create better patient outcomes. Clearly that is the
  purpose the pharma professional shares with the health-care professional.


  Unfortunately, most people miss the boat here and instead focus on their
  outcome—getting the sale—instead of the purpose (that results in a sale). The
  most successful people have figured out this mindset shift.


  Wallace lists five questions to help you articulate that purpose including:


  *   Who do I want to be?

  *   How do I want to be perceived?

  *   What am I here for?

  *   What is most important to me?

  *   What will my contribution be?


  A greater purpose can be found in any job. I was so impressed by our shuttle
  bus driver at the Phoenix airport. His greater purpose was to make his
  customers smile. He made more than double in tips compared to what his peers
  made and was significantly happier!

  ### 5 Ways to Sustain Great Relationships


  > "Purpose pulls profits along, the way a horse pulls a cart."- The
  Relationship Engine, page 93


  Now that you have figured out how to create great relationships, how do you
  keep them? Here are five ideas Wallace shares:


  1.  Always be intentional about relationships

  2.  Become great at observing behaviors

  3.  Respect at-will relationships

  4.  Power relationship capital through the five principles

  5.  Harness your relationship power


  As a practical example of how to apply this in everyday work, let’s look at a
  typical meeting. Research shows that while most professionals attend 61.8
  meetings a month, over 50 percent of this meeting time is wasted. So, as an
  intentional leader, to improve upon this, you can think of the acronym ‘POP’,
  which stands for purpose, outcomes and process.


  The _P_ involves defining the reasons for the meeting. It describes the
  specific work to be completed (the _what_) and the benefits to the
  participants when the work is completed (the _why_). You have a tremendous
  opportunity here to display your worthy intent by keeping the participants’
  interests in the forefront.


  Once you are clear on the purpose, you should plan the _O_, or outcomes, with
  which each participant will leave the meeting. This will also help you
  determine for whom the meeting is essential.


  Your second _P_ is for process, or the actual steps your meeting will follow
  to achieve the purpose and reach the outcomes. When planning your next
  meeting, try asking yourself and clearly articulating answers to the following
  questions:


  1.  Purpose statement (What are we trying to do and why?)  
      – We are meeting to… (What is the meeting about?)  
      – So that… (Who will attend and why will they benefit?)
  2.  Outcomes (What are the three things people will take away?)

  3.  Process (What are the steps we will follow to accomplish the above?)


  A final tip for meetings. Why not start them at 10 past the hour instead of
  the top of the hour? Knowing that people often struggle to move from one
  meeting that ends at the top of the hour to the next one, wouldn’t this
  demonstrate how much you value the other person’s time?

  ### From Acquaintance to Respected Advisor


  > "Every successful business relationship begins with and shares common
  goals."- The Relationship Engine, page 117


  When thinking about creating business relationships that last, picture a
  ladder. To climb this ladder from acquaintance to respected advisor, there are
  five rungs that include, from the bottom up:


  *   Establish common ground

  *   Display integrity and trust

  *   Use time purposefully

  *   Offer help

  *   Ask for help


  Each side of the ladder’s frame, or leg of the ladder, represents a specific
  skill set. On the one leg are the hard skills, or the ‘science’ of your
  approach. This is your product knowledge, expertise in the market, industry
  know how.


  The other leg of the ladder represents the soft skills or the ‘art’ of your
  approach. These are your interpersonal skills and behaviors like friendliness,
  approachability, communication skills, presentation skills, and emotional
  intelligence.


  If either one of these are weak, your ladder will be unbalanced. It really is
  a careful balancing act to get just the right amount of each skill set to
  climb successfully.

  Are you intentional about your relationship development? What do you need to
  do to move your business relationships forward? Just being conscious of it is
  the first step. So good for you! What will you do next?

> "Success comes from the experience we create for others." _\- The Relationship Engine, preface_

A recent study revealed that 89 percent of senior executives believe that relationships are key to their success. We all know that strong business relationships can make or break you. Why is it then, that so few people actually do anything intentional or systematic toward developing them?

Thankfully, Ed Wallace breaks it down for us in _The Relationship Engine_. He shares both empirical and experiential findings that smash the age-old belief that “you either have it or you don’t” regarding relationships. He shows us that there is an underlying process rather than randomness to building business relationships. He helps leaders and wannabe leaders see how the conscious, intentional cultivation of effective relationships is foundational to business success.

Below is a summary of his Five Principles that Relational Leaders employ intentionally to build and sustain relationships that create better outcomes. Additionally you will find a summary of the progression from acquaintance to respected advisor. And finally, five ways to sustain great relationships once cultivated. The approach he describes is simple and straightforward to apply, yet can be profound in its outcomes.
