  ### Be Responsible


  > "Know Your Impacts, Favor Improvement, Share what you Learn."- Daniel
  Goleman, as quoted in The Responsible Company, Chapter 3


  Everyone knows that they should be responsible and pay their bills on time,
  vote in elections and remember to take the trash out on Mondays. Chouinard’s
  idea of responsibility digs deeper; **becoming responsible is more than
  meeting your obligations.** He cites journalist Daniel Goleman’s advice for
  becoming responsible: “Know Your Impacts, Favor Improvement, Share what you
  learn.”


  You have to understand the results of your actions before you can implement
  improvements or share with others. This formula applies to situations outside
  of business, whether it is how you interact with your family, or picking a new
  hobby.


  In trying to be smarter about where you allocate your time, attention and
  resources, you are invariably choosing to not do something else. Still, the
  things you are actively choosing to do have a greater sphere of influence than
  just your decision. Constant optimization and selection of the best possible
  choices isn’t always an option. Fortunately, becoming responsible doesn’t ask
  such a high price. So long as you are trying to make smarter decisions when
  presented with a choice in the future, you can become more responsible. An old
  adage declares that, “you don’t really know something until you’ve taught it
  to another.” **Sharing what you learn solidifies thoughts and ideas for
  yourself as well as being the genesis for other ideas both for yourself and
  others.**

  ### Start Small and Large


  > "... it’s also worthwhile to look at what seems most difficult and
  far-fetched. What seems hardest to do, or boldest, may be precisely what you
  need to do to motivate others, including customers and competitors, as well as
  suppliers, to join you in your efforts. Checking off the easy stuff gives us
  experience and builds confidence. Tackling the big stuff, and surviving
  setbacks and failures, makes us smarter, stronger, and more useful to
  others."- The Responsible Company, Chapter 5


  Often with large projects it is easy to develop tunnel vision focusing
  exclusively on the end goal. However, Chouinard explains that **in striking a
  balance between projects big and small, you will achieve greater success.**
  You need to have multiple projects in the works. You need to have small
  projects that help to get you some quick wins and build some momentum. At the
  same time you need to have some monstrous ideas that get you excited. You need
  to strike a balance between short and long term goals. By accomplishing your
  small goals your larger goals are made possible.

  ### Lead An Examined Life


  > "It dawned on us that we really didn’t know how to make clothing
  responsibly, and we were failing as a business to lead an examined life."- The
  Responsible Company, Chapter 4


  Socrates explained thousands of years ago that the “unexamined life was not
  worth living.” Leading an examined life, or asking thought provoking
  questions, can help to know your impact. More recently, Chouinard explained
  that Patagonia, in its quest to become a better company, left some of the
  largest potential improvements untouched because they didn’t know the harm
  they were causing. He said that only through asking tough and uncomfortable
  questions was Patagonia able to learn the result of different manufacturing
  mistakes and begin to make a change. To continue to provide motivation to
  improve and to share with others, Patagonia now publishes a public report
  detailing its “full life and habits as a company.”


  The act of stopping and processing decisions alongside a result can help to
  more accurately weigh the true cost of an action. **If you stay late to finish
  a project what impact will that have?** Will you miss dinner with the family?
  What if you decide to sleep in since you stayed up late? That may reduce the
  likelihood of you getting in your run before work. These examples sound
  juvenile but asking questions and examining the answers helps to disclose the
  cost of decisions. The act of asking questions will not guarantee improvement
  or responsibility; however, the knowledge obtained through questions is a
  necessary precursor. Having the connections between cause and effect, or
  decision and impact, can help to favor improvement in the future.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Responsible Company_ prompted me to examine my life and question some of
  the choices I regularly make. I realized how much my seemingly innocuous
  decisions impact others. For example, by waiting to write this summary until
  tonight, despite having time to work on it earlier in the week, I am up late
  which might derail my morning run. **Our lives do not separate into nice
  little silos, there is tremendous overlap between work and personal, health
  and family.** Being responsible is about recognizing those connections and how
  decisions made in one area of your life will invariably influence the rest of
  your life. Being responsible is about trying to make smarter decisions based
  on past experience. Being responsible is a process rather than a destination,
  you don’t arrive but rather have to continually examine and improve which is
  why big and small projects/goals are so valuable as fuel for motivation.

> "We’re wasting our brains and our only world on the design, production, and consumption of things we don’t need and that aren’t good for us." _\- The Responsible Company, Chapter 3_

**The pace of change and innovation is increasing at an alarming rate.** Staying ahead of the curve requires constant progress and execution of good ideas. The founder of Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, believes that these ideas can originate from the least likely of places, in Patagonia’s case that place was Walmart. Patagonia learned that despite obvious differences, Patagonia and Walmart had shared concerns and constraints that could be better solved by working together.

While _The Responsible Company_ is intended to serve as a guide for companies to become more environmentally “conscious”, I read it mainly out of curiosity as to what makes Patagonia different as a company. I found the principles broadly applicable, not just to outdoor clothing manufactures or retail stores, but businesses large and small as well as individuals, and it all starts with becoming responsible.
