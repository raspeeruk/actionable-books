  ### Focus on the Problem


  > "Breaking the matter down, understanding your state of understanding, and
  keeping your mind free and purely focused on the matter at hand – not yourself
  – is the only way to strike the right balance between consideration and
  action."- The Right Kind of Crazy, Page 131


  Analyzing a problem is impossible when we are unable to focus on the problem
  itself. It is important to understand how everything fits together. Be
  curious. Break it into little pieces. Deconstructing allows us to see smaller
  details that may have been overshadowed by larger things. It also gives us a
  clearer idea of what we do not understand. Sometimes great innovative ideas
  distract from more sensible, simpler solutions. Steltzner mentions Occam’s
  razor; it is the economy of explanation that often reveals the truth. This is
  what brings us out of a state of confusion and gives us a clear direction.


  The idea transfers to working with a team. People are not interchangeable.
  There are many components of a team—the star players and many people with
  ordinary jobs—but the team also works with other departments. Be curious and
  broaden the focus. Central players are important but appreciate and understand
  how everyone works together. When managing a team, getting to know them is
  also important to understand how the job fits the project and the people.
  Fostering interconnection creates a safe place for inconvenient truth to be
  expressed and heard. Knowing a little truth that may be overlooked or
  unobserved can be the difference between success and failure.


  Clarity of ideas, resources, and people is important, but there are stumbling
  blocks that halt creativity and innovation. Our egos might prevent us from
  accepting new ideas and from sharing them. Read on to the Insights.

  ### Share the Answer


  > "Bringing all that you have requires offering up your opinion in the absence
  of invitation. It requires self-authorization. You need to believe that you
  have the answer, and you need to give it to the team, even if you only think
  you have the answer. It is a form of leadership, and it is needed at every
  level and in every element within a healthy and high-functioning team."- The
  Right Kind of Crazy, Page 49


  You do not need anyone’s permission to do exceptional work, nor do you need an
  invitation to share it. Steltzner writes, “What’s more, true authority comes
  not from a title or a position but because your words are well thought out, or
  at least strive to be.” You will be taken seriously if your ideas are well
  considered and well-articulated because they are useful. There is always room
  at the top for those willing to do the work and pass on their knowledge.


  Respect and encourage all team members. Steltzner observes, “Ideas should win,
  not people.” Feelings about an individual or desire for a personal victory
  should not detract from the matter itself. When you decide to contribute it
  allows your work to mix with others, and there is a synergy that makes a team
  stronger than any one of its components. Allow imperfection and support
  imperfect ideas and solutions. The need for perfection drives fear and fear
  blocks creativity and contribution. Respect is the glue that maintains the
  interconnection that makes it possible to achieve great things.


  The right kind of crazy is not insanity when the mind can no longer
  distinguish reality from fantasy. It is curiosity that drives discovery to
  define what part of fantasy can be a reality. Discovery does seem crazy until
  it becomes innovation and eventually ordinary, even mundane. Perhaps this is
  why those with an aptitude for creativity find a little magic in everyday
  life, challenge what is accepted and create what has never been before.

  ### Surrender the Ego


  > "And there is a virtue in staying in the Dark Room until you completely
  surrender—not give up but completely surrender the ego, which means that you
  stop trying to force the existing solution. That’s when a breakthrough can
  occur."- The Right Kind of Crazy, Page 114


  Our ego is our sense of self, and it is the mechanism for how we adapt to the
  world and build our model of it. Peppered with a measure of curiosity, we can
  look beyond our narrow field of observation from which we created our ego.
  Observation is the weakest form of evidence. Empirical data is something like
  an observation on steroids. Facts are essential and inseparable from the
  problem, but not the whole truth. To find a solution, we must include our
  judgment, a product of our model of the world. By releasing our ego, our
  analysis improves, and solutions materialize. It is only in the dark when we
  feel lost; we can surrender. In the light, reality supports our beliefs, and
  there is no need for submission.


  Surrendering our ego also releases panic and opens the mind. Our panic is our
  ego protecting itself, working to preserve the world it created. People who
  can stay calm in chaos are not trying to control the situation, they are
  observing it so they can adapt. When our ego is too tenacious, we force the
  solution that fits with our view of the world. Our view is only a model of
  reality and a judgment made based on the model may not work in reality. In a
  state of panic, the most desperate solution in our world will seem to be the
  only choice. Steltzner offers the acronym HOTTD – hold on to the doubt.

  "We humans are an innately curious species. Born through hips too narrow to
  pass a skull large enough to hold a fully formed human brain, we are born
  half-baked. Compared with those other animals, very few of our behaviors are
  hardwired. We don’t inherit genetic instructions for nest building, for
  instance, or for migrating south when the sun hits a certain angle in the sky.
  We come into this world programmed with few instructions, save for one
  paramount piece of code: Be curious."

> "We humans are an innately curious species. Born through hips too narrow to pass a skull large enough to hold a fully formed human brain, we are born half-baked. Compared with those other animals, very few of our behaviors are hardwired. We don’t inherit genetic instructions for nest building, for instance, or for migrating south when the sun hits a certain angle in the sky. We come into this world programmed with few instructions, save for one paramount piece of code: Be curious." _\- The Right Kind of Crazy, Page 227_

In _The Right Kind of Crazy,_ Adam Steltzner (with William Patrick) takes us on an autobiographical journey of how he ultimately lead the team at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that developed the Sky Crain that put NASA’s _Curiosity_ on Mars. In _The Right Kind of Crazy_, Steltzner explores how curiosity steered him toward self-authorization, overcoming the fear of failure, embracing imperfection, balanced judgment, managing stress with grace, and a style of leadership focused on interconnection, all of which opened up incredible opportunities and achievements. This book is about how curiosity transforms life.

Curiosity is the antidote to misinformed conclusions about other people, our world, even ourselves. We rely on data that we filter through our perspective. A perspective is our model of the world, and curiosity is the bridge to other models. The more we consciously seek out and accept other views, the more strictly our opinion matches reality. As we get closer to reality more possibilities open up; solutions and discoveries materialize.

Steltzner uses similar principles for leadership and problem-solving. For this summary, I will focus on problem solving but also include how that applies to working within a team. It is not enough to know the answer, we must share the valuable information.
