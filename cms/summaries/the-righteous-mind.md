  ### Morality is broader than we think


  > "Moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence, or
  even existence, of other matrices. This makes it very difficult for people to
  consider the possibility that there might really be more than one form of
  moral truth..."- The Righteous Mind, page 130


  When western liberals think about morality, they tend to consider only a
  couple of different dimensions (what Haidt calls “matrices”), specifically
  whether something causes harm and if it’s fair. Haidt argues that these are
  just two of six “matrices”—and that the people (western liberals) who focus on
  these two are in the vast minority globally. He uses the metaphor of taste
  receptors and the palate of tastes—sweet, sour, bitter, etc. to suggest that
  there is an equally rich palate of considerations that go into whether people
  consider something moral.


  The “candidates” for these receptors or matrices are: care, fairness, loyalty,
  authority and sanctity.


  Put this together with what you will momentarily read about in insight #1 and
  you’ll realize that our moral intuitions—especially if we are not western
  liberals—are likely to also be formed because of a sense of disloyalty or
  loyalty, respect or disrespect of authority or as either upholding or
  degrading sanctity. If you happen to be a western liberal (in full
  transparency, a category I fit into perfectly,) you’re far more likely to
  focus only on whether something causes harm—or whether something is fair or
  just.


  By ignoring the palate of moral receptors, Haidt claims that western liberals
  don’t understand what makes others, unlike them, tick. At the same time,
  conservatives, who tend to operate with a broader moral palate, might
  underestimate the depth of conviction around care and harm that drives the
  liberal mind. The mix creates for distrust, misunderstanding, and
  partisanship.


  Haidt also points out that western liberals are the outliers—strongly
  suggesting that liberals must see the broader palate to have greater influence
  in political discourse.

  ### We are both chimp and bee


  > "An organization that takes advantage of our hivish nature can activate
  pride, loyalty, and enthusiasm among its employees and then monitor them less
  closely."- The Righteous Mind, page 275


  Experiments have shown that human toddlers are able to succeed on challenges
  that are social in nature where chimps simply can’t—while, with tasks that are
  not social in nature, the chimps and toddlers achieve similar results. In
  fact, humans veered from other primates when they developed “shared
  intentionality”—the ability to share a task—to truly work together. This was
  the beginning of “groupishness.”


  While we are 90% chimp—meaning that we are very much shaped by competition
  leading to looking after our self-interest—we are 10% bee. Bees are
  “ultrasocial” and we, too, have an ultrasocial overlay. Our ultrasocial nature
  was shaped by competition of groups with other groups. In order to survive we
  had to transcend our selfishness and turn on the “hive switch” at which point
  we entered an “all for one, one for all” mind-set—where the good of the group
  trumped the good of the individual.


  We can use this recognition that we are not just chimp, but also bee—for good.
  Organizations are often run on the underlying premise that people are all
  chimp—after their self-interest alone. We design systems of carrots and sticks
  to get the results we want. We don’t tap into our social nature to create
  organizations that in which “hivish employees work harder, have more fun, and
  are less likely to leave the company.”


  Haidt offers practical suggestions here that include creating a sense of
  common values and identity, give people opportunities to play together
  (literarily to move together,) and to focus on creating group—not
  individual—competition.

  ### Intuition first—reason second


  > "If you want to change people’s minds, talk to the elephant first."- The
  Righteous Mind, page 57


  One of Jonathan’s Haidt’s best-known metaphors, first explored in a previous
  book and expanded here, is that of the elephant and the rider. This book
  expands and deepens that metaphor. The mind is divided into parts—the rider
  being the “controlled processes” and the elephant being the “automatic
  processes.” The rider evolved to serve the elephant.


  This means that when we have a moral intuition (our elephant at work), we will
  quickly engage the rider to justify that intuition, to provide reasoning for
  it. Our analytical justifications are there to explain what we intuitively
  sensed. It’s hard to get us to change our minds with reason and analytical
  arguments. And, we’re so good at this that our riders will work diligently to
  justify any position that our elephants take.


  The way to change minds and influence people is by speaking to the elephant
  first.


  Much of what we do, in day to day life, is precisely the opposite. We argue
  and reason with the rider—and very little changes and shifts. While I’m still
  working on what it means to talk to the elephant, I’m sure that the first step
  is recognizing the power of the elephant and seeing my own elephant and rider
  at work.
f_conclusion: >-
  My favorite books are the ones that challenge things I assume are true and
  help me see the world I live in through different eyes. In particular,
  Jonathan Haidt’s book helped me see opinions and views that I typically
  reject—especially those grounded in moral intuitions—with greater openness.

> "Politics and religion are both expressions of our underlying moral psychology, and an understanding of that psychology can help to bring people together." _\- The Righteous Mind, page xiv_

Jonathan Haidt opens _The Righteous Mind_ by invoking Rodney King’s question, “Can we all get along?” From there, using research representing a wide range of fields including psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, anthropology and behavioral economics, he dives deep into all that lies behind this deceptively simple question.

How do we develop our sense of morality? What is the relationship between the rational and the emotional—what role does intuition play in morality? What dominates our morality—the individual or the collective? Why do different people (especially liberals and conservatives) hold such a vastly different sense of what’s right and what’s wrong—and why are each sure that they are right?

This is a book full of exciting ideas, fascinating studies and great writing. Most of the way through the book I found myself reading aloud to anyone willing to listen! Here are just a few takeaways—things that struck me as meaningful.
