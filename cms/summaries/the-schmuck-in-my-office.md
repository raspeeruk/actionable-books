  ### No one WANTS to be disruptive


  > "These descriptions are not meant to lead you to overdefine or pigeonhole
  the people around you—they are simply presented to guide you in understanding
  and handling aspects of your relationships with them. Perhaps most important,
  in beginning to understand people, you can feel more empathy for their
  situations and why they may act as they do."- The Schmuck in My Office, page 9


  As Dr. Foster repeatedly states, the goal of the book is never to diagnose and
  treat issues, but to help us understand the diverse types of dysfunction that
  may be present in the workplace and some of the factors that lead to it. The
  reader is not to bring the book to work and label people or issues, but,
  rather, through a series of examples we can try to understand and begin to
  identify ways to better interact and engage with one another.


  The types of Schmucks are:


  *   **The Narcissus** – someone with an over-developed sense of entitlement,
  who is self-centered, condescending, and attention seeking.

  *   **The Venus Flytrap** – someone who is over-dramatic and inconsistent in
  reaction, and keeps everyone on edge.

  *   **The Swindler** – someone who comes across as “slick” and manipulative.

  *   **The Bean Counter** – someone who is so obsessed with order or perfection
  to such a degree that they cannot handle not being in total control.

  *   **The Distracted** – someone who is constantly focused on everything else
  but their work, and who struggles with procrastination.

  *   **Hyde** – someone who has a completely different personality and one that
  is the opposite of their usual behavior (similar to an addict in that
  respect).

  *   **The Lost** – someone who exhibits memory loss, loss of language or even
  judgement skills.

  *   **The Robotic** – someone who appears unemotional or hard to read and just
  can’t connect with others.

  *   **The Eccentric** – someone who has difficulty relating to others because
  of their own view of the world, one which others may find odd.

  *   **The Suspicious** – someone who is constantly feeling that there is a
  conspiracy against them and alienates others via paranoia.


  The reality is that this list contains elements that are often outside of the
  person’s control—some factors are biological, environmental, or even cultural.
  While none of these are inherently bad, if they aren’t kept in check they can
  manifest into larger and potentially more serious issues.


  The other point that Dr. Foster brings up is that often the problem may lie
  with us, in our inability to understand others and ourselves, and that may
  cause the stress and anxiety that creates the dysfunction. Therefore, before
  we assume the issues we may face are someone else’s fault, we need to turn
  inward and look in the mirror.

  ### Communication is key


  > "Workplace relationships are just another type of relationship between
  people, and they need to be built on openness and communication. We need to be
  honest with ourselves and with each other."- The Schmuck in My Office, page
  303


  Regardless of which type of disruptive behavior you are seeing, according to
  Dr. Foster the critical element is clear and consistent communication. This
  may be done upfront with expectations laid out and standards of conduct that
  are clearly defined, in a way that no one can claim they were not aware, and
  as such can have no excuses. Other suggestions include direct conversations
  with a focus on the behavior and resulting impact, not only on the business
  but on all effected parties. Tactics include everything from simple
  conversations, casual coffee meetings and discussions, to the more formalized
  documented meetings with mangers and HR, to even medical/psychiatric
  interactions depending upon the magnitude of the workplace issue. For some,
  the direct approach is welcome, and for others it may only fan the flames and
  increase the tension. Regardless, effective communication, either in verbal or
  written form, solidifies the need to be clear for all parties to be
  successful.

  ### Do something


  > "Avoiding a pattern of behavior will not cause it to magically disappear but
  will instead allow it to fester."- The Schmuck in My Office, page 27


  As with any problematic behavior or situation, the most important thing we can
  do is act—but not just act, but as quickly and as close to the initial
  occurrence of the behavior as possible. Too often there is a fear of
  confrontation, even a hope that things will blow over or correct themselves,
  but this usually leads to an increased level of frustration for everyone. The
  person who displays the disruptive behavior may not even be aware there is an
  issue, and those who see it and know that nothing is being done about it begin
  to lose trust in the organization.


  If the disruptive behavior is serious and dangerous, then immediate action is
  critical, whereas if the behavior is of a less-serious nature (even merely
  inconvenient or unpleasant) a more moderate action is appropriate. Again, the
  key is confronting the offending behavior and working towards a solution. The
  behavior is what needs to change, and the focus needs to be on that instead of
  the individual.
f_conclusion: >-
  Considering the title of the book, you might expect that _The Schmuck in My
  Office_ would be cheeky and full of somewhat humorous advice, but it contains
  helpful information for anyone who deals with people and wants to be
  successful. Through clear and useful examples, Dr. Foster creates an essential
  handbook that provides clinical background and insights into factors that
  create interpersonal tension and the impacts that it can have in our
  organizations.

In _The Schmuck in My Office: How to Deal Effectively with Difficult People at Work_, Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and author Dr. Jody Foster has put together a tremendous resource of both clinical and practical experience in dealing with behavioral and personality dysfunction, and ties this into many workplace situations. The title of the book grabbed my attention and made me want to read it, in the hope of better understanding the types of people I have worked with in the past, and what I could have done better in my dealings with them. The book, though, gains its power and effectiveness not from identifying problematic behaviors and the different people who exhibit them, but rather from its ability to open our eyes to the potential influences that drive workplace discord.
