  ### Master your body


  > "Greatness isn’t about working a lot or making a lot of money. It’s about
  having purpose and being the best that you can possibly be."- The School of
  Greatness, page 127


  Foundationally, in order to be successful in anything that we do we must be
  healthy enough to actually do it. Our health affects our ability to be good
  parents, partners, friends, clients, leaders, etc. Yet while we inherently
  know this, taking care of our bodies is one of those things that we often
  brush off because of how “busy we are”. There’s a great quote in the book from
  Richard Branson who was “asked for his best piece of advice. His answer was
  one word: exercise. Why? Because if you don’t take care of yourself, you can’t
  take care of your business.”


  An often overlooked topic when it comes to health is our brain health. Lewis
  interviewed a leading American psychiatrist, Daniel Amen who said, “Your brain
  is literally involved in everything you do. How you think, how you feel, how
  you act, how you get along with other people, and when it works right, you
  work right. When it’s troubled, though, for whatever reason – toxic exposure,
  head trauma, drug abuse, lack of oxygen – that’s when you start getting
  sadder, sicker, poorer, less successful.”

  ### Working harder and smarter


  > "The best hustlers are all underdogs. Even if they’re not, they view
  themselves that way."- The School of Greatness, page 102


  This insight is at the root for all of those who are “successful” and it’s no
  surprise Lewis addresses it in _The School of Greatness._ Anyone who is good
  at anything was once a beginner at it. They had to learn their craft, work to
  hone it and continuing growing over a period of time to refine it. In our
  world of instant gratification, the fact that it takes time to become great at
  something is completely disregarded. Most of us get worked up when we aren’t
  good at something right off the bat. We may fear looking back, we probably run
  through a litany of what-if scenarios in our heads and ultimately become
  disappointed because we aren’t world class the first time we try something.


  Lewis give us some good coaching advice in saying “when you experience fear,
  move toward it. When you feel doubt, take the necessary actions to build your
  confidence. When you are afraid of being wrong or looking bad in front of
  others, be humble and vulnerable to create real human connection.” The hustle
  requires action and all you have to do is just start.

  ### Practice positive habits


  > "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a
  habit."- The School of Greatness, page 154


  I absolutely love the above quote from Greek philosopher, Aristotle. Simply,
  our habits define us. When you look at them individually doesn’t seem all that
  critical; it’s when you take them in combination or as a whole that they
  become incredibly powerful.


  It’s important to evaluate what good and bad habits you currently have. It’s
  even more important to decide what good habits that you want to adopt as well.
  Without knowing which habits will help you achieve your goals and who you want
  to be, it’s unlikely that you’ll get there. Every habit you have either
  helping you towards your dreams and holding you back from reaching them.


  As Howes writes in his coaching tip for practicing positive habits, “it’s time
  to step up and get serious with you daily actions, as this is what builds the
  momentum in your life towards the vision you want to achieve.”

  “We are only as good and as strong as our adversity makes us,” Howes reminds
  us.

> "What The School of Greatness is going to teach you is, first and foremost, what is great and special about you" _\- The School of Greatness, page XIX_

I first came across Lewis Howes, author of _The School on Greatness_, via his podcast a number of years ago. Lewis would interview (and still does) big timers in business, athletics, authors, etc. and each episode was a gold mine! Fast forward a few years, now comes his bestselling book _The School of Greatness_, which at a high-level is a compilation of the amazing insights from his podcast guests.

Lewis Howes, among being an author and podcast host, is a lifestyle entrepreneur, speaker, business owner, and pro athlete! In his book, he shares with us tips, insights and habits from “the greats” he’s had on the podcast which cover the following topics: Creating a vision, turning adversity into an advantage, cultivating a champion’s mindset, developing hustle, and living a life of service.

What I love most about this book is its informal flow. I felt like I was listening to Lewis speak while reading it. Each chapter begins with a “get grounded” paragraph which sets the tone for the context of what is going to be read and finishes up with a “coaching tip” which leaves you with some actionable takeaways and motivation as you wrap up.
