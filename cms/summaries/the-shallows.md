  ### Dive deeper


  > "The Net's interactivity gives us powerful new tools for finding
  information, expressing ourselves, and conversing with others. It also turns
  us into lab rats constantly pressing levers to get tiny pellets of social or
  intellectual nourishment."- The Shallows, page 117


  The issue is not information overload. There has always been more information
  available than a single person could consume. Carr believes the issue is that
  our always connected state is “chipping away at \[our\] capacity for
  concentration and contemplation.” He explains: “once I was a scuba diver in a
  sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.”


  Carr does not advocate a digital monk lifestyle with Internet abstinence.
  Rather he encourages us to determine what the true costs of the benefits that
  are offered by relying on the Internet.


  We must learn to balance the rapid discovery and retrieval of information made
  possible by the Internet with the depth and analysis required by longer forms
  of reading traditionally found in books. Yes, you will still spend time on the
  Internet, it is here to stay. There are several benefits to using it as a tool
  to simplify information gathering and connecting with others. However, try to
  supplement your screen time with an additional physical book or two. Diving
  deeper into a book results in more of a “replenishing of the mind” than a
  tweet or a blog post can offer.


  Carr explains: “The words in books \[not only\] strengthen people’s ability to
  think abstractly; they \[enrich\] people’s experiences of the physical world.”

  ### Create your commonplace


  > "We should imitate bees and we should keep in separate compartments whatever
  we have collected from our diverse reading, for things conserved separately
  keep better. Then, diligently applying all the resources of our native talent,
  we should mingle all the various nectars we have tasted, and then turn them
  into a single sweet substance, in such a way that, even if it is apparent
  where it originated, it appears where it originated, it appears quite
  different from what it was in its original state."- Seneca, The Shallows, page
  179


  While memorizing and deep cognitive processing are not en vogue they remain
  beneficial, even to our Internet adapted brains.


  The Dutch Philosopher, Erasmus, advocated that everyone keep a notebook
  organized by subject that he called a “Commonplace.” In this record he
  encouraged students and teachers to note based upon their reading and
  observations “occurrences of striking words, archaic or novel diction,
  brilliant flashes of style”. With these annotations he encouraged the owners
  to review them, to memorize, and work to digest their notes. The value in
  creating such a work is in the connections made between seemingly disparate
  entries. While Google may be able to scan millions of web sites in seconds, it
  cannot make the connections between that passage of _How to Kill a
  Mockingbird_ you read in high school and your decision to attend law school.

  ### Choose to take a break


  > "We usually make better decisions... if we shift our attention away from a
  difficult mental challenge for a time."- The Shallows, page 119


  While the author does not advocate for a permanent off the grid approach,
  unplugging now and then is beneficial when you’re stuck in a rut. A Dutch
  study found that taking periodic breaks permits the “unconscious mind time to
  grapple with a problem, bringing to bear information and cognitive processes
  unavailable to conscious deliberation.”


  We need to learn self-control and step away, allowing ourselves a break. We
  need to make the decision because “We are forever inundated by information of
  immediate interest to us – and in quantities well beyond what our brains can
  handle.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Reading _The Shallows_ has confronted me with a number of questions about my
  own Internet use and its long-term costs. In an effort to consciously
  “unplug”, I tried scaling back my social media consumption by only checking in
  on Mondays. I have also tried to not always be listening to something, even if
  it is a podcast or an audiobook. While traveling to and from work or classes
  for the last few years I’ve listened to audiobooks or podcasts and always
  thought I was being so efficient because I thought I was always learning
  something new. Now, I still read/listen a lot, however, I try to give myself
  more time to intellectually digest and process what I am learning before
  immediately moving on to the next item in my queue.

We have immediate access to more information than any other time in history. The Internet allows for greater connectivity, instant links to related information, and searching capabilities that greatly facilitate research.

But at what cost do all of these benefits come?

Journalist Nicholas Carr, author of _The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains_, explains that the Internet is similar to previous information technologies like maps, mechanical clocks or printed books. Each of these mediums, when first introduced, changed the way our brains handled information. As each technology rose to prominence, “some cognitive skills” were developed “at the expense of others.” Carr says that “every tool imposes limitations even as it opens possibilities.” He goes on to explain that “the more we use” a particular tool “the more we mold ourselves to its form and function.” With that framework in mind, what then is the increasingly ubiquitous Internet doing to us?

### Create your commonplace

Now, I still read/listen a lot, however, I try to give myself more time to intellectually digest and process what I am learning before immediately moving on to the next item in my queue.

While neither experiment was initially pleasant, the results proved interesting. Trying to dive deeper has resulted in an increase in cognitive capacity for grappling with new ideas. My commonplace is still a bit scattered and certainly not organized enough to please Erasmus, but I have already seen value in making connections between the books I read and my daily routine.
