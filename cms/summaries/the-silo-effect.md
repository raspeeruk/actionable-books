  ### The Paradox of Our Era


  > "…while the world is increasingly interlinked as a system, our lives remain
  fragmented… Many large organizations are divided, and then subdivided into
  numerous different departments, which often fail to talk to each other—let
  alone collaborate. People often live in separate mental and social ‘ghettos,’
  talking and coexisting only with people like us."- The Silo Effect, page 13


  Despite the broad phenomenon of globalization, and the actual interdependence
  of systems and institutions, our day to day lives are lived, very often, in
  tiny silos. The word silo comes from the Greek for “corn pit”—and is still
  used to describe the towers that store grain. The contemporary usage of the
  term began in the military—to describe the chambers that stored guided
  missiles. Eventually, it was adopted by the management world—and is used to
  describe structures such as departments or units of an organization as well as
  mindsets—often associated with tunnel vision and tribalism.


  Specialization and expertise are required in a complex world—and we are
  comfortable in our tribes. However, when siloed ways of thinking are all we
  have, then we don’t see the possibilities that arise from interconnections.
  The results can be catastrophic—the senior leaders of UBS genuinely did not
  know that they were losing billions of dollars because the activities that
  contributed to the meltdown were happening outside of their view and in a very
  narrow silo. Sony ceded its place at the top of the electronics industry when
  it produced multiple (mediocre) digital music recorders, using different
  technologies. A company founded on the premise of innovation had grown large
  and fragmented, leaving the opening for the iPod that soon followed—the
  product of a company that worked hard to create collaboration and avoid silos.


  Examples are plentiful—and combatting the destructive effects of silos
  requires a great deal of intention. When we are intentional and do transcend
  our silos, the possibilities for innovation and new ways of thinking emerge.

  ### Change the Way You Classify


  > "...the crucial point about Cleveland Clinic…was that it showed the value of
  thinking about classification systems. When people…were encouraged to
  reimagine the world—say, by looking at the world from the perspective of
  consumers, not producers—they could often become more innovative and
  effective."- The Silo Effect, page 217


  We are born classifiers. Through the act of classification we create meaning.
  In example after example, however, we see that our classification systems can
  limit our thinking and limit innovation. While every story in this book
  relates in some way to our propensity towards classification and the value in
  rethinking the categories we create, none is more powerful than the story of
  the Cleveland Clinic.


  Here, an entire hospital was reorganized around the patient’s view of the
  world, disrupting the status of surgeons vs. non-surgical doctors, nurses vs.
  doctors, etc., in an effort to provide care around the true needs of the
  patient. For example, a Urological and Kidney institute brought together all
  caregivers who work on that specific body system together—changing the
  perspective on the patient and the possibilities for patient care. The result
  was a more humane and people-centered institution—built on an already
  progressive foundation.


  Classification systems exist in institutions—and in our own minds. Where can
  we reframe and rethink the classifications that we take for granted?

  ### Step Out of Bounds


  > "…breaking down silos can spark innovation in unexpected ways. If people are
  willing to take risks by crossing boundaries in their own personal lives, this
  can deliver unexpected benefits."- The Silo Effect, page 143


  One of my favorite stories in Tett’s book is about Brett Goldstein, who left
  his role as operations manager at Open Table to join the Chicago police
  department. While a highly unlikely move (so much so that his fellow officers
  suspected him of being a Fed plant) he contemplated the possibilities of using
  his experience in the Internet start-up world to improve the system by which
  policing happens.


  After a grueling training and serving as a street cop, he found his way into
  designing a system by which potential murders were actually anticipated and
  prevented. It was only because he was able to connect the dots from what he
  knew about the streets and what he was able to do as a tech geek that this
  innovation was possible. While you’ll need to read the book to find out the
  challenges his innovation faced—the idea of seeing possibilities because of
  our own capacity to shift our boundaries and rethink how we see the world is
  inspiring and accessible to all of us.
f_conclusion: >-
  By now I’m sure you’ve realized just how much I enjoyed reading Gillian Tett’s
  book. Great stories, great lessons, great writing. And, while I’ve read more
  overtly actionable books, this one keeps coming to mind as I work with
  organizations and see possibilities for thinking differently about what we can
  do by shifting our understanding of boundaries and classifications.

  "Why do humans working in modern institutions collectively act in ways that
  sometimes seem stupid? Why do normally clever people fail to see risk and
  opportunities that are subsequently blindingly obvious? Why, as Daniel
  Kahneman, the psychologist put it, are we sometimes so 'blind to our own
  blindness?'"

Gillian Tett, the U.S. Managing Editor and a columnist at the Financial Times, began to explore these questions during the financial crisis of 2008. Her eventual conclusion was that the financial system was deeply fragmented— which contributed greatly to the meltdown. Post-crisis, Tett began to explore this “silo effect” outside of the finance industry as well—ultimately resulting in this book.

What makes _The Silo Effect_ especially interesting is that Tett holds a PhD in anthropology—her doctoral thesis explored marriage in a Muslim village in Tajkistan. Here, she applies an anthropological lens to the exploration of silos in organizational life. “Silos,” she writes, “are cultural phenomena, which arise out of the systems we use to classify the world.” Cultural anthropology serves as a powerful lens through which to shed light on how those systems operate.

Tett is a marvelous writer and storyteller—and this is a book of stories. We read about the destructive effects of silos—and the possibilities and power in silo-busting. We also understand why we create silos. Some of the stories are based on situations we are likely to be familiar with—especially around the financial meltdown—while others are more unexpected, such as the story of the Cleveland Clinic. In all cases, her perspective is refreshing.

Within each of these stories are warnings and lessons about what not to do—and possibilities of ways to live our lives to reduce the power of silos. While not a “how-to” book, one can find in its pages insights that can help us to think and act differently.
