  ### Where Are You Heading?


  > "As you walk your path, it is always, every moment of every day, curving
  either upward or downward."- The Slight Edge, page 142


  When Jeff, a beach bum at the time, had his moment, he also had a remarkable
  breakthrough. He realized that the secret between spending his life as a beach
  bum or a millionaire lay in the simple actions he made every day giving him
  the slight edge. When we are failing, he discovered, we will do whatever it
  takes to get ourselves moving upward again. However, once we are successful,
  there is a natural tendency in all of us to become complacent and start to
  fail. We go up and down on this wavy course never really allowing ourselves to
  push through to success. Why do we stop doing the things that made us
  successful in the first place? Jeff argues that all we need to do we already
  know – they are simple actions – we just need to keep doing them, not give up,
  and over time, we will succeed.

  ### The Seven Daily Disciplines For Success


  > "Consistently repeated daily actions + time = unconquerable results."- The
  Slight Edge, page 65


  Wow. Think about that for a moment. Let that one sink in because it is
  something you need to think about everyday to make the slight edge work for
  you. All those little decisions – the small, quiet choices we make when no one
  is looking – ultimately decide our life’s direction.


  They may seem insignificant (who is going to know if I hit snooze?), they may
  seem not to matter today (it’s just one day – who cares?). But they DO add up.
  They DO matter. If I had hit snooze once again, my path begins to curve
  downward. When I chose to get up and run, I made a positive choice toward my
  goal and my path begins to curve upward – and if I keep doing that
  consistently, I will see results. It is inevitable.


  Even with my distaste for math, I can see that equation works.


  Bottom line: Every day we are either moving towards the direction we desire or
  further away from it based on the decisions we make which determine where we
  end up. No one fails overnight – nor do you succeed overnight (Hollywood
  endings aside). The real life difference is in creating our own formula of
  daily disciplines in seven areas for success that we decide and then design
  for ourselves.


  Here’s the best news. You can start anytime you choose. You can (and should)
  start right now, knowing that compounding interest math example I gave you
  earlier and Jeff’s voice now in your head, too – “Easy to do – just as easy
  not to do.” (You’re welcome.)


  Here are the seven disciplines Jeff identifies as the areas we need to work on
  daily: your health, happiness, relationships, personal development, finances,
  career and our impact on the world.


  There is a helpful little worksheet in the last few pages of the book to write
  notes on your goals and how you plan to get there and putting a deadline to
  those goals. The real work starts after you make that goal list with dates.
  I’m already paying more attention to keeping my goals in front of me and
  making sure that every day I do something to move me a little closer to
  reaching them – to keep moving my curve upward. We don’t need to make huge
  quantum leaps – there are none. I was reminded of this Chinese proverb while
  reading how to start incorporating the slight edge everyday: “A journey of a
  thousand miles begins with the first step.” This book was my first step – and
  an excellent one – on my path to reaching my goals.


  Here is a little exercise for you that Jeff asked in the book – considering
  the seven disciplines (health, happiness, relationships, personal development,
  finances, career and your impact on the world) – do you feel you are moving up
  or down in each of those categories currently? How would you change your path
  to move upwards in the areas that need adjusting? Ready to get started? It’s
  easy to do.

  ### What is the Slight Edge? It’s Simple.

  simple daily disciplines. Simple productive actions, repeated consistently
  over time. That, in a nutshell, is the slight edge."- The Slight Edge, page 10


  Okay, really? Is that it? He believes it is – and has convinced me I can do
  this too. He has a very powerful, motivational expression he uses throughout
  the book: “Easy to do – but just as easy not to do.” Usually I find an author
  who keeps repeating a singular quote counterproductive – meaning, it becomes
  forgettable because I wish to ignore it. But in this case, Jeff’s repeating of
  this one powerful line worked. I will never forget it. It really stuck. So
  much so that now when I stretch to hit the snooze button on my morning alarm
  while ignoring my running shoes guiltily staring at me from the floor, I hear
  what I imagine Jeff’s voice to be in my head repeating “easy to do, just as
  easy not to do.” He is very persuasive. I have actually started getting up
  earlier than my husband {gasp!} and am running in the mornings. I know. I
  can’t believe it either. But it’s better than arguing with Jeff, because he is
  right, of course. It is easy not to do and go back to bed. But it was just as
  easy to get up (okay, full disclosure, perhaps not easy the first time.
  However, it did get easier).


  Jeff had already changed my life and I was only on Chapter 4. I couldn’t put
  this book down. Then I read this next little insight and was blown away.

> "No matter in what arena, in life or work or play, the difference between winning and losing, the gap that separates success and failure, is so slight, so subtle, that most never see it." _\- The Slight Edge, page 87_

This is the philosophy behind _The Slight Edge_ written by Jeff Olson, which begins with a very relatable and engaging personal story of how we all – at some point in our lives – find ourselves at life’s crossroads landing in a place where our previous choices and decisions delivered us. But is it the path you want to be on? He knew that in order to change, things had to change. He had to change. And that’s when he discovered the slight edge.
