  ### The Slight Edge


  > "Your philosophy creates your attitude, which creates your actions, which
  create your results, which create your life."- The Slight Edge, page 27


  The Slight Edge is the simple _productive_ actions, repeated _consistently_
  over time that ultimately leads to success. It is _that_ simple. But, Olsen
  goes on to explain that the simplest actions are also that simple to overlook
  or excuse away for “tomorrow”. Their apparent insignificance, their simplicity
  and the perceived ample opportunity for a “re-do” is what separates the
  successful from those that are… less successful.


  Olsen reminds readers “only 5 percent achieve the level of success and
  fulfillment they hoped for. The other 95 percent either fail or fall short.
  The only difference is _The Slight Edge_.”


  This simple, yet profound theory can be applied to every arena of your life.
  If optimal health is a priority, those simple small actions could be a
  commitment to 30 minutes of cardio a day or making a conscious choice to
  consume a healthy breakfast every morning. If finances were your focus,
  perhaps tracking expenses daily and preparing meals at home would account for
  your small daily actions.


  Olsen points out that those 95% of people are conducting seemingly harmless,
  yet _unproductive_ actions _consistently_ overtime that ultimately lead to
  failure. This could be ordering take-out lunch every day leading to poor
  health stats, or overlooking networking connections which are missed
  opportunities for your start up vision, or crediting time to a weekly sport
  rather than committing time to your important relationships. All of these
  actions are seemingly insignificant, but over time add up to insurmountable
  roadblocks and ultimate failure.


  _The Slight Edge_ serves as a prescribed plan that is personalized, adaptable
  and logical, although Olsen doesn’t promise a path without hurdles. Successful
  people fail their way to the top—it is not a clean report card you are looking
  for—progress comes with challenges, setbacks and obstacles but it is how you
  redirect and reroute that separate those that are successful. Olsen’s mantra
  is, “do the thing and you shall have the power.”

  ### Cultivate Habits


  > "The creation of habits it is a pure slight edge: simple little actions,
  repeated over time."- The Slight Habit, page 218


  There are two kinds of habits that Olsen references, habits that serve you and
  your personal growth and those that quite simply, don’t. Creating productive
  habits serve your _Slight Edge_ journey and provide something for you to
  “hang” your intentions on. Olsen provides readers with seven positive, _Slight
  Edge_ approved habits to incorporate starting NOW.


  1.  **Show Up**. Make like Nike and Just Do It. Establish your small,
  productive actions and envision your end goal.

  2.  **Be consistent**. The kicker is that those small, productive actions are
  DAILY choices, achievable and yet progressive.

  3.  **Have a positive outlook**. Olsen shares research that suggests the more
  positive your outlook, the more productive your output, increasing your
  likelihood of an upward curve toward success. He encourages a daily inventory
  of blessings, writing down or sharing small wins or areas of gratitude on a
  consistent basis.

  4.  **Be committed for the long haul.** _The Slight Edge_ does not provide a
  quick fix or overnight results, you must be aware of the invisible progress
  and set yourself up to handle the incremental shifts towards your end goal.
  Much like healthy weight loss, _The Slight Edge_ forms habits lending itself
  to long-term sustainability.

  5.  **Cultivate a burning desire backed by faith**. “The few people who
  achieve great things are those who not only passionately wanted to achieve
  them but also clearly see themselves achieving them”.

  6.  **Be willing to pay the price**. Olsen suggests that in order to make the
  change or to see the progress you have to give something up, to make room for
  these new, consistent actions. That could be giving up Tuesday’s beer league
  or Saturday’s sleep in.

  7.  **Practice Slight Edge Integrity**. What you do when no one is watching.


  In summary, Olsen suggests in the pursuit of success “…it means embracing
  living uncomfortably in order to attain a life that is genuinely
  comfortable—not deceptively comfortable.”

  ### Everything Curves


  > "What I didn’t yet know was that nothing ever stays the same. Everything is
  in motion, always. Everything changes"- The Slight Edge, page 6


  Olsen suggests that everyone is on a _life path_, and that path is not
  straight but rather a curve. A curve is in constant motion, either towards
  success or away from it. Every action we take is a movement in one direction
  or another. At first, it is a fight for survival, once we have our head above
  water he argues that 95% of us stop doing those integral things that led us to
  that success point, that often unconscious decision is what sets you back in
  the direction of failure. He argues that if we continue to make those small
  actions that got our head above water, we will land at the shores of success.


  That curving continuum or _life path_ correlates with positive and negative
  tendencies associated with success or failure. Those set for success often
  possess the habit of taking responsibility, owning up to missteps and errors
  where those set for failure often exhibit patterns of assigning blame.


  Likewise, those that are set for success often have their eye on the prize, a
  vision for their future, where those set for failure tend to have a foot
  firmly planted in the past.


  “The problem is that most of us live with one foot planted firmly in the past
  and the other tucked timidly in the future—never in the moment.” Olsen writes.
  “_The Slight Edge_ is all about living in the moment.”
f_conclusion: >-
  Whilst a lengthy and at times tedious venture, _The Slight Edge_ provides
  clear takeaways, and readers are truly set up to capture all the applications.
  For those who value efficiency in all forms, the valuable concepts will, at
  times, appear to drag on with anecdotes and stories, but rest assured the
  Insights awaiting are worth it. Bonus: There are summaries at the end of every
  chapter should you want to skim over the fluff.

> "The same activities that take us from failure to survival would also take us from survival to success—if we just keep doing them." _\- The Slight Edge, page 13_

_Slow and steady wins the race_, a cliché not widely accepted these days. In a world of quick fixes, immediate results and lofty resolutions, Jeff Olsen sets out to encourage readers seeking success and progress to opt for a lifestyle shift, one that adopts incremental actions, daily intentions and long term commitment.

While not earth shattering, _The Slight Edge_ is a supremely practical guide that uncovers very logical, deliberate actions that, when applied, can ultimately lead to success in all facets of life: health, wealth, personal development, relationships and overall happiness.

Equipped with two main parts, Olsen introduces the readers to the fundamentals. First, the theory of the Slight Edge by making connections and incorporating fables to really drive home the basics. Second, Olsen digs deeper into adoption, equipping readers with evaluation tools and a sort of workbook that encourages immediate application of the presented concepts. Throughout, Olsen keeps the inspiration alive by encouraging his readers to dig deep, practice humility and envision their ultimate successes.
