  ### System 1 and System 2


  > "…our addiction to the quick fix has physiological roots."- The Slow Fix,
  page 16


  Neuroscience provides some insight into why our brains seem to gravitate
  towards the easy, fast answer more often than not. We have two systems for
  solving problems: System 1 and System 2 (I’m desperately working to not invoke
  Dr. Seuss here, with Thing 1 and Thing 2, but I digress). System 1 is fast and
  intuitive, perfect for life or death situations. System 2 is slow and
  deliberate – conscious, critical, analytical and rational. System 1 was
  perfect when we were being chased by wild tigers every time we stepped outside
  our caves. System 2 is perfect for our knowledge-based world. The problem is
  that System 1 is more developed and waaaaaaay easier to use than System 2. And
  System 2’s logic and reason are so good that it can actually help us
  rationalize our System 1 temptations. Add to this our natural proclivities
  towards familiarity and optimism, and our inherent aversion to change, and
  it’s really hard for us to consciously decide against our first instinct in
  favour of a longer, more complicated and untried solution that might not work.
  The fact is, though, that **when we do invest time and effort and let System 2
  do its thing, great breakthroughs occur.** So the key is to be willing to
  **defy trends, banish naysayers and ignore pressure in order to solve
  problems** thoroughly and permanently.

  ### Intuition is a double-edged sword


  > "…practice, planning and preparation allow you to fix things quickly when
  the clock is ticking."- The Slow Fix, page 113


  Experts develop a strong sense of right and wrong, good and bad, working and
  malfunctioning in their particular area of expertise. Whether it is in Formula
  One racing, basketball, forensic criminal investigation or corporate mergers
  and acquisitions, the author offers legions of examples where individuals have
  made a gut call or split-second move that turned out to be the absolutely
  right thing to do at the time. In all cases, though, those experts were able
  to make those split-second decisions because they had invested years in
  training and experience such that their “intuition” was highly sensitized
  based on knowledge and skill.


  In many other cases, though, intuition was blown off course by emotions and
  biases – that pesky System 1 interfering in spite of all best efforts to
  thwart it. The conclusion in this case is to not only prepare (by training,
  testing and observing over time), but to have our intuitive judgments checked
  and sometimes refined by others. **Second, third and fourth opinions have
  great value when we are tackling hard problems**, which is why the chapter on
  intuition, “Prepare,” is best complemented by the subsequent chapter,
  “Crowdsource” where we learn that **the power of the individual is most
  valuable when supported by the wisdom of a group**. Or, as the Formula One
  expert says, “No matter how good you are, you’re always better with someone
  else. No one can do it all on their own.” The message here – **trust your gut,
  but check it with others if the stakes are high.**

  ### Schedule a daily Clinton moment and say, "I was wrong"


  > "...think of how much more efficient – not to mention agreeable – your
  workplace would be if every error could be a spur to working smarter."- The
  Slow Fix, page 43


  There are fourteen different behaviours in _The Slow Fix_ that illustrate ways
  we can change our approach in order to change our outcomes, and the first one
  is “Confess.” In example after example, the author finds evidence that **not
  only is it cathartic to admit mistakes, it’s actually the most reliable path
  to learning both for individuals and organizations** – and the consequences
  are rarely as bad as we fear.


  From a hipster wearing a Barry Manilow T-shirt across campus (to almost no
  notice whatsoever) to RAF airplane mechanics flagging inspection failures for
  even very minor issues, we learn that the learning that comes from
  identifying, analyzing and then solving a mistake has huge value. A high-end
  girls’ school in England even instituted a “Failure Week” to help students –
  and faculty, and parents – get comfortable with honest feedback and the value
  of being wrong. **The message is simple – own up rather than cover up.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Every chapter in _The Slow Fix_ offers Insights worthy of testing. The
  “devolve, feel, play, evolve” sequence of ideas speaks to the benefit of
  examining even things that are working to get out ahead of potential problems.
  Constant experimentation, willingness to abandon the familiar in favour of a
  crazy idea, and focusing on the process rather than the outcome – all secrets
  to finding sustainable, significant solutions to complex problems. Simple?
  Yes. Easy? Not at all.

> "…though my life has been transformed by deceleration, the virus of hurry still clearly lurks in my bloodstream." _\- The Slow Fix, page 3_

**Carl Honoré is in a hurry to tell us about how slow is better.** It’s always been his way; ever since a mad dash through Heathrow nearly resulted in him choosing to simplify his life by speeding up the bedtime stories he told to his child and subsequently resulted in him writing _In Praise of Slowness_. _The Slow Fix_ begins with another personal story of Carl coming to terms with his own adrenaline-fueled demons – he shares his story of having irregular, short-burst, infrequent acupuncture to solve chronic back pain, saying he’s been in a hurry to fix his back for twenty years and has wondered why the treatment hasn’t been working (although the reasons are perfectly clear to his acupuncturist).

As is his way, Carl uses his personal insight as an impetus to begin a journey exploring the phenomenon of our collective disposition towards fast answers, shortcuts and easy solutions. Whether he’s asking the question in hopes that he’s not alone or trying to solve a major social problem doesn’t matter – he travels far and wide, examines everything from education to the military to fine art to fad diets to organ donation and gives us fantastic examples of why slower really is better.
