  ### Context not cognition


  > "Successful influence is increasingly governed by context rather than
  cognition."- The small BIG, page xvii


  In the past, it was the person who had the most information that had the power
  but today, information is everywhere. The latest persuasion science research
  reveals that attempts to just ‘tell’ are highly likely to fail.


  What most people fail to realize is that it is not just providing information
  or ‘telling’ that leads to change. Rather, it is the context in which it is
  presented. A small change in the setting, framing, timing or context of how
  information is conveyed can dramatically affect the impact or change that
  results.


  Behavioral scientists who study the theory and practice of influence and
  persuasion show us how breathtakingly small the changes need to be to result
  in enormous effects. Furthermore, these small changes rarely require extra
  time, effort or money!


  This is good news for us. Anyone can significantly increase their impact on
  others by making small shifts in their approach so that they link their
  message to deeply felt human motivations.

  ### One ingredient and just five minutes


  > "…research from the behavioral science suggests that adding a single
  ingredient to the productivity recipe can improve the result and will do so at
  no cost."- The small BIG, page 50


  Leaders searching for the recipe for productivity have tried all sorts of
  incentive systems. But there has been one missing ingredient. Until now. And
  to top it off, this ingredient is free and takes under five minutes!


  What is it?


  Connect your people to the difference they/their products or services make to
  others.


  The authors reference Adam Grant’s research in which he tests his theory that
  if employees are connected to the purpose of their work, they will be more
  motivated and more productive. He believed (and proved it to be true) that
  workers fail to reach their potential when they lose track of significance and
  meaning in their jobs. You can read more about it
  [here](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/give-and-take/).


  I heard a presentation at a recent conference in which the pharma company
  leader shared a couple of excellent applications of this idea.


  1\. She asked her associates _“If you know someone who benefitted from our
  medication, tell us their story.”_ To encourage people to submit and read
  them, they held a contest online in which people could vote for the stories
  that most inspired them.


  2\. She challenged her people to answer the question “_Why do you work for
  this company?”_ They conducted a global story contest and created videos of
  the top 20 stories. The authors were also rewarded by presenting their stories
  to other countries.


  Bottom line, help your people learn, firsthand, about the difference they make
  to people’s lives. Change the mindset. Everything you think, say and do should
  be thinking about that difference you make.

  ### Quick fix for your next meeting


  > "Meetings are where minutes are taken and hours are wasted."- The small BIG,
  page 93


  To give you an example of the types of insights offered in _The small BIG_,
  let me take a real-life influence challenge and apply a few of those insights.


  **Challenge:**


  You are running a meeting and you have been tasked with:


  1.  increasing the attendance of the meeting and

  2.  improving the productivity


  As usual you are swamped and don’t have much time to spend on this.


  Here are the small changes you could make that have been proven to spark a big
  difference. Of course you don’t have to use all of them but, just like
  parties, the more the merrier!


  a) Increase attendance with the following ideas:


  #1 – first invite the people most likely to come, then share their positive
  response with others


  #2 – choose a deadline for RSVP that looms closer rather than further away


  #3 – point out what could be lost if the meeting is not held


  #4 – ask for a verbal commitment to attending


  #5 – to help them create a concrete plan to make sure they don’t miss the
  meeting, ask those people who are planning to attend what they will be doing
  immediately before the meeting


  b) Now that you have great attendance, you might as well think about improving
  the productivity of meeting. What little changes could you make?


  #1 – to increase the speaker’s influence, advise him/her to dress in a similar
  style as the audience but at a higher level


  #2 – to encourage co-operation, take time to focus attention on the things the
  members of the group share


  #3 – to uncover new opportunities when the attendees know each other well,
  invite someone who knows them less well


  #4 – to motivate the group, share stories up front about how the product or
  service they are working on has served others


  #5 – to encourage action, rather than asking people to commit to a change
  right away, ask them to agree to a change that would be implemented down the
  road


  #6 – to reduce wasted time, ask those attending to submit information before
  the meeting


  #7 – to encourage all to participate take a few minutes to ask everyone to
  quietly reflect and then write down their ideas and submit them. Be sure to
  have the person leading the meeting speak last


  #8 – to create collaboration, seat people in circular format; if your goal is
  to focus attention on individuals taking responsibilities then choose angular
  seating (like a square or rectangle)

  Influencing others is how we can make change in our world. Instead of banging
  your head against the wall, it makes sense to look to the research. _The small
  BIG_ offers 50 shortcuts that have been proven to get you to your destination
  faster with less effort. I’ve shared a few here. Why wouldn’t you check out
  the rest?

> "The purpose of this book is to demonstrate, with scientific evidence, how making small changes in your approach can lead to big differences in how successful an influencer and persuader you are." _\- The small BIG, page 164_

Do you know exactly what you should say and do to move someone forward? What if you could make small changes that spark big influence?

Written by influence heavyweights Steve J. Martin, Noah J. Goldstein and Robert B. Cialdini (known as the leading social scientist in the field of influence), _The small BIG_ offers us fifty insights supported by research to prove their validity. Each insight involves a small change you can make that leads to big results. And since we all influence others all day long, every day, these little gems are incredibly useful.
