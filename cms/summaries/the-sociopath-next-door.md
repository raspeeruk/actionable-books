  ### Conscience: The 'Seventh Sense', is something we feel


  > "I believe that all people of conscience should learn what the everyday
  behavior of these people looks like, so they can recognize and deal
  effectively with the morally weak and the ruthless."- The Sociopath Next Door,
  page 45


  Martha Stout, a consulting psychologist at the Harvard University Medical
  School has studied sociopaths for more than 25 years. She wrote the book to
  help those with a conscience better cope and deal with sociopaths they
  encounter.


  Stout’s inspiration for the book involved a conversation with Bernie, a fellow
  psychologist colleague. He was overwhelmed by the events of September 11, 2001
  and was unsure he could provide the emotional support a patient needed at the
  time. In a moment of despair, he said to Stout, “You know, sometimes I wonder,
  _Why have a conscience?_ It just puts you on the losing team.” Stout asked,
  “If you had a choice, I mean really, literally had a choice — which you don’t,
  of course—would you choose to have a conscience like you do, or would you
  prefer to be sociopathic, and capable of . . . well, anything at all?” Bernie
  reflected for a moment and said, “You’re right”. “I’d choose to have a
  conscience.” Stout asked for a reason. He confessed saying, “You know, Martha,
  I don’t know why. I just know I’d choose conscience.”


  **Like Bernie, the overwhelming majority chooses conscience.**

  ### Avoidance is your trump card


  > "The only truly effective method for dealing with a sociopath you have
  identified is to disallow him or her from your life altogether."- The
  Sociopath Next Door, page 336


  Psychologists rarely recommend avoidance as a solution. Here, Stout makes an
  exception. While sociopathy has no cure, sociopaths almost never want to be
  cured.


  The victims profiled in the book express tremendous relief when they can
  finally end contact and communication with a sociopath. While it is not always
  possible to end all communication, the author recommends minimizing contact.
  While family and friends may sympathize with a sociopath, it is important to
  remember that sociopaths do not have feelings to hurt. Avoidance is the best
  policy.


  **Example**: Stout cites many examples of different types of sociopaths, one
  of which is Luke, a soft spoken and charming sociopath. Sydney is an
  accomplished academic and consultant who meets, marries and later divorces
  him. Luke ignores her soon after they are married. He later ignores their son
  and uses him as a bargaining chip to gain access to the house and pool after
  the divorce. One day when Luke is at the pool, Sydney asks him to leave. Luke
  starts to cry in front of his son. His son also starts to cry and says to his
  mother, “Oh no. Poor Daddy. Do we have to make him leave?” Luke’s eyes turn
  ice cold after he realizes he got away with it again. Sydney recognizes Luke’s
  deception and that the manipulation will never stop, so she moves to a
  different state with her son, ending Luke’s surprise visits.

  ### How can I tell whom to trust or conversely, whom not to trust?


  > "Apart from knowing someone well for many years, there is no foolproof
  decision rule or litmus test for trustworthiness, and it is extremely
  important to acknowledge this fact, unnerving though it may be."- The
  Sociopath Next Door, page 222


  Stout says there is good news and bad news. The good news is that at least
  **ninety-six out of a hundred people are bound by the constraints of
  conscience** – they have a high standard of decency and responsibility. The
  bad news is there are individuals who have no conscience and cannot be
  trusted.


  Stout says sociopaths “are nearly always invisible to us”, because they
  willfully pursue positions of respect and authority. They use flattery to
  manipulate, telling us what we want to her. We like to think our education
  prevents us from being fooled. Yet, the most people are unable to identify a
  sociopath in their midst.


  Stout says, the single most valuable clue in identifying a sociopath is the
  pity play. The most universal behavior unscrupulous people display is not of
  fear but to appeal to our sympathy. Good people let certain individuals they
  view as pathetic get away with murder. Sociopaths, fully aware of this,
  repeatedly play on the pity card to great effect.


  Stout recalls an opportunity in graduate school, where she interviewed a
  court-referred ‘sociopath’. He was not violent and preferred swindling people
  out of their money through investment scams. Stout asked him what was most
  important in his life? She thought he would say, “making money” or “not
  getting caught and going to jail”. Instead he said, “Oh, that’s easy. What I
  like better than anything else is when people feel sorry for me. The thing I
  really want more than anything else out of life is people’s pity.”


  **What can you do?**


  Stout cites 13 rules for dealing with sociopaths in everyday life.


  Rule number 9 is to question those who appeal to your pity too easily. She
  says, more than fear, more than admiration, pity from good people is carte
  blanche. When we pity, we become momentarily defenseless and emotionally
  vulnerable. Those without a conscience are waiting to seize the opportunity.


  She says pity should be reserved for innocent people, experiencing genuine
  pain and misfortune. She says chances are likely 100 percent that you are
  dealing with a sociopath if they regularly appeal to your sympathy, while
  consistently hurting you or other people.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Sociopath Next Door_ is an important book because it offers a clear
  glimpse into the mind of a sociopath as well as effective coping tools. The
  author believes the best weapon against sociopaths is to lead a good life but
  do so with the blinders off. The author ends the book on a positive note
  believing that having a conscience blesses individuals because their lives
  have meaning every day. **Those without a conscience cannot feel, cannot love
  and do not care about anyone except themselves.** Their lives usually follow a
  downward spiral where they end up alone and without status, power, and
  authority – all the things they worked so hard to rob from others.

When I shared with friends I was reading _The Sociopath Next Door_ by Martha Stout, they thought it was a book about criminals, serial killers, child molesters, and crazy people. They did not think it was about those few people we work, live, and have fun with in our lives who have no conscience or regard for others.

_The Sociopath Next Door_ is a chilling and fascinating book because it talks about a subject most of us with a conscience have little or no knowledge and we believe it will never happen to us. Sadly, sociopathy is more prevalent than anorexic eating and schizophrenia disorders. **A whopping four percent of the population (or 1 in 25 people) is a sociopath with little or no conscience.** Mental health professionals refer to the condition as “antisocial personality disorder”, a non-correctable disfigurement of character that is incurable.

Sociopaths today are difficult to identify because they are chameleons and blend well into society. They are charming, well-mannered, well-dressed and strive to infiltrate positions of authority, influence, and respect through a myriad of lies and deception. They are skillful at appearing unduly kind and interested in people with a conscience.

They have a strong need for stimulation and take frequent social, physical, financial, and legal risks. Their goal is to manipulate the society’s social contract to their advantage that the rest of us follow. They are obsessed with more status, power, wealth, or ego for themselves.
