  ### Take Small Steps


  > "A kaizen approach asks you to take small steps toward your goal. These
  steps are so small that they may seem useless, but that’s why they work."- The
  Spirit of Kaizen, page 18


  How do you build a lifelong habit of exercise when everything you’ve tried has
  failed? Maybe your efforts are still too large. Have you tried exercising just
  one minute a day? A minute? Yep. No, that is not a typo. Maurer explains that
  kaizen is so “simple and painless that people tend to dismiss it.”


  The idea behind kaizen, meaning good change in Japanese, became popular during
  World War II, when the US industry needed to transition from manufacturing
  consumer goods to war materials. At its heart kaizen is the idea of continuous
  incremental improvement. Rather than dramatically changing their operations
  and disrupting production, factories instead focused on targeting hundreds of
  small things to improve.


  The author explains that there are two approaches for dealing with change:
  innovation and kaizen. Innovation demands sweeping broad adjustments,
  different paradigms, and different approaches. Kaizen, on the other end of the
  spectrum, focuses on tiny, almost imperceptible steps towards a change.


  Small improvements help bypass our biological responses to change. We are
  built to resist change, we like our routines. (I ate the same thing for lunch
  every weekday for over a year.) Our brains throw up red flags when we demand
  massive change in behavior. Occasionally, through sheer determination we can
  muscle our way past the brain’s alerts. However, that is often the exception
  rather than the rule as thousands of unused gym memberships illustrate.


  Kaizen’s small steps slip past our brains unnoticed. When these small steps
  are repeated consistently over time the change is made and the brains alert
  systems remain undisturbed.


  It sounds easy, so why isn’t kaizen more popular? Kaizen is the tortoise in a
  culture where hares receive the bulk of the attention and praise. What can you
  do to apply kaizen? It starts with your questions.

  ### Don’t Streetlight


  > "…we all tend to look for answers in the places where the looking is
  easiest."- The Spirit of Kaizen, page 159


  When seeking improvement we tend to favor the low hanging fruit. There is a
  story where a policeman sees a man searching the ground under a spotlight. The
  policeman asks the man what he is doing. The man indicates he is looking for
  his keys which he dropped some distance away but he is searching here because
  the lighting is better. Scientist David Freedman explains that we often tend
  to look for answers in the places where the looking is the easiest, not where
  we are likely to have the best results. If we work to focus on the efforts
  that can provide more improvement rather than by their level of ease, we will
  have more success.

  ### Ask Small Questions


  > "For reasons that nobody truly understands, the brain cannot reject small
  questions. Any small question, especially one you ask repeatedly, prompts your
  brain to begin its own Google search."- The Spirit of Kaizen, page 99


  When confronted with a problem, we demand our brains produce a miraculous
  solution, a brilliant stroke of inspiration provided instantly. Unfortunately,
  most often, we run into road blocks, stymied for any solutions.


  Instead, Maurer suggests we scale our questions down, focusing on the smallest
  improvement that we could immediately implement. He explains that “our brains
  are also designed to respond to fear by shutting down access to the mental
  resources we need to create change.” Demanding an immediate answer to reducing
  expenses by 25% is akin to asking the captain of a sinking ship to explain the
  second law of thermodynamics. Under stress our brains are strained; creative
  reserves are walled off, fight or flight mode kicks in, and creatively solving
  a problem is a concern that doesn’t register.


  Conversely, asking small questions daily provides the coals to stoke the fire
  of ideas, all while bypassing the brain’s fear of recognition. Don’t expect
  immediate answers, give your brain some time to work on the problem. Small
  questions naturally lead to small implantable ideas, which is the idea behind
  kaizen. If you want to increase your income, asking how I can double my income
  will create very different answers than what I can do today to earn an extra
  dollar. Figuring out how to earn such a small amount seems trivial, but helps
  to shift your thinking so that eventually you arrive at the desired result.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Spirit of Kaizen_ helped me see change in a different light. Maurer’s
  explanations of kaizen provided a smaller perspective to how I can change my
  behavior and solve problems that I wouldn’t have previously considered. For
  example, I am left handed and writing with many pens is a chore. Your left
  hand pushes the ball across the page rather than let it trail behind when used
  with the right hand. I tried a number of different pens to alleviate my
  frustrations. Nonetheless, a recent batch of more expensive pens have proven
  more frustrating than usual, resulting in more irritation than ink on the
  page. After a discussion of the book with my wife she picked up a pack of pens
  for a dollar. After a few days of use I haven’t had any problems with the
  pens. In fact, they write better than most of their more expensive
  counterparts. Now this was a simple small step, but it has produced a positive
  change. Kaizen and my wife helped me learn that simple solutions should not be
  disfavored based solely on their level of complexity.

  "When you need to make a change, there are two basic strategies you can use:

  doable steps toward improvement."

The idea of change is often met with mixed emotions ranging from mild discomfort to panicked anxiety. What if change didn’t have to be such an uphill battle? What if taking smaller, not larger, steps were more likely to produce success? Little steps are precisely what doctor and professor Robert Maurer, author of _The Spirit of Kaizen_, believes. He says that little steps are often preferable to disruptive changes because they are not only easier but also more effective.
