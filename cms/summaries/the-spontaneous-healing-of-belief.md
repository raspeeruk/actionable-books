  ### The Universe Works like a Huge Computer


  > "Each person is born with an infinite power, against which no earthly force
  is of the slightest significance."- Neville Goddard (philosopher, 1905-1972),
  quoted in Spontaneous Healing of Belief, page 131


  Just as every computer uses a language to create results, the universe’s
  consciousness computer uses our “beliefs” about belief to “speak” to the stuff
  that the world and our bodies are made of.


  Intriguingly, the author suggests the compact technology on your desk (or in
  your hand) actually holds the key to the world’s greatest mysteries. Despite
  tremendous evolution in size and speed, the idea of required commonalities
  such as hardware, an operating system, commands and programs to create output
  remain little changed.


  On that basis, we are guided through various “lessons” (called belief codes)
  to understand how to get our “computers” to perform differently. To attain
  that goal, we don’t alter the operating system. We change what goes into it.


  Three major ways of knowing – belief, faith and science – are tested. Belief
  translates into personal power. Through it, we hold the gift of a universal
  force – the ability to impact our lives, our bodies and our world by choice.

  ### Try Out the Miracle Patch


  > "The new way of seeing things will involve an imaginative leap that will
  astonish us."- John S. Bell (quantum physicist, 1928-1990), quoted in
  Spontaneous Healing of Belief, page 155


  Besides logic, miracles further provide a solid reason to see our world
  differently. A miracle is defined as “an event that appears inexplicable by
  the laws of nature.”


  Gregg asserts our job may be less about questioning the extraordinary things
  that happen daily and more about accepting the awe they deliver. To
  demonstrate, he encourages us to promise to locate at least one miracle upon
  leaving home today. Without any bounds, we’re to intend recognition when they
  inevitably cross our paths.


  Since experimenting for myself, I find them showing up everywhere!


  As Braden poses, what would it mean if you could suddenly awaken and realize
  your deepest passions or greatest aspirations? Seems to me, the implication is
  clear. From the healing of disease, to the length of our lives, to the success
  of our careers and relationships, everything we experience as “life” is
  directly linked to what we believe.

  ### Build Your Personal Logic Patch


  > "There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn’t true; the
  other is to refuse to believe what is true."- Soren Kierkegaard (philosopher,
  1813-1855), quoted in Spontaneous Healing of Belief, page 103


  Braden goes on to wonder why so many people cling to limiting beliefs. He
  theorizes the universe’s consciousness computer could have a glitch. Perhaps
  all we need is a “patch” to “fix” the problem.


  To rewrite our reality code, we must first give ourselves a reason to change
  past beliefs. The mind needs to see a flow of information leading us to a
  logical deduction. In some branches of mathematics, proofs in the form of “If
  this … then that” offer such conclusions.


  Building on this template, we’re taken through a series of statements (based
  on our facts and personal experience) that indisputably bring our dreams to
  life:


  1\. State in one sentence how you feel regarding your desired outcome as if it
  has already happened. (I feel \_\_\_)  

  2\. State which passion you are choosing to express. (I have a passion to
  \_\_\_)  

  3\. State the limiting beliefs you have about yourself and/or fulfilling your
  need. (My limiting belief is that \_\_\_)  

  4\. State the opposite of your limiting belief(s). (My non-limiting belief is
  \_\_\_)  

  5\. State when you feel most fulfilled in life. This will become your goal. (I
  feel most fulfilled in life when \_\_\_)  

  6\. State the inarguable fact(s) that support your goal. (It is a fact that
  \_\_\_)


  Like a formula, number 2 constitutes the “if” portion (i.e., if I have a
  passion to help others). You can have as many “and” statements against items 5
  and 6 as you wish. Point 4 draws the logical conclusion (i.e., then it makes
  sense that…my works makes a meaningful contribution…And I have all I need to
  bring my dream to life).

> "The universe may be nothing more than a giant hologram created by the mind." _\- David Bohm (physicist, 1917-1992), quoted in Spontaneous Healing of Belief, page 37_

In _The Spontaneous Healing of Belief: Shattering the Paradigm of False Limits_, Gregg Braden continues his pioneering work to bridge science and spirituality. His searches through high mountain villages, remote monasteries and forgotten texts permit us access to these timeless secrets from the comfort of home.

As scientists continue to explore what it means to be participants (not passive “victims”) of our world, new evidence points to an inescapable conclusion: We live in an interactive reality where we change the environment around us by changing what happens inside us.
