  ### The Evolution of You


  > "So which is it? Should you follow a plan or stay flexible? Should you
  listen to your heart or listen to the market? The answer is both."- The
  Start-up of You, page 51


  Starbucks and Flickr. They’re two of the biggest start-up successes in recent
  memory. But did you know that they were both very different companies when
  they started out? Initially Starbucks sold coffee beans and the equipment to
  brew it. Flickr wasn’t even called Flickr. It was called Gaming Neverending,
  where photo sharing was just one component. But it was that one component that
  took off. Recognizing that this feature filled a marketplace need, the
  entrepreneurs at the helm made photo sharing their singular focus, and Flickr
  is the result. Starbucks did the same, when they realized their quality beans
  and unique culture was their real market advantage.


  But for every Starbucks or Flickr who successfully (and almost seamlessly)
  evolved from Plan A to an unexpected Plan B, there are countless more examples
  of once successful companies who failed to evolve… and became extinct. One of
  the most obvious examples in recent years is Blockbuster. Blockbuster “just
  about laughed us out of their office” when a growing start-up met with them
  about teaming up in order to solve some of their distribution problems (page
  20). That start-up was Netflix and the year was 1999. 11 years later, in 2010,
  Netflix made a profit of 160 million dollars, while Blockbuster filed for
  bankruptcy because they “failed to adapt to the Internet era” (page 20).


  Just as start-ups have to be adaptive, so do individual careers. Reid and
  Casnocha offer Sheryl Sandberg as an example. Sandberg grew up not taking her
  Western privileges for granted and graduated from school with the expectation
  that she would find a job directly helping others. And for awhile she was,
  working at the World Bank and later working on American policy. But her career
  took her to Google and most recently to Facebook where she is now the social
  media giant’s COO. Sandberg isn’t helping others in such an obvious way, but
  when you look at the role social media (and Facebook in particular) has played
  in the Egyptian uprising, she’s still providing others with the tools to
  better their lives.


  The point is that no matter what you may think, the plan that you create for
  your career is bound to evolve… so long as you’re open to the journey, no
  matter where it may take you. The two following Insights will make it easier
  for you to shift your thinking now, in order adapt your career later. Because
  chances are you will have to.

  ### Learn Something New—On Your Own


  > "Unfortunately, for far too many, focused learning ends at college
  graduation. …. But as much as you can, prioritize plans that offer the best
  chance at learning about yourself and the world. Not only will you make more
  money in the long run, but your career journey will be more fulfilling."- The
  Start-up of You, page 60


  Education should not stop when you receive your university diploma, or be
  limited to on-the-job learning. Unless you’re very fortunate, gone are the
  days when companies would offer their employees extensive training in order to
  broaden their knowledge and foster their talent. The responsibility is
  squarely on _your_ shoulders to invest in _yourself_ and _your_ future.


  Not to mention the fact that we’re living in an age of rapidly changing
  technology. If you don’t keep up with it, you’re putting yourself in a very
  precarious situation where you could easily be eclipsed by the competition.


  The good news is that it’s easy to not only keep up, but also expand your
  knowledge (**transferable skills**) in order to more effortlessly change
  careers (should such a move be in your future).


  _“Writing skills, general management experience, technical and computer
  skills, people smarts, and international experience or language skills are
  examples of high option value—that is, they are transferable to a wide range
  of possible Plan B’s. Once you’ve figured out which transferable skills to
  invest in, make a concrete action plan you can stick to, whether by signing up
  for a course or conference, or simply by pledging to spend one hour each week
  self-learning_” (page 78).


  For me, I’ve pledged to learn PhotoShop. Do I think I’ll ever be at the level
  to create a print ad? Probably not, but investing in this skill is something
  that will benefit me down the road, and will also provide me with a creative
  outlet.

  ### Retain Your Identity


  > "…have a professional identity that you can carry with you as you shift
  jobs. You own yourself. It’s the start-up of you."- The Start-up of You, page
  64


  We’re all our own commodities, and the faster we realize that, the better.
  Screen legend Elizabeth Taylor learned it when she was thirteen. When she
  wasn’t fired after telling off Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM, for speaking
  distrustfully to her mother _(“You and your studio can both go to hell!”_),
  Taylor realized that she had some intrinsic value to Mayer; that it was the
  stars who packed the audiences into the darkened theatres. After all, had she
  been a janitor and spoken to Mayer that way she likely would have been let go
  on the spot. Taylor was irreplaceable, and would harness this power later
  while negotiating the first million dollar salary for a single film
  (_Cleopatra_, 1963) and creating the most successful celebrity fragrance of
  all time (White Diamonds). Preserving your sense of self, and knowing what
  you’re worth as a commodity, is important.


  For many of us this awareness is difficult however, and we find it challenging
  to look past the job we have now. Casnocha and Reid offer a satire from the
  _Onion_ as an example: “\[After Obama became the president elect in November
  2008\] medical personnel had to be dispatched to help Obama campaign workers
  found lying on park benches and wandering city streets aimlessly, their lives
  devoid of meaning after election victory” (page 64). A satirical exaggeration?
  Certainly! But I think we can all see the truth in it.


  Coincidentally, just this week I was Skyping with a friend and asked him what
  he could see himself doing if he didn’t hold the job he has now. He listed a
  number of possibilities, which showed to me that he knew his worth as a
  commodity in the work force.


  The authors of _The Start-up of You_make some great suggestions on how to
  retain your own identity (brand!) while working for someone else. Establish a
  blog and build up a portfolio of work that is separate from your paid job. Go
  a step further and commission some stylish business cards in your name, with
  your personal e-mail address and phone number on it, and maybe even include
  the address of that new blog on it!

  It’s no secret that the workforce has changed drastically, and at Actionable
  Books it’s one of our missions to remind our audience of this. Sure, the
  escalator may be crowded, but with _The Start-up of You_, Reid Hoffman and Ben
  Casnocha have provided us all with tools to ensure you land a prime spot near
  the top.

Reid Hoffman (co-founder and chairman of LinkedIn) and Ben Casnocha share a little secret in their book, _The Start-up of You_: The workforce escalator is crowded.

Not so long ago that wasn’t the case. After graduation, you made your way onto the escalator from the bottom step, and slowly rode your way to the top, attaining new career heights the longer you were on for the ride. But with the death of the traditional career path, the escalator’s overcrowded and many are left feeling exasperated and directionless.

But it’s far from hopeless for those who look at themselves as a start-up. “The business strategies employed by highly successful _start-ups_ and the career strategies employed by highly successful _individuals_ are strikingly similar,” write the authors (page 20).

All human beings are entrepreneurs. Get investing in yourself.
