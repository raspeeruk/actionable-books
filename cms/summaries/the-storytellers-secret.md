  ### Brain control


  > "Drugs produce an especially powerful surge of dopamine – one so intense
  that a single hit can hook a person for life. Scientists are finding that the
  very same reward centres in the brain are also involved in persuasion,
  motivation and memory. These findings have profound implications for your
  success."- The Storyteller’s Secret, page 5


  I’ll admit it. I never realised the significance neuroscience can play in
  proving which stories work and why, until I read this book. The concept seems
  counter-intuitive to what we’ve previously been taught about storytelling.
  That is, don’t kill your audience with facts and data – connect, using
  emotion. But the fact is, science has proven the brain chemicals _cortisol_
  and _oxytocin_ make people pay attention and evoke feelings of empathy towards
  speakers.


  Neuroscience also boosts the argument for why authenticity and being genuine
  are an essential part of successfully capturing the hearts and minds of an
  audience. For storytellers, science confirms people really can tell the
  difference between a real smile and a fake one; proof (if we needed it) that
  using a personable and friendly style really does makes an impact.


  Our attention spans have declined. According to Lloyds TBS research referred
  to by Gallo, the average adult attention span has dropped from 12 minutes in
  1998 to a mere 5 minutes in 2008. Why? Social media exploded in 2008 and now,
  simultaneously, Twitter, Instagram, Vine, Snapchat to name just a few,
  distract and challenge our ability to stay focused.


  Nevertheless, storytellers in the book like Adam Levine and Richard Branson,
  who suffer from ADHD and dyslexia respectively, show us that we have capacity
  to turn constant distraction and inability to stay focused into dedicated
  concentration. By keeping things simple, and using language that activates the
  brain through vivid mental images while presenting a story, we can give our
  audience perspective to an idea or situation they previously had little
  personal experience of.


  Steve Jobs is cited repeatedly in _The Storyteller’s Secret_ as someone who
  captured attention extraordinarily well. Yes, we are becoming a little
  fatigued by the business world’s addiction and constant references to Jobs’
  and Apple’s success, and why we must all aspire to emulate similar
  storytelling techniques, but Gallo’s justification for referencing Jobs (a
  lot) is summed up beautifully in this simple statement: “Jobs delivered wow
  moments in every product launch”. After a quick re-watch of the 2007 iPhone
  presentation, you’ll be inclined to agree.

  ### The strength of simplicity


  > "Say what you mean and mean what you say and preferably in as few
  well-chosen words as possible."- The Storyteller’s Secret, page 114


  TED Talks are limited to 18 minutes. Why? “Because great storytelling doesn’t
  have to be complicated” says Gallo. Richard Branson, Ernest Hemingway, Steve
  Jobs and Winston Churchill are highly regarded for their skill in keeping
  things simple. Using uncomplicated language, their ideas are easy to
  understand and their level of influence is high.


  Research in the book suggests that our short term or ‘working memory’ only
  helps us remember three to seven items at once. For instance: “Ready, set, go”
  and “Lights, camera action”.


  To simplify storytelling, start with one idea before bringing in more.
  Practicing the ‘_rule of three’_ can help you achieve, well, three things:


  1.  A simple template to build your story

  2.  A way to share ideas in a way your audience will remember

  3.  Inspire action!


  Some other final tips from Gallo on delivering a simple story:


  *   Use pictures to help audiences remember and understand content

  *   Avoid awkward language by using two syllable words where possible

  *   Be brief and articulate

  *   Practice your story until you can create interest in 60 seconds or less

  ### Find your hero


  > "Once listeners are figuratively walking in the shoes of the protagonist –
  the hero – they feel as though they have a stake in the outcome and are
  willing to do whatever is necessary to help the hero reach his or her final
  destination."- The Storyteller’s Secret, page 219


  Bryan Stevenson, who received the longest standing ovation in TED’s 30-year
  history says “Narrative is hugely important in effective communication”. This
  sentiment is supported by Oprah, John Lasseter and other ‘characters’ featured
  in _The Storytellers Secret_, having learned the impact their personal stories
  can have on audiences worldwide. While individually unique, the link between
  these leaders and legends’ stories is the relatable hero at the heart of them;
  themselves. They bring the audience into their personal struggle by sharing
  how they overcame adversity to discover something about themselves or their
  business along the way.


  Now, think about your personal journey; where you are today. Consider that
  defining moment when you faced a challenge that actually taught you a valuable
  lesson, although you didn’t see it at the time. Whether it’s a sad moment, a
  funny or totally outrageous event, this is the element of your story that can
  capture attention, connect and educate. You are the hero.


  The ‘Dramatic Arc’, a Hollywood film industry concept, or the ‘Classic
  Storytelling’ structure adopted by the likes of J.K Rowling outlined in _The
  Storytellers Secret,_ can help build a story by organising your content into
  three clear parts.


  **_The Dramatic Arc_**


  1.  _The backstory_: Sets the scene, the hero, the place, the challenge

  2.  _The emotional hook_: The hero’s once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, their
  elusive break

  3.  _The resolution_: Reaching the goal, how the hero makes the impossible
  possible


  **_Classic storytelling_**


  1.  _Trigger event:_ An initial fact, event or action in the hero’s life

  2.  _Transformation:_ The hero is affected by a change of some kind

  3.  _Life Lesson:_ The hero learns a lesson to live a better life


  Finding your hero and weaving your personal experience into a story using a
  dramatic arc or classic structure will help you build a strong narrative that
  will impact your listeners. Remember, storytelling is about emotionally
  connecting with your audience.
f_conclusion: >-
  This book is dedicated to 50 featured visionaries and risk-takers who have
  mastered the art of storytelling and who inspire us to live better lives.
  Beyond the individual stories, _The Storyteller’s Secret_ really teaches us
  that simply put, a good story can help explain an idea, but a great story
  educates, entertains, inspires, and ultimately fires up our collective
  imagination.
