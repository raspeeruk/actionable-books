  ### Success is the result of action and mindset


  > "\[Successful people\] stay focused on their past successes rather than
  their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get
  them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all of the other
  distractions that life presents to them. They are constantly proactive in the
  pursuit of their chosen objectives."- The Success Principles, page 204


  When reflecting back on _The Success Principles_, the key takeaway that comes
  through clearly in the text is that success is the result of action and
  mindset. Canfield suggests that the reader do activities such as write out
  their vision and mission for their life, write down meaningful goals and
  create vision boards. The point of doing all of this is to imagine and believe
  in what’s possible. After all, if you were bogged down in negative feelings
  and thoughts, it would feel impossible to achieve what you desired. That’s why
  Canfield emphasizes creating a positive, success-driven mindset that will
  support you daily.


  Sometimes no negative, fear-based thoughts may seem a bit unreasonable. At
  some point, one will creep into our mind. Canfield suggests an exercise for
  managing this that I found very useful. He suggests writing down the negative
  thought on a piece of paper. Then right below it write a “turnaround
  statement.” This is a statement that affirms you or helps give you permission
  to release that thought.


  Once the mindset has been created, it’s then important to take action. It’s
  very easy to fall into patterns of planning and imagining, but at some point
  we do have to take action if we are to realize our goals. Canfield suggests
  spending the last 45 minutes of the day planning out the next day and
  reflecting on how the current day went. He calls this “The Evening Review.”
  Another suggested exercise is “The Daily Success Focus Journal,” where you can
  document your top 5 successes of the day and the reason why you consider them
  to be a success. Again, this is a way to celebrate what has been accomplished
  and then to use that as a tool to motivate you and assist in planning your
  next steps.

  ### Create Community


  > "You would never expect an athlete to reach the Olympic Games without a
  world-class coach."- The Success Principles, page 304


  Sometimes blazing the trail to success can be a lonely, solitary path.
  Canfield reminds us that we don’t have to be alone on the journey. There are
  numerous ways to create community around our success and in the end, we are
  better for it. There are times when we need someone to help us stretch to our
  limits or give us a pep talk along the way, which is exactly why creating a
  community to support your success is so valuable.


  Canfield lists several ways that you can go about doing this, including:
  hiring a personal coach, joining or starting a mastermind group, finding a
  mentor, hiring staff and making space for personal introspection. Each of
  these offers something slightly different in terms of support and it is
  important to find the one (or combination) that works best for you. Over the
  last couple of years, I’ve found that hiring a personal coach, bringing on two
  part-time staff and making time in my schedule for yoga and walking has
  yielded the best results for me.

  ### Focus Days and Buffer Days


  > "Most entrepreneurs spend less than 30% of their time focusing on their core
  genius and unique abilities. In fact, by the time they’ve launched a business,
  it often seems entrepreneurs are doing everything but the one thing they went
  into business to do. Don’t let this be your fate."- The Success Principles,
  page 280


  I think the above statement is probably true for everyone – regardless of
  whether or not you are an entrepreneur. Canfield suggests that excellent time
  management is essential to success. If we want to be great at something or
  achieve a particular goal, we need time in order to do it. In light of that,
  he suggests creating Focus Days and Buffer Days in your schedule. A Focus Day
  is a day where you spend at least 80% of your time in your core genius and a
  Buffer Day is when you prepare and plan for a Focus Day. There are also Free
  Days, which are full 24 hour periods that involve no work, emails or phone
  calls.


  Focus Days are fairly straightforward and I think this is what everyone
  strives to have more of in their schedules. But what’s interesting is that we
  don’t often engineer our schedules to actually create these days by chunking
  tasks and delegation into other days. That’s where Buffer Days come into play.
  Canfield suggests spending your Buffer Days “learning a new skill, training
  your support team, or delegating tasks and projects to others”. This was the
  biggest “ah ha moment” for me while reading this book and is a tip that I’ve
  implemented. Right now I strive to have three Focus Days and two Buffer Days
  in my week.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Success Principles_ is a timeless self-help book that I know I’ll be
  referring to again and again. There are hundreds of pages of very actionable
  advice, which can make it overwhelming to digest, but also yield many ways to
  arrive at your own success.

There are numerous self-help books out there, but few are as timeless and powerful as Jack Canfield’s _The Success Principles_. Canfield himself is an amazing success story and lives a life that is inspiring. He is co-creator of the _Chicken Soup for the Soul_ series as well as a trainer and keynote speaker. After years of training, speaking, and studying, Canfield distilled what he considers to be the 64 success principles.

The success principles are organized into 6 categories: The Fundamentals of Success, Transform Yourself for Success, Build Your Success Team, Create Successful Relationships, Success and Money, and Success Starts Now. There are some recurring themes throughout the categories and the principles. Taking full ownership, being present and focusing on a vision are key to implementing them. In addition to explaining the success principles, Canfield provides numerous inspiring stories and quotes for readers to see the principles in action.
