  ### You are the only thing standing in your way


  > "The right mindset can take you anywhere and everywhere."- The Suitcase
  Entrepreneur, page 37


  Sisson lists the four things you need to create the business and lifestyle you
  want – a laptop, an internet connection, a sound business idea and the right
  mindset. But that last point is the key to a real breakthrough. From my own
  experience of transitioning to entrepreneurship this year, I can attest that
  mindset is everything and it is very easy to become the road block that keeps
  you from achieving what you want. **“You really don’t need much at all – just
  your health, a smile and a sense of adventure”.**


  In our society there are many varying opinions about what success looks like
  and what material things should make up our lives. A house, a car, a nice
  office, etc. But that’s just what society and our culture tells us. That’s not
  necessarily what we need to feel successful and have a great life. **Thus
  achieving the right mindset is a process of shedding this traditional value
  system and opening your mind to new ways of defining your life.**

  ### It doesn't have to be totally unconventional


  > "It’s all very well having a business that gives you all the freedom in the
  world to do what you want. But the flipside of this is knowing what to do with
  it, and how to manage it all."- The Suitcase Entrepreneur, page 196


  This was the thing that surprised me most about this book – just because you
  might be traveling and have an online business, you’ll still face day-to-day
  challenges that might not look or feel any different than if your life was
  “normal.” Sisson spends a chapter discussing how she stays focused and well on
  the road – something I was definitely curious about – and the answers were not
  totally unexpected. For instance, the type of lifestyle that Sisson has and
  describes is one with endless choices. Yet, the antidote to this is to have a
  schedule or daily routine that helps you ensure that you complete your “most
  important actions” and create distraction free time in your schedule.


  Here are a few additional tips that Sisson offers.


  *   **Create balance and routine.** No matter where you are or what you are
  doing in life, balance is a constant struggle. Sisson suggests that the more
  discipline you develop, the more freedom you will have.

  *   **Set boundaries.** It is important to find time to disconnect from work
  and make time to really experience what’s around you – regardless of whether
  you are traveling or not.

  *   **Keep up appearances.** Timezones, hectic travel schedules and other
  circumstances can make it difficult to maintain good relations with your
  clients and friends. Be transparent and communicate clearly with everyone.

  ### Set yourself apart


  > "You don’t have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to reinvent yourself
  and your skills to ensure you stay one step ahead of the rest of the world."-
  The Suitcase Entrepreneur, page 80


  A large portion of this book is spent discussing how to build and set up a
  mobile business that you can run from your laptop. In conceptually thinking
  about your business, Sisson imparts a great piece of advice regarding how to
  position yourself to stand out from the crowd and she lists two key ways to
  achieve this.


  **1\. Simplifying information overload.** We live in an era of information
  consumption, which can become daunting. Position your business to prune the
  amount of information people need in an effort to simplify their lives.


  **2\. Supplying quality over quantity.** The Internet has revolutionized the
  availability of information and vastly lowered the cost of accessing it. In
  business, the advantage lies in your ability to package that information in a
  way that is appealing to your customer and clearly enhances their life.


  The basic concept behind both of these ideas is to make yourself really useful
  to your community and audience, which is something that not a lot of
  businesses are good at.

  When I finished reading _The Suitcase Entrepreneur_, I felt a renewed sense of
  excitement about what is possible in my life. In particular because Sisson
  provides wonderful tales of inspiration and practical tools to make it a
  reality. **The world really is our oyster.**

  "You have the right to live your life how you want to, without sitting in
  endless meetings, getting stuck in long commutes and having to be in one
  location in order to run a successful business and ultimately enjoy your
  life."

> "You have the right to live your life how you want to, without sitting in endless meetings, getting stuck in long commutes and having to be in one location in order to run a successful business and ultimately enjoy your life." _\- The Suitcase Entrepreneur, page 219_

**Have you ever found yourself dreaming about a life of travel?** Where you could go anywhere and do anything? Maybe you’ve been bit by the travel bug. But then you start to hone in on your life as it is now – maybe a 9-to-5 job, a family, other commitments – and it seems like a far stretch.

Natalie Sisson, author of _The Suitcase Entrepreneur_, unpacks this myth in her book to give readers a clear guide to achieving freedom and adventure in life and business. Natalie’s personal journey to a wanderlust life–and successful business owner to boot–serves as wonderful inspiration and is coupled with extremely practical advice for building your own ideal lifestyle and business.
