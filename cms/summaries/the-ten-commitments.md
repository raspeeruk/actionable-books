  ### Commitment is Intention


  > "For our lives to change, we have to change."- The Ten Commitments, page 9


  According to Dr. Simon, commitment is a one-pointed intention toward the
  fulfillment of our deepest desires. Intentions that carry such power never
  return to their un-manifested state. The fulfilment of a commitment is
  realized when our intentions become our automatic style of functioning in the
  world. The actions we take move us through a door of change through which we
  don’t plan to return.


  To make solid choices that reflect the type of person we really want to be, we
  are offered Commitments (along with reflections and practices) within 10
  realms:


  1.  Freedom

  2.  Authenticity

  3.  Acceptance

  4.  Relaxation

  5.  Wholeness

  6.  Forgiveness

  7.  Love

  8.  Abundance

  9.  Truth

  10.  Peace

  ### Commit to Acceptance


  > "I encourage you to look for and nurture the seeds of rebirth in the ashes
  of loss."- The Ten Commitments, page 61


  Acceptance for the author means focusing on the present while assessing the
  choices available to you now. If there are many possibilities, make the choice
  likely to bring about the best results. If there is only one choice, take it.
  If there are no obvious choices, relax and accept that for the moment, you
  cannot do anything.


  To reinforce this point, an example is made of Lauren, a senior investment
  manager in a large organization who was abruptly downsized. After several
  months of anger, anxiety and depression, she finds a new role with a smaller
  company where she experiences greater control of her life and more satisfying
  relationships with clients plus staff.


  To enhance the essence of this Commitment, we are further encouraged to:


  *   **Take time at the end of every day to let go of any hurt, frustration,
  hostility, resentment or regret.** Spend five minutes breathing and quieting
  your mind. Tune into your stomach, heart and throat to release lingering
  sensations. This avoids carrying unnecessary pain from today into tomorrow.

  *   **Not beat up on ourselves over choices that seemed right at the time, but
  appear ill-conceived in retrospect.** Apparent errors in judgment often
  provide the most valuable lessons, expanding our capacity for humility and
  compassion.

  *   **Remind ourselves on a regular basis that everyone is doing their best
  from their level of awareness.** For instance, an independent four-year old
  child spilling milk while pouring a drink would (hopefully) not incur our
  wrath.

  ### Commit to Freedom


  > "In the defense our image, we imprison our spirit."- The Ten Commitments,
  page 19


  As David says, most people live in voluntary confinement, believing the
  security gained outweighs the freedom surrendered. Many mistakenly believe
  external forces limit their happiness. Ironically, our favorite fairy tales
  and epic sagas are the stories of heroic characters overcoming obstacles to
  freedom. These internal adversaries are embodied as the troll hiding under the
  bridge, the wicked witch and the wolf in the woods.


  Interestingly, opportunities to be liberated from our conditioned responses
  present themselves daily. Here is a step-by-step process to create such
  freedom:


  *   **Identify a violation**. The most recent time you were upset might
  involve a colleague chiding you for being late to a meeting. (You go on the
  offensive and rationalize all the company responsibilities that made you
  late.)

  *   **Get clear on the details.** Close your eyes and evoke the sounds and
  images that provoked you. (In response to their critical tone, your self-talk
  says: _“Who does she think she is? I don’t need her telling me how to do my
  job!”_)

  *   **Acknowledge the sensations.** Describe the emotions that arise while
  observing your inner dialogue. (You’re offended and exasperated.)

  *   **Recognize the trespass.** See if you can recognize the upsetting
  encounter as a violation of your self-image. (Your insecurity and
  self-importance are aroused.)

  *   **Reclaim your sanity.** Envision how you could have responded in a way
  that would be less reactive and more empowering. (You could use the
  unsolicited information to create more breathing room between your tasks.)

  As Deepak Chopra writes in the foreword, our planet stands at a crossroads. We
  can either continue to relate to each other with a tribal mentality or we can
  pierce the mask of “me against you” to embrace our underlying unity. What Dr.
  Simon does in this volume is to offer a practical path to speed our evolution
  individually and collectively for the benefit of our children, grandchildren
  and generations to follow.

> "When all your desires are distilled you will cast just two votes: To love more and to be happy." _\- Hafiz, quoted in The Ten Commitments, page 1_

In the spirit of both Eastern and Western traditions, in _The Ten Commitments: Translating Good Intentions into Great Choices_, Dr. David Simon shows how changing our mindset from self-imposed edicts to personal commitment can help us make the life transformations we seek. By committing to loving more openly, embracing abundance, relaxing and being authentic, we translate our desires into actions that bring about peacefulness, vitality and purpose.
