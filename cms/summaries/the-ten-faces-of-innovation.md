  ### Giving a Face to the Name


  > "Innovation \[is\]...‘People creating value through the implementation of
  new ideas’."- The Ten Faces of Innovation, page 6


  1.  _The_ **_Anthropologist_** approaches any challenge with a people-first
  mindset. Their innovation and insights are gained from observing and becoming
  a part of those who they’re attempting to serve. They approach challenges with
  a beginners mind and feverishly record their observations for later
  reflection.

  2.  When it comes to idea generation, **_The Experimenter_** embodies the
  spirit of ‘seeing what sticks’. They innovate by rapidly testing and editing
  ideas. Even though the early stages of their concepts often fail, they remain
  optimistic and view failure as a chance to try again. For The Experimenter,
  process trumps the end result.

  3.  **_The Cross-Pollinator_** is the Bumble Bee of the project, taking ideas
  from seemingly unrelated sectors and transposing them—or pollinating them—into
  the project at hand. How Apple used the hospitality industry as inspiration
  when designing their stores is a perfect example of the Cross-Pollinator at
  work.

  4.  **_The Hurdler_** is no stranger to hardships. This person understands the
  systems they work in and doesn’t take no for an answer. Their aura of
  stubbornness, coupled with grit and patience, allows them to turn walls into
  doors.

  5.  **_The Collaborator_** is a natural team player with a knack for coaxing
  people out of their comfort zones. This person sees the best in people and
  unites them under one mission. They’re your teams greatest defense against the
  skeptics by utilizing their extra-personal skills to get them on board before
  contradiction can arise.

  6.  **_The Director_** is the project lead (either officially or
  unofficially). While The Collaborator leads from within, The Director takes
  charge.This individual is often tasked with moving the project forward, even
  when faced with roadblocks and tight timelines. They are chemists—getting the
  right people in the room and creating magic between them.

  7.  **_The Experience Architect_** shines in the realm of user-experience.
  Think of a website that’s difficult to navigate; it leaves the user frustrated
  and unlikely to return. The Experience Architect works to correct this,
  designing compelling experiences that “go beyond mere functionality to connect
  at a deeper level with the person’s latent or expressed needs”.

  8.  **_The Set Designer_** sees the world as a stage and their team as the
  actors who perform on it. These individuals believe we are products of our
  environment and work to optimize spaces for greater productivity. Although
  their efforts benefit mainly their team members, their innovative minds will
  be tapped into by teammates looking to redesign spaces.

  9.  **_The Caregiver_** is a customer service guru, focusing their efforts on
  understanding the needs of those who they serve through action and empathy.
  Where they differ from roles like The Anthropologist is that they focus on
  individuals, looking to understand their needs to make them feel honored and
  valued.

  10.  **_The Storyteller_** is someone who knows that one of the biggest
  challenges isn’t getting your idea to its final stages, it’s convincing those
  outside the project why your idea is worth considering. Stories will help show
  not only how beneficial your project is, but just how genuine your companies
  values and mission is.

  ### Flex Your Innovation Muscles


  > "This book is…about the unsung heroes who work on the front lines of
  entrepreneurship in action, the countless people and teams who make innovation
  happen day in and day out."- The Ten Faces of Innovation, page 6


  Like anyone who has ever decided to start exercising, you understand that it
  takes time to see _any_ results. Similarly, groundbreaking ideas don’t come
  with the first brainstorm. Developing the habit of innovation takes time and
  reaping the benefits of it takes even longer. Similarly, introducing these
  concepts to your company will be a time consuming and laborious process. Adopt
  the mindset of _The Hurdler_ on this one and continue to practice patience and
  persistence. The rest, Kelly assures, will follow.


  For readers who have influence at their organization, support the folks at
  your company who create ideas that push boundaries. While you don’t have to
  agree with everything that is pitched, build on it to help keep it alive and
  moving forward. Your collaboration and support will be even more contagious
  than that of the Devil’s Advocate.


  For readers who may be at an entry level position within their organization
  and feel unsure of how these new ideas will be received, spend time each day
  ruminating on those “out of the ordinary” ideas. You don’t have to share every
  single one of them. But when you do, there’s a far greater chance that your
  bosses will appreciate the innovation and foresight.

  ### There’s No “I” in Innovation


  > "…the real payoff comes when you gather several roles together and blend
  them into a multidisciplinary team. Innovation is ultimately a team sport. Get
  all the roles performing at the top of their game and you’ll generate a
  positive force for innovation."- The Ten Faces of Innovation, page 262


  For innovation to become sustainable, habitual, and most importantly,
  beneficial to your organization, it must become part of everyone’s job
  description. Through his detailed case-studies, Kelly demonstrates that the
  greatest breakthroughs didn’t happen in silos. Quite the contrary. Ideas of a
  groundbreaking nature require a team of individuals who each bring a unique
  skillset to the table.


  For the greatest impact, Kelly recommends that individuals working on a
  project should be from diverse backgrounds (think: upbringing, class,
  education, sex, personality, etc.). The greater the diversity, the more likely
  these individuals are going to relate to and empathize with the individuals
  they are serving.


  Diversity isn’t enough, though. To make the most of a project, we must seek
  out those whose skills align with the project at hand. Be intentional with
  those who we ask to contribute. Diversity is good, but too many innovators can
  leave people frustrated, feeling useless and far less likely to contribute on
  future projects.


  Building on this idea, Kelly argues that a team is crucial to success because
  no one person can embody all of these personas at once. Some individuals may
  wear two or three hats simultaneously, but thinking you or someone on your
  team can wear all of them is unrealistic.

  If you’re looking to shake up your approach to projects, break out of a
  creative slump at work, or get a glimpse at the workings of one of the most
  progressive design firms on the planet, than this book is for you. The clean,
  simplistic layout akin to a high school text book might not appeal to all
  readers, but the content will hook you.

  "Successful businesses build fresh innovation strategies into the fabric of
  their operations. They do it year-round and in widely differing parts of their
  enterprises. When the team’s creative engine is running at top speed, the
  momentum and synergy can keep a company ahead through bad times and good."

> "Successful businesses build fresh innovation strategies into the fabric of their operations. They do it year-round and in widely differing parts of their enterprises. When the team’s creative engine is running at top speed, the momentum and synergy can keep a company ahead through bad times and good." _\- The Ten Faces of Innovation, page 12_

The practice of innovating is too valuable a skill to overlook. Businesses who downplay the importance of pushing _the_ boundaries and asking _the_ questions run the risk of becoming stagnant, inflexible, and irrelevant. What Kelly argues in _The Ten Faces of Innovation_ is that “innovation” is more than a buzzword found on the covers of business magazines; it’s a lifestyle and your company’s best secret weapon. If we choose to try and remain ahead of the curve in business, championing it is in our best interest.

Before divulging the ingredients to the secret sauce of innovation, Kelly let’s us know that it’s not an easy task to bring this fresh concept into your professional world. There are people who are actively working against it, specifically The Devil’s Advocate. Through their toxic negative approach and outlook on ideas, Devil’s Advocates are “the biggest innovation killer in \[the world\] today”. These naysayers nip ideas in their formative stages for a multitude of reasons all lacking serious conviction: “too costly”, “no one will buy it”, “it’ll never catch”, to name a few. All of these are subtle attacks to be on guard against. After all, if given the proper chance, these ideas could have world-changing potential.

We know who the enemy of innovation is. But what can we do to breathe the passion of creativity and innovation into our organizations? Enter The Ten Faces of Innovation_._
