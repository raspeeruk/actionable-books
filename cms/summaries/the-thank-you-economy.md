  ### Transaction or Relationship?


  > "People want to have close relationships with their brands. It still sounds
  a little weird today, but one day it won't. The right time to start building
  those relationships is right now."- The Thank You Economy, page 64


  How do your customers view you? Did they buy from you because you were the
  cheapest? Or because of something more?


  Gone are the days of captive audiences and solo retailers. People have choice
  now; an unprecedented level of choice. So much choice, as Sheena Iyengar
  pointed out in our recent [interview](../videos/all-about-choice/) with her,
  that it can, at times, be overwhelming. And so, consumers are looking for
  **relationships**. They want to build identity through their brand, and the
  products/services that they use. Your customers are more than a number in your
  balance sheet and they want to be treated as such. Making them feel special
  requires work.


  But here’s the good news. When your customers feel appreciated – when they
  consider their relationship with you to be more than a simple transaction –
  they get **loyal**. Fast. They’ll stick with you through thick and thin, and
  be willing to forgive your occasional slip up. As long as you’re
  **authentic**, **transparent**, and willing to admit when you’re wrong (and
  then make up for it), those individual transactions can turn into long term
  customer relationships, with the recipients not only buying more from you (and
  more often), but acting as your ambassadors as well. There’s very real ROI
  (return on investment) in that for you, and is not to be taken lightly.


  So, build relationships.

  ### Both ends of the spectrum


  > "Joie de Vivre has figured out that it's the big and the little stuff that
  matter most to building a brand's identity. The stuff in the middle is
  important for a company's survival, of course, but it's the one-on-one
  initiatives that lie at either extreme - the nit-picky details and the big,
  grand gestures - that make an impact, and make people talk."- The Thank You
  Economy, page 175


  In a great case study on [Chip Conley’s](../summaries/peak/) Joie de Vivre
  Hotel chain, Vaynerchuk touches on a crucial point: it’s the ends of the
  customer service spectrum that really makes companies stand out. It’s the
  attention to detail and the big, bold moves. Yes, you need shorter wait times
  on hold. Of course, your staff should be clean, courteous, and efficient. But
  great companies understand that this “stuff in the middle” is essential just
  to _survive_, not to thrive. Great companies go beyond – they personalize the
  experience for their customers by giving them exactly what **they** want (and
  not what market research shows they want). Little touches and big gestures.
  Fortune favours the bold.


  I love Vaynerchuk’s books. The passion virtually leaps off the page, tempered
  by a great awareness of the digital landscape. _The Thank You Economy_ is a
  great wakeup call and reminder to all of us – while we may play and work in a
  digital world, we live in a physical one, full of wonderful people who are
  just waiting for companies, products, and services that they can claim as
  their very own. Give them an opportunity to support you and connect with you,
  and you’ll be constantly surprised by the goodness of people.

  ### Rawness


  > "If you're going to launch a campaign, it has to be one that evokes an
  emotion - positive or negative - so that people feel compelled to share. Give
  them something to talk about, unleash the power of word of mouth, and allow
  them to pull you into their consciousness."- The Thank You Economy, page 133


  Step one of building customer relationships is remembering that these are
  **people** we’re talking about. Human beings. Creatures with emotions,
  opinions, and a desire to be a part of something larger than themselves. It
  doesn’t matter if you’re selling toothpaste, cars, or insurance, when you
  decide to make a stand on something – to really take a side – you’re going to
  get people talking. You certainly don’t want to be causing waves for the sake
  of it, but there is real value in telling the world what you stand for. People
  listen to passion, and it’s better to be polarizing than it is to attempt to
  make everyone happy.


  The next time you’re sharing your message, be it through a marketing campaign,
  a public announcement, or a thank you email you send your customers, don’t be
  afraid to be bold. Authentic. Genuine. With a real desire to support your
  loyal customers. But bold.

If you haven’t met Gary Vaynerchuk yet, do yourself a favour and seek him out. It won’t be too hard to do. As author of _New York Times_ bestseller [_Crush It!_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/)[_,_](../summaries/crush-it/) owner and host of winelibrarytv and future owner of the NY Jets (his words), Gary’s everywhere. He has close to 1 million followers on Twitter, is showcased regularly on MSNBC, highly sought after for speaking circuits around the world, and has made appearances on _Conan_, _Ellen_ and Jim Kramer’s _Mad Money_. Gary’s a dynamic personality, a larger than life visionary of the online world and one of the most crass public speakers who’ll ever share the stage with the likes of Seth Godin. (Check out last year’s [interview](../videos/from-the-horses-mouth-vol-2-crushing-it/) with him if you don’t believe me.) He’s also brilliant. (His brilliance is better displayed in [**this** year’s interview](http://actionablebooks.com/videos/gary-vaynerchuk-less-talking-more-doing/))

For all his bravado and strong talk, Gary has an extraordinarily keen sense of what’s happening (and is going to happen) in our digital world. In his sophomore book, _The Thank You Economy_, Gary dives deep into what he knows, and makes it accessible for the rest of us.

More relaxed and perhaps more polished than [_Crush It_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/), but with no less passion, _The Thank You Economy_ hammers home the very clear message that today’s consumer is looking for more than a product or service and, if we want to stay successful now and in the future, we had damn well better give it to them.
