  ### Six Behaviors of Innovative Leaders


  > "Bear in mind that \[these leadership behaviors\] are not merely for
  occasional use under unusual circumstances. On the contrary, each one is part
  of the checklist of daily leadership responsibilities."- The Three-Box
  Solution, page 213


  **Behavior 1: Avoiding the Traps of the Past**  

  Zig Ziglar was good at avoiding traps of the past by documenting everything.
  First, he started with a goal. Then, he broke down the goal into specific,
  measurable parts. The projects that are leading innovation normally start out
  big and putting them into a manageable size with a timeframe will help avoid
  past mistakes as they will be hard to overlook.  
    
  **Behavior 2: Being Alert to Weak Signals**  

  Here Vijay says that mavericks do not stop at the problem statement, they
  actually start by first understanding the problem and then “conceptualize
  unconventional solutions and a market opportunity that the solution can
  exploit.”  
    
  These individuals are the backbone of Box 3 who “work hard on the fringes of
  the organization. They are looking ahead and are not interested in the current
  customers or competitors.”  

  **  

  Behavior 3: Building the Future Every Day**  

  The current organization is already well established, but once the business
  seems to be running smoothly without hiccups, there needs to be a “sharing of
  knowledge” across all organizational groups. This is because “leadership is
  about balance. We as leaders have to learn to operate in all three boxes at
  once.”  
    
  **Behavior 4: Experimenting and Learning**  

  This experimentation stage will start with nothing which might be liberating
  at first, but as leaders learn you must reduce the risks in Box 3 projects and
  develop a dedicated team to help execute by constant critical feedback through
  evaluation, coaching, and appreciation for all parties involved.  
    
  **Behavior 5: Practicing Planned Opportunism**  

  This is a challenge because we have been taught to look at the problem rather
  than past the problem. It is going to take practice to ask more questions and
  build an awareness of good things that are happening in the process along the
  way. As the previous behavior was about experimenting, learning, and applying,
  remember to stay positive and opportunistic that the project you are working
  on as a leader will pay off.  
    
  **Behavior 6: Investing in the “Horse You Can Control”**  

  This behavior is based on the metaphor from Elizabeth Gilbert’s _Eat, Pray,
  Love_. “We gallop through our lives like circus performers balancing on two
  speeding side-by-side horses – one foot is on the horse called ‘fate,’ the
  other is on the horse called ‘free will.’ And the question you have to ask
  every day is – which horse is which? Which horse do I need to stop worrying
  about because it’s not under my control, and which do I need to steer with
  concentrated effort?”

  ### Assessing your organization’s leaders and yourself


  > "One of the keys to three-box balance is the availability of leaders who can
  manage the three boxes well."- The Three-Box Solution, page 215


  Vijay gives tools to act as a self-assessment for your organization by asking
  questions and then rating your organization. Once you have done the
  self-assessment it hopefully will help establish priorities for urgent matters
  that need to be addressed in their divisions of the organization.


  “_Evaluate a leader on the following dimensions using a 5-point scale, where 1
  = totally disagree and 5 = totally agree. A total score of 27 or higher
  indicates an ambidextrous leader:_


  1.  “_Create the future while managing the present_

  2.  _“Operate comfortably in two time horizons – 1-3 years and 5-10 years_

  3.  _“Evaluate performance in a proven business model and emerging industry_

  4.  _“Ability to experiment, learn and adapt with driving short-term financial
  performance_

  5.  _“Commit to embracing and leading change_

  6.  _“Leave behind behaviors, mind-sets, and attitudes that nonlinear changes
  make obsolete_

  7.  _“Understands importance of placing smaller bets first, before placing
  bigger bets_

  8.  _“Detect inflection points and nonlinear shifts (weak signals) in the
  industry environment and know the appropriate time to experiment with new
  business models_

  9.  _“Knows how to manage risk but not avoid it.”_


  Remember, each box is different in building, tearing down or restructuring.
  Another challenge for the organization is to “escape the traps of the past by
  identifying and divesting businesses and abandoning practices, ideas, and
  attitudes that have lost relevance in a changing environment.”

  ### Where Does Your Organization’s Culture Need Balance?


  > "Reflect on the mind-sets and behaviors needed for Box 3 to succeed
  alongside a prosperous Box 1 business. Then take a clear-eyed look at your
  current company culture."- The Three-Box Solution, page 215


  Vijay gives a plethora of questions that will challenge your organization to
  think deeper about where it is going. As there is growth, there must be decay
  to keep the balance. You might have questions already that will help you
  self-evaluate your personal and professional life, but Vijay asks the reader a
  lot of questions to help get at the core of innovation.


  To keep a balance between the boxes and the departments, ask “what is going
  well? What’s not? What’s had its day? What can be created or left behind going
  forward? How can you transform your team by assembling a dedicated team
  empowered to pursue a ‘clean-slate’ Box 2 approach? How will you mitigate
  cultural barriers or resistance instigated by the key stakeholders that
  dedicated team must rely on? What new cultural behaviors might you want to
  introduce across the organization to create harmony between Box 1 and Box 3
  activities?”  
    
  There will be a natural pull to keep something that you worked hard on but is
  not moving the organization forward or generating profit. The business world
  calls this “sunk cost.” You must ignore all sunk costs and push the
  organization into a better path.
f_conclusion: >-
  Box 1 shouldn’t be undervalued or overlooked even though you might want to. As
  a linear movement to “manage the present core business at peak efficiency and
  profitability.” This is the “comfort zone” and current “performance engine”
  for the organization, and these “linear innovations improve the performance of
  your current business model. By building on the present core by making use of
  the knowledge, systems, and structures already in place in the organization.
  It is the straightforward, unambiguous, and unthreatening to the status
  quo.”  
    
  This Box is essential to move toward new advancements and the “Board of
  Directors must embody the urgency and enthusiasm that the leadership has in
  order to be resilient in the company’s current market.” Box 1 will help feed
  the growth of Box 3, but you must leave things behind in the process through
  Box 2. This is a systematic process, but will serve the organization well as
  “A Strategy for Learning Innovation.”

> "The real problem for leaders is simultaneously meeting the performance requirements of the current business – one that is still thriving – while dramatically reinventing it." _\- The Three-Box Solution, page 1_

Vijay Govindarajan has implemented and obtained great feedback from companies like PepsiCo, Caterpillar, General Electric Company, Amgen, and Medtronic who use tools from _The Three-Box Solution_, a book written to “provide insight and guidance that will help the leadership and organization attend to the long-term future while addressing current priorities.”  
  
Vijay starts with Box 3, which encloses the organization’s ideas and strategies to “generate breakthrough ideas and convert them into new products and businesses” in a nonlinear movement – “creating new business models by dramatically redefining the set of customers, reinventing the value the company offers the customers, and/or redesigning the end-to-end value-chain architecture by which the organization can deliver that value.”  
  
Box 3 leadership must have “a sense of urgency” and generate positive self-talk by constantly saying “there has to be a better way.” This mindset is proposed and driven by a special group called Mavericks who are persuadable but thrive on “great execution, valuable feedback, and their leadership agenda is to continually evaluate the relevance of even core ideas and identities.”  
  
Vijay then looks at Box 2, which is a clash of nonlinear (Box 3) and linear (Box 1) mindsets and teams. When evaluating the organization, this box must be looked at to remove unproductive resources. Think about it as if Box 1 is the productive machine and in order for the organization to move forward, there need to be changes to this linear system with nonlinear Box 3 parts.
