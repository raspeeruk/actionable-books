  ### Which Wolf are You Feeding?


  > "The choice to thrive or to settle is a decision we make every day."- The
  Thriver’s Edge, page 34


  This quote reminded me of the aboriginal story known as The Two Wolves. One
  evening, an elder tribesmen told his young grandson about two wolves who
  reside within people’s hearts. One wolf is evil. It manifests itself through
  anger, envy, jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,
  resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.


  The other wolf is good. It exudes joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility,
  kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.
  Every day the two wolves battle one another in a bid to dominate our hearts
  and minds. The grandson is fascinated by this and after a moment asks his
  grandfather, “Which wolf wins?” to which the older man replies, “The one that
  you feed.”


  This is a simple and powerful lesson that often gets buried beneath the
  avalanche of tasks and demands that assail us daily. Thriving is a **choice**.
  Being kind, compassionate and loving is a choice. These behaviours are
  actually **decisions** that **we make**, decisions we exert control over. The
  ability to thrive, then, already lies within each of us; we need only to
  choose to thrive and then align our daily actions to make it so.


  What choices are you making today? Which wolf are you feeding – the survivor
  or the thriver?

  ### Anchors Aweigh!


  > "Moving into our greatness requires letting go of the need to try and
  control. It asks us to courageously cultivate the trust that when one door
  closes another will open."- The Thriver’s Edge, page 14


  Trust. Faith. Optimism. Belief. Hope. Conviction. Confidence. No matter which
  word you use, they all involve ‘letting go’ or ‘relinquishing’ control over an
  outcome. When sailors weigh anchor, they free the ship to leave the shore
  behind and trust that they will eventually see land again. It doesn’t mean
  they do nothing and drift aimlessly with the tide or that they expect picture
  perfect weather and smooth sailing. On the contrary, they deploy all the
  skills and technology at their disposal to guide the ship to its destination
  through whatever conditions they encounter. People who thrive in life, do the
  same.


  Stoneham observes that _living into our greatness isn’t an event…it’s not a
  straight line; it’s a spiral_ (I love that imagery!)_._ There are times when
  we feel we are going in circles and accomplishing nothing. Each of us has
  encountered set-backs in our careers and in our lives which make us question
  what we are doing and if we should stay the course or alter our direction. It
  can be hard to let go of our doubt and trust – in the process, in ourselves,
  in others. And yet, unless we do so, we are like ships moored in the harbor –
  full of potential but going nowhere.


  Take a moment to reflect on where in your life you are ‘settling’ instead of
  thriving. What beliefs, behaviours, relationships or situations do you need to
  let go of to enable yourself to weigh anchor and sail towards new horizons?

  ### Focus on the Horizon Not the Shoreline


  > "We must be willing to do the work required to draft the next chapter we are
  being called to create in our lives, while not allowing past conditions to
  dictate our beliefs about the future."- The Thriver’s Edge, page 132


  Stoneham believes people who thrive operate from a place of trust: they live
  in the present and have faith that things will eventually work out; they
  remain open to the possibilities and opportunities that arise in the moment.
  Survivors operate from a place of fear: they cling to the past and focus
  predominantly on the obstacles and limitations before them; they desperately
  want to control every aspect of their future. Like the story of the two
  wolves, it all boils down to choice. If you tend to see obstacles instead of
  opportunities, you will need to work at changing your perspective first and
  then work to ensure your actions help you capitalize on the opportunities and
  overcome the challenges so that you move towards the horizon and away from the
  shoreline.


  To help you do that, Stoneham developed her THRIVER framework – seven key
  practices that nurture a thriving mindset:


  **T**rust – have faith you are never traveling alone.  

  **H**umility – navigate with confident humility.  

  **R**esilience – choose the right bus.  

  **I**nner Direction – follow your compass, it won’t fail you.  

  **V**ision – walk into your vision, one step at a time.  

  **E**xpansiveness – broaden your horizons.  

  **R**esponsibility – be accountable for your choices.


  Whether you consider yourself a thriver or a survivor, chances are you can
  improve how you execute at least one and perhaps all seven of these practices.
  Which one will you pay attention to and develop in the coming month? Which one
  do you find the most difficult to implement and how can you be more deliberate
  in practicing it?
f_conclusion: >-
  The insights Stoneham shares in _The Thriver’s Edge_ have the power to nudge
  us out of complacency for the status quo so we can embrace a more meaningful
  and fulfilling way of living. Her messages reminded me that thriving is not an
  elusive final destination, it’s a journey. A mindset forged daily through
  deliberate choices and actions.

> "What helps people move from surviving to thriving? How can I learn to thrive and not hold myself back from being all that I’m capable of becoming?" _\- The Thriver’s Edge, page 2_

Author Donna Stoneham opens _The Thriver’s Edge_ with a sobering statistic: only 56% of Americans and 24% of adults surveyed throughout the world consider themselves to be thriving. Everyone else reported they are struggling or suffering. That’s a lot of unhappiness and under-utilized potential out there! Stoneham felt she needed to address this imbalance. So, drawing on her experience as an executive coach and educator, she developed a roadmap of sorts to help readers move beyond survival mode into a state of thriving.

Stoneham defines thriving as _our capacity to unleash our power to grow, flourish and experience a sense of trust and well-being in ourselves, our work, and our lives so that we may offer our greatest talents and capabilities to the world while helping others do the same._ For me, thriving is a verb – an ‘in-the-moment’ expression of positive energy generated by doing the things I love with a joyful heart. Like physical fitness, one cannot reap the benefits of thriving without a daily commitment to executing the practices that will sustain that energy and mindset.

Take a moment to reflect on where in your life you are ‘settling’ instead of thriving. What beliefs, behaviours, relationships or situations do you need to let go of to enable yourself to weigh anchor and sail towards new horizons?

Her messages reminded me that thriving is not an elusive final destination, it’s a journey. A mindset forged daily through deliberate choices and actions.

And speaking of deliberate choices and actions, each chapter in the book ends with several reflection questions and suggested practices to help readers integrate and apply the THRIVER concepts to their own life. While I read the book cover to cover, Stoneham actually recommends readers digest one chapter over several weeks to _allow what you learn about yourself to seep into your soul like a warm spring rain._ It is good advice and I intend to circle back and do just that.

Are you thriving or merely surviving? What small step or choice could you make today that would move you away from the safety of the shoreline and towards the horizon of possibility?
