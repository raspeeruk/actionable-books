  ### The Tipping Point of an Epidemic


  > "The name given to that one dramatic moment in an epidemic when everything
  can change all at once is the Tipping Point."- The Tipping Point, page 9


  In order to understand the emergence of television shows, products and fashion
  trends, or “the transformation of unknown books into bestsellers”, Malcolm
  suggests that we “think of them as epidemics”.


  Epidemic is [defined](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/epidemic) as _“a
  rapid spread or increase in the occurrence of something: an epidemic of
  riots.”_


  Not only are epidemics a result of some form of contagiousness, where little
  changes can have big effects, but also, and more importantly, epidemics don’t
  start gradually – they occur _dramatically_.


  And it’s that third aspect of an epidemic – the dramatic change; the point at
  which an epidemic actually _becomes an_ _epidemic_ – that’s called _The
  Tipping Point_. Every emerging television show, product, fashion trend and
  book, has a Tipping Point.


  _“The Tipping Point is the moment of critical mass, the threshold, the boiling
  point.”_


  But what determines when, and _how fast_, the idea, product or message,
  _tips_?  

  What determines the “tipableness” (my term, not Malcolm’s) of an epidemic?


  The following Insights outline the three fundamental areas that determine
  when, and how, an epidemic _tips_.


  _“Epidemics are a function of the people who transmit the infectious agents,
  the infectious agents itself and the environment in which the infectious agent
  is operating.”_

  ### The Stickiness Factor and the Power of Context


  > ""In epidemics, the messenger matters: messengers are what make something
  spread. But the content of the message matters too.""- The Tipping Point, page
  92


  No matter how connected, well-informed, or persuasive the people who spread
  your idea or message are, it won’t get very far if it isn’t _actually worth
  spreading_.


  _“Is the message – or the food, or the movie, or the product – memorable? Is
  it so memorable, in fact, that it can create change, that it can spur someone
  to action?”_


  In other words, will it _stick_?  

  How _sticky_ is your idea or message?


  Malcolm calls this **“The Stickiness Factor”**.  

  And the structure and format of your message, determines its _stickiness_.


  _“If you paid careful attention to the structure and format of your material,
  you could dramatically enhance stickiness.”_


  So how do you improve the _stickiness_ of your message?  

  How do you know which structure and format will actually _work_?


  Well, you conduct market research. You test the different structures and
  formats of your message with your target market to see which ones _stick_.


  For example, _Sesame Street_ hired psychologist Ed Palmer to head up their
  research team, and they tested the structure and format of each episode with
  their target audience: children. Throughout their research, they kept track of
  exactly when, and where, children paid attention, plotted their findings on a
  graph, and then analyzed the results. Sometimes the findings had them _going
  back_ to the drawing board.


  Now, you don’t need to go out and hire a psychologist, a big research team,
  and run every single test under the sun before actually _shipping_. The key
  point here is to _pay attention_ to how people are responding to your idea and
  message, and _learn_ from it.


  In what circumstances is it _sticky_? What _peaks_ their interest? What
  doesn’t?


  This is pretty much like a “beta” release. But what’s important, is that even
  _after you_ _ship_, you continue to track how _sticky_ your message is.
  Otherwise it won’t _stick_ for very long.


  And a key variable to pay attention to is the context of the message. Malcolm
  calls this **“The Power of Context”**.


  _“Epidemics are sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of the times and
  places in which they occur.”_


  Pay attention to the environment, conditions and circumstances of _not only
  the timing_, _but also the location_ of our messages. Sometimes it’s as
  obvious as understanding that we live in an age where social media technology
  is an extremely power tool for communication.


  Other times, like in the case of New York’s crime rate, it’s understanding
  that something physical like graffiti is a powerful feature, and signal, of a
  crime environment. And taking steps to clean it up is a powerful action and
  message against it.


  I wish I could go into each and every example Malcolm outlines in _The Tipping
  Point_. The use cases he shows are well worth reading the book front to back;
  whether it’s _Sesame Street_, Airwalk, teenage smoking or New York’s crime
  rate.  

  But then this would turn into a digital copy of _The Tipping Point_, instead
  of an actionable summary.


  So, I’ll close by re-emphasizing that whatever it is that you are trying to
  _tip_ – an idea, product or message – pay close attention to _the people_ who
  spread your message, _the structure and format_ of your message, and _the
  context_ in which you are spreading your message.


  Because a change in any of those, can lead to your very own Tipping Point.


  _“In the end, Tipping Points are a reaffirmation of the potential for change
  and the power of intelligent action.”_

  ### The Law of the Few: Finding Connectors, Mavens & Salesman


  > "…the success of any kind of social epidemic is heavily dependent on the
  involvement of the people with a particular and rare set of social gifts."-
  The Tipping Point, page 33


  People play a critical role in tipping an epidemic.  

  But it’s just not _anyone_. These are people with a “particular and rare set
  of social gifts.”


  Malcolm calls them Connectors, Mavens and Salesmen. It’s **“The Law of The
  Few”**.  

  And a single person can be one, two, or even all three of these “types of
  people”.


  **Connectors** have “a special gift for bringing the world together.” They are
  the kind of people “who know everyone.”


  Perhaps the most important trait of a Connector is that they genuinely enjoy
  connecting with, and keeping in touch, with people. And that’s why they blur
  the line between acquaintances and friends. They don’t mind taking the time to
  connect with someone, even if that person isn’t their best friend.


  As a result, they have a wide circle of friends, across different “worlds and
  subcultures.” And it’s this aspect that lends itself to the “tipableness” of a
  Tipping Point. A Connector can introduce an idea, product or message, to a
  wide audience.


  _“Word-of-mouth epidemics are the work of Connectors.”_


  **Mavens** are people who “connect us with new information.” While Connectors
  are “people specialists”, Mavens are “information specialists.”


  Similar to how Connectors genuinely care about connecting with people, Mavens
  genuinely care, and take pride in, sharing detailed information about ideas,
  products and messages with you. And that’s what sets them apart. They
  genuinely _want to_ inform, and help, you. And that’s what gets someone’s
  attention.


  _Pop Quiz: Guess how Connectors hear about the ideas, products and messages?_


  _That’s right, from Mavens!_


  _“A Maven is a person who has information on a lot of different products or
  prices or places. This person likes to initiate discussions with consumers and
  respond to requests. They like to be helpers in the marketplace.”_


  **Salesmen** are, well, Salesmen. While Mavens may know a lot of information,
  they aren’t there to persuade you one way or another. They’re just there to
  educate and help. Persuading is left to the Salesmen.


  They have a certain charm and likability to them – a certain level of energy
  and enthusiasm – that you can’t help but get excited and intrigued by their
  message. And that’s what sets Salesmen apart.


  _“Mavens are data banks. They provide the message. Connectors are social glue:
  they spread it. But there is also a select group of people – Salesmen – with
  the skills to persuade us when we are unconvinced of what we are hearing, and
  they are as critical to the tipping of word-of-mouth epidemics as the other
  two groups.”_

How did an _unknown_ author end up becoming a _bestselling_ author?  
What made _Sesame Street_ one of the most _popular_, and _effective_, kids educational TV shows in history?  
And how did Airwalk become _the number three_ footwear brand, behind Nike and Adidas?

And I guess, more importantly, why should you _even_ _care_ to know the answers to these questions?

Well, as Malcolm Gladwell so intelligently explains in his book, each situation above has one main, and central, piece: _The Tipping Point_.

The Tipping Point is _the difference_ between lighting a spark, and starting an inferno.

It’s the difference between Rebecca Wells having 7 people attend her book readings for one book, and 700 people attend for another.

It’s the difference between simply occupying kids with television, and actually revolutionizing kids’ educational television with Big Bird and the rest of the _Sesame Street_ family.

It’s _the difference_ between Airwalk’s $16 million in sales in 1993, $44 million in sales 1994, and $150 million in sales in 1995.

So it’s worth to not only be aware of _The Tipping Point_, but to also understand it.  
After all, I’m sure we all have ideas, products and messages, we want to _Tip_, as well.

And yes, there’s more to it than sharing a link on Facebook or Tweeting about it.
