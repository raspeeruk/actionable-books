  ### Are you a consumer or a creator?


  > "The enemy is called ‘Consumerism’."- The Tools, page 190


  We have a choice: Do we want to live our lives **consuming** or **creating**?


  A consumer limits the kinds of opportunities they create for themselves
  because they can’t genuinely connect with others. The focus is on having and
  gaining rather than giving and serving; too much on the external world and not
  enough attention to what’s really going on inside the individual.


  Being a consumer means we’re focused on what’s outside of us and how we can
  obtain it. The bigger problem then becomes that once we have it, we’re not
  satisfied. We want more.


  What really struck me was that being a consumer is not all about unhealthy
  wants. It’s not all about having the newest car or phone. It can be based on
  things that, without looking intentionally, can seem healthy: reading,
  listening to podcasts, networking.


  The challenge with being a consumer is that we take in more and more
  information but we don’t allow that information to actually change us in
  anyway. The focus is on quantity, not quality.


  As a consumer, we believe that the magical pill–that thing that will change
  our lives, fix our problems, or improve our relationships–is somewhere in our
  external world, rather than realizing that it’s within us and has been this
  whole time.


  The creator, on the other hand, doesn’t allow that to be true. The creator is
  more intentional in what he or she does and focuses on the outcome being
  something that impacts the world in a positive way. It could be something like
  reading a specific book because it will help you solve a specific problem in
  your workplace or relationship. The creator has an awareness of how what he or
  she does impacts his internal and external world.


  Where consumerism is often about quick, convenient, and being in control,
  being a creator is about intentionality, thoughtfulness, and being open to
  what comes.

  ### The Price of Negativity: The Black Cloud


  > "In the Black Cloud, every problem is of life-and-death importance–but no
  one can see this but you. You can’t trust anyone to help with your problems
  because no one takes them as seriously as you do. Inevitably you’re left
  feeling overwhelmed and alone."- The Tools, page 148


  We’ve all heard of the power of positivity: That by thinking positively about
  the circumstances of our lives the result will be that it becomes easier, more
  fulfilling and meaningful.


  Stutz and Michels call that out. They suggest that though it would be nice to
  think that our positive thoughts are more powerful than our negative thoughts,
  they aren’t. It’s a lot easier to let go and allow that worry to carry us away
  than it is to hold tight to the positive when everything around you is out of
  control. We worry.


  We worry because we fear that we won’t be taken care of or looked after. We
  worry because we believe it gives us control of the situation.


  The books calls that kind of worrying and negativity “the Black Cloud”. In
  order to address this head on and to move through the Black Cloud we have to
  start to understand that our experiences have the power to change our
  perspectives.


  But how can someone change their perspective when all of their experiences
  seem to be negative?


  Gratefulness is the key. Stutz and Michels suggest that Gratefulness is much
  more than just an emotion, it’s a way of perceiving things you never thought
  you could before. Not only do they help you understand this, the tool provides
  you with a process to actually create more gratefulness in your life in a
  tangible way.

  ### Willpower comes from a fear of losing it all


  > "A sense of purpose doesn’t come from thinking about it. It comes from
  taking action that moves you toward the future. The moment you do this, you
  activate a force more powerful than the desire to avoid pain.A sense of
  purpose doesn’t come from thinking about it. It comes from taking action that
  moves you toward the future. The moment you do this, you activate a force more
  powerful than the desire to avoid pain."- The Tools, page 33


  There’s an inherent flaw with most of the self-help books out on the market
  these days: they identify the problem, provide a thorough and comprehensive
  program, but few discuss what happens after you finish the book. Even fewer
  acknowledge how difficult it is to create that change in ourselves and how
  hard it can be to stick it out.


  The book straight out tell us that as human beings we will always be a work in
  progress.


  Stutz and Michels tell us that if we’re going to stick it out, we need to be
  constantly connecting to something bigger than ourselves.


  That’s where this concept of **Jeopardy** comes in.


  Jeopardy (with a capital “J”) is the feeling that at any moment, we can lose
  it all: a career, a relationship, a life. And that knowing this is a positive
  thing.


  It’s not intended to scare or demotivate. It actually does the opposite. It
  energizes and pushes us forward toward our fullest potential. By having an
  awareness that nothing is permanent and that our time on this world is
  limited, It’s a reminder to get our butt off the couch and get started on that
  project we’ve been putting off or tell that special someone how we really
  feel.


  It’s more than just a tool to keep ourselves motivated, it’s a way of living
  our life to it’s fullest potential.
f_conclusion: >-
  One of the things that I was really impressed by in The Tools was how
  confident and uncompromising the authors are in their belief in these tools.
  In fact, they go as far as to call out the reader and challenge you to be a
  creator rather than a consumer of this information. It’s inspiring and not
  something I’ve often come across.

> What if every bad thing that’s ever happened to you–including every problem you’ve ever had–was there, in your life, to get you in touch with abilities you never knew you had? _\- The Tools, page 235_

In _The Tools_, Phil Stutz and Barry Michels (two impressively well-educated and accomplished professionals in the fields of psychiatry and psychotherapy) bring forward a new approach to self-help.

This book is written in a way that connects you not just to the tools or strategies that they share, but to the authors themselves. They include lots of personal stories, triumphs and failures in regards to how they have used the tools in their own lives.

The book focuses on how we must not only change our attitudes when dealing with our problems, but also must change our behaviours.

It’s a powerful book.

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Are you a consumer or a creator?

We have a choice: Do we want to live our lives **consuming** or **creating**?

A consumer limits the kinds of opportunities they create for themselves because they can’t genuinely connect with others. The focus is on having and gaining rather than giving and serving; too much on the external world and not enough attention to what’s really going on inside the individual.

Being a consumer means we’re focused on what’s outside of us and how we can obtain it. The bigger problem then becomes that once we have it, we’re not satisfied. We want more.

What really struck me was that being a consumer is not all about unhealthy wants. It’s not all about having the newest car or phone. It can be based on things that, without looking intentionally, can seem healthy: reading, listening to podcasts, networking.

The challenge with being a consumer is that we take in more and more information but we don’t allow that information to actually change us in anyway. The focus is on quantity, not quality.

As a consumer, we believe that the magical pill–that thing that will change our lives, fix our problems, or improve our relationships–is somewhere in our external world, rather than realizing that it’s within us and has been this whole time.

The creator, on the other hand, doesn’t allow that to be true. The creator is more intentional in what he or she does and focuses on the outcome being something that impacts the world in a positive way. It could be something like reading a specific book because it will help you solve a specific problem in your workplace or relationship.

Where consumerism is often about quick, convenient, and being in control, being a creator is about intentionality, thoughtfulness, and being open to what comes.

In fact, they go as far as to call out the reader and challenge you to be a creator rather than a consumer of this information. It’s inspiring and not something I’ve often come across.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book as there were ample real life application opportunities and it was easy to take a tool that the authors shared and apply it into my own personal life. Though I know there’s still lots of work to do on myself (we’re all works in progress after all), I know this will be a book I come back to time after time when I find myself struggling to bring more courage, creativity or willpower into my life.
