  ### Operator or Owner?


  > "The problem with being a great operator is that you don't get rich, you get
  tired. Great business owners get rich."- The Ultimate Blueprint, page 2


  Do you often feel as though your business is running you? Do you find yourself
  tired and frustrated because of your business? Are you concerned about the
  long-term viability of the business you own? If you answered yes to any of
  these questions you are probably a great business operator instead of a great
  business owner. In _The Ultimate Blueprint for an Insanely Successful
  Business_ the author shares specifically what great business owners measure,
  monitor, and adjust so they can stay successful over the long run. He compares
  learning and executing these skills with the process of going to a doctor for
  a physical. The doctor giving the physical knows how to locate and correct the
  systemic problems in the patient’s body. Similarly, a business owner who
  understands and uses the principles taught in this book could locate and
  correct the systemic problems in the business. By reading and implementing the
  strategies taught in this book the business owner can become more competitive,
  add value, make better decisions, be more efficient, and ultimately make more
  money.

  ### Revenues and Profits


  > "The Ultimate Blueprint is to acquire or employ assets that are highly
  effective at producing revenue and then efficiently convert those revenues
  into profits."- The Ultimate Blueprint, page 50


  Profits are a theory, cash is a fact. The equation that this book is based
  upon is “Assets (more effective) –> Revenue (more efficient) –> Profits (more
  productive) –> Cash Flow or Operating Cash.”


  For example, in his successful lawn care business, my son focused on
  minimizing the monetary outlay for the equipment (_assets_) he needed to
  produce the maximum amount of _revenue_. Once he had _revenue,_ he strove to
  minimize his expenses to maximize the business _profits_. Finally, he focused
  on maximizing the _cash_ that his profits produced.


  Here are some key formulas from the book for measuring the effectiveness,
  efficiency, and productivity of a business:


  *   revenues / assets = effectiveness %

  *   profits / revenue = efficiency %

  *   operating cash flow / profits = productivity %


  What is the effectiveness, efficiency, and the productivity of your business
  using these formulas? How do your numbers compare with previous quarters or
  years? Can you find ways to increase profitability by decreasing expenses in
  your business? The bottom line is that for your business to be sustainable, it
  must produce positive cash flow from the operations of the business.

  ### Are You Measuring What Matters?


  > "What gets measured is what gets done. What gets measured is what gets
  managed."- The Ultimate Blueprint, page 19


  Have you realized that the person or business owner who does not want to
  measure probably does not want to be held accountable? Without measuring how
  will you know if you are improving or getting worse, and what to do about it
  once you know? The author proposes the following steps to creating the
  business results you desire:


  *   Measure to get clear on where you currently are.

  *   Decide where you want to go; make that your specific goal.

  *   Identify the root problem or cause that is blocking your progress.

  *   Fix the problem or remove the cause.

  *   Measure again to determine your progress toward your goal.


  I challenge you to implement these steps in your business and see what
  results. Be the one who measures and improves, not the one who doesn’t.
f_conclusion: >-
  I think the purpose of this book is clear – to highlight and emphasize the
  strategies and techniques available for each business owner to optimize and
  maximize profits and cash flow. Keith Cunningham does a good job of
  encouraging business owners to 1) invest in themselves – because that is the
  key to personal growth, 2) learn critical distinctions so better choices can
  be made – which is the key to a better life, and 3) do whatever it takes to
  create excellence, mastery, and contribution – which are keys to fulfillment
  in life and business. How are you doing in these three areas?

> "The goal of owning a business isn’t just to be successful, it’s to be successful and stay that way." _\- The Ultimate Blueprint, page 2_

_The Ultimate Blueprint for an Insanely Successful Business_ was recommended to me by a prosperous business owner, who qualified it as “very helpful”. The title certainly hooked me since I’ve always wanted to have a successful business and I love following proven processes, or blueprints. This is not a book filled with abstract theories but of proven principles. The reader who would benefit most from reading it is one who already owns or runs a business. Currently, that is not my case. However, I have gleaned important insights nonetheless and will attempt to summarize some key principles using some fictitious examples along the way to help illustrate some of the points offered in the book.

Candid and even blunt at times, Keith Cunningham reveals his core business principles, including why great operators get tired and how great business owners get rich. The book outlines critical skills, tools, and strategies required to drive profits and maximize cash flow for any business, regardless of the size or the industry. You cannot create and sustain business success without the appropriate business skills and tools. When you get the tools that work, you get the results that are possible.
