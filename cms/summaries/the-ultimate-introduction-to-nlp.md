  ### It’s Like You’re Attending a Workshop


  > "A good map is a map that gets you to see things from different perspectives
  and that helps you feel as resourceful as possible about your situation."- The
  Ultimate Introduction to NLP, page 14


  Meet Joe. We will track him as he attends a one-day introductory course with
  Dr. Bandler, listens to Richard teaching, practices the techniques and learns
  with fellow participants how to apply the content personally as well as
  professionally.


  To begin, we discover the basics. In order to understand our world, we need to
  realize that we map it in our brains through three basic processes. First, we
  _delete_ part of the information (just as we would not draw on a city map what
  the cars look like). Next, we _generalize_ (when you see a blue shape, you
  expect it to be a lake or sea). Last, we _distort_ part of the information.
  For instance, a subtle way people distort things is to attach meaning to
  something that happened or to something that someone said/did.


  To have better options, feelings and interactions with others, we need to
  expand our maps. We must look at the same things from different perspectives.
  Instead of generalizing our experiences and projecting them into the future,
  we would be wise to realize (for example) that not all people will stab us in
  the back.

  ### Building a Better Future


  > "How good can you feel for no reason whatsoever?"- The Ultimate Introduction
  to NLP, page 34


  Having released what is not working, how about we concentrate on what we DO
  desire for our lives? Here’s the process:


  1.  Allow your breathing to slow down. Let yourself go effortlessly into a
  state of comfort.

  2.  Imagine time stretched out in front of you and behind you. See yourself
  drifting above your timeline and looking down on your past, present and
  future.

  3.  As you look down, you can see all those times you had a bad experience. As
  you do so, you realize each was a training ground for your future success.

  4.  Notice the useful information that emerges from each of those experiences.
  Take that “light” with you and leave the rest behind, in the past, where it
  belongs.

  5.  Next, think of a time when you were feeling on top of the world. Immerse
  yourself in that situation and let that fantastic sensation grow. Move it
  through your body.

  6.  Take this feeling, give it a colour of your choice and imagine it spraying
  through your past so that it covers every negative memory and bad experience.

  7.  Imagine looking down and realizing how good you feel about those past
  experiences. Whatever troubled you is now behind you and getting farther away
  by the second.

  8.  As you feel good about your past, imagine looking down at your future.
  Picture the best kinds of feelings raining down on it. See your future looking
  better than ever.

  9.  Float slowly back into your body. Feel full of excitement and anticipation
  for your most amazing future – full of new people, opportunities and
  possibilities.

  ### Get Rid of Bad Memories


  > "The important thing is this: when you get rid of that problem, what are you
  going to do with all of the spare time that you’ll have?"- The Ultimate
  Introduction to NLP, page 107


  Distilled, here is a sequence of steps by which to eliminate negative
  associations:


  1.  Think of something that recently happened to you and that still bothers
  you – something you don’t want to think of anymore. Focus on the visual
  representation of the memory – the image or movie that you see in your mind’s
  eye.

  2.  Take that picture, make it smaller, move it off into the distance and
  drain the colour plus brightness out of it.

  3.  If you hear the voices and sounds of the scene, make them fade away.

  4.  Make the picture so small you have to squint to see what’s in there, and
  then make it even smaller.

  5.  When it’s the size of a breadcrumb, you can just brush it away.


  There! How was that? Easy…right?

  The promise of this book is to give us the tools to change our lives. We’re
  enabled to overcome the things that are holding us back – the phobias,
  depression, habits, psychosomatic illnesses and learning disorders.

  And it doesn’t necessarily match the map of the people around you."
