  ### The One Sure Path to Success: Delight Your Customers


  > "The only way to grow is to treat customers so well they come back for more,
  and tell their friends about us."- Andy Taylor, CEO of Enterprise, quoted in
  The Ultimate Question 2.0, page 36


  These days there is more emphasis than ever on customer centricity. And it’s
  no wonder. The internet empowers customers to not only find all the
  information they need but to share their experiences. They are in charge.


  Additionally, good leaders understand that most talented employees want more
  than a J-O-B. They want to pursue a mission, a purpose that transcends profits
  and shareholders. Being customer centered creates more meaning and
  satisfaction for the employees.


  Have you ever felt however that your organizational leaders talk out of both
  sides of their mouths? They claim they want to be customer focused yet the
  culture remains staunchly profit-centric, ruled by quarterly financial
  objectives and accounting metrics.


  Despite all the talk companies have had about being customer focused and
  creating a purpose for their people, the vast majority haven’t made much
  progress. Reichheld shows us with many examples of companies that have grasped
  the Net Promoter System are finding their way.

  ### Learn from those who have gone before us: 3 keys to success


  > "Becoming truly customer-centric and turning customers into promoters is a
  very long journey. ‘It’s as much about culture change as it is about
  organizational design and metrics.’ Says Guerrino De Luca, chairman of
  Logitech."- The Ultimate Question 2.0, page 224


  We can benefit and learn from those who have walked before us. Reichheld
  discovered that in virtually every successful application of the system,
  whenever NPS helped produce extraordinary improvements, the following three
  characteristics were prevalent:


  1) Senior leadership teams and specifically the CEO made it a mission-critical
  priority. They embraced the improvement of customer loyalty through NPS. Why?
  They understood that being customer driven is morally imperative and creates
  profit simultaneously.


  2) They wove NPS into the fabric of daily and monthly priorities. NPS customer
  feedback was hardwired into key decision processes up and down the
  organization.


  3) Companies organized the NPS initiative as a long journey of cultural change
  and growth rather than a short-term project. They understood that NPS had to
  touch every part of the organization for it to generate profitable,
  sustainable growth.

  ### We want to be customer driven... but how?


  > "If organizations take seriously the goal of turning customers into
  promoters, then they must take seriously the need to measure their success."-
  The Ultimate Question 2.0, page 123


  Are you ready to be obsessed with your mission to be customer driven – to
  enrich the lives of your customers? Here is a snapshot of the necessary steps
  to obtain measurement consistently.


  1) Use the question: **“_How likely would you recommend us (or our product or
  service) to your friends or colleagues on a scale from 0–10?”_** You can
  follow it up with **“_What is the primary reason for the score you just gave
  us?”_**


  2) Categorize the results:


  *   Scores of 9-10 – Promoters. These people are suggesting that their lives
  have been enriched by their relationship with you/the company. They are loyal
  and may talk up the company to their colleagues. They represent good profits
  and sustainable growth.

  *   Scores of 7-8 – Passives. These people are passively satisfied and not
  loyal. They wouldn’t likely talk enthusiastically to others about you. They
  have not been “delighted” yet.

  *   Scores of 6 or less – Detractors. These people are dissatisfied,
  disaffected or even dismayed by how they are treated. They may talk badly
  about you/the company. This represents an opportunity to discover the problem,
  apologize and solve the problem.


  3) Close the loop – Shortly after the score is obtained, managers should
  engage passives and detractors in dialogue around their experience that led to
  the score. They could ask **_“What is the most important improvement that
  would make you more likely to recommend us?”_**


  4) Celebrate success and share best practice – Managers should share the
  promoters’ comments with all to acknowledge great work and teach others
  through example. This stimulates the journey to customer centricity.
f_conclusion: >-
  Everyone wants to make a profit and many want to leave a legacy. The real
  magic happens for those who realize it’s reversed. Create a legacy of caring
  about customers and employees, a legacy of enriching the lives you touch and
  the profits with follow. Once you accept this and want to achieve and measure
  it, learn everything you can about the Net Promoter System. It’s not just a
  way of thinking but a practical guide; a blueprint for long-term growth and
  success. It’s indispensable.

If you want to impact people and increase sales simultaneously and you suspect that being customer driven is key to your success then read on! In this summary I share my three key takeaways from _The Ultimate Question 2.0_ and I also recommend you read the book since there are many more lessons to be had!

Let’s start with what a ‘Net Promoter Score’ is for those who have not yet heard of it. If you have ever been asked “_How likely would you recommend us (our product or service) on a scale from 0–10?_” then you have been served by a company that has benefitted from the wisdom of Fred Reichheld and Rob Markey. In 2003 he shared the Net Promoter Score (NPS) as a new way to measure how well an organization treats its customers and how well it builds relationships that lead to loyalty.

While at first I questioned why an entire book was required to explain one magical question, I was delighted to learn that the question is just the tip of the iceberg. There is so much more we can learn! Reichheld and Markey share lessons from those who have gone before us and had tremendous success transforming their organizations based on the NPS.

Thousands of innovative companies (Apple, American Express, Allianz, Philips, GE, eBay, Facebook, LEGO, and Southwest Airlines) began using Net Promoter scores to track loyalty, engagement, and enthusiasm of their customers. They liked how easy it was and how it focused everyone on one inspirational goal – to treat customers so well that they become promoters.

Though the science is still young, users have evolved it such that it has become a management system, an entire way of doing business. The initials themselves, NPS, have come to mean Net Promoter _system_ rather than just Net Promoter score.

This system of management **helps executives focus the entire organization on turning customers into promoters;** customers who come back for more and bring their friends. Who doesn’t want that? A great side effect from that outcome is that **employees are energized** because they feel proud of how they’ve treated their customers.
