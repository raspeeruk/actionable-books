  ### Perfectly Irrationally Rational


  > "We are often unaware of how these irrationalities influence us, which means
  that we don’t fully understand what drives our behaviour."- The Upside of
  Irrationality, page 288


  Seeing as it’s just a few weeks after the beginning of the year, let’s talk
  about New Year’s Resolutions. Did you make any? I know I did. And they’re
  logical ones too – go to the gym at least three times a week, rotate the genre
  of books I’m reading and incorporate more literature into my selections –
  things like that. I also made resolutions around work and balance in my life,
  deciding to focus less on working around the clock and more on time and stress
  management. All important and worthwhile goals, I’d say. But here’s the thing
  – I know all these resolutions will make me more well-rounded and make my life
  healthier and happier in the long run but in my short-term thinking, I have a
  hard time seeing that long term benefit.


  Like putting gas in the car, our short-term actions have potential devastating
  effects on our long-term selves. If we skip one workout at the gym this week,
  that’s just a small glitch in the fitness plan and won’t make a huge
  difference in overall health. But if we’re able to rationalize missing one
  workout this week, we’re likely able to find an excuse to miss maybe two
  workouts a week in a month, and possibly, a few months from now, we’ll have
  found something entirely different to do with the time we should be at the
  gym. And 15 years from now, we’ll all be thicker, jigglier version of our
  former selves! But today, I can rationalize the missed workout, without much
  consideration of that girl 15 years from now. It isn’t until we recognize that
  irrational thinking, understand our motivations behind it and then invent or
  create new ways to behave, that these changes will be sustainable.

  ### The Wisdom to Know the Difference


  > "...rather than strive for perfect rationality, we need to appreciate those
  imperfections that benefit us, recognize the ones we would like to overcome,
  and design the world around us in a way that takes advantage of our incredible
  abilities while overcoming some of our limitations."- The Upside of
  Irrationality, page 294


  When Dan Ariely was 18 years old, he suffered a horrible accident that left
  third-degree burns over 70% of his body. Not only did his skin suffer but
  almost every other part of his body was also affected, not the least of which
  was his right arm, swollen so much “that the pressure was preventing blood
  flow to (my) hand.” After months of treatment, the arm hadn’t improved and the
  doctors came to their best, logical conclusion – the arm should be amputated
  below the elbow. Ariely, however, chose the “irrational” option of keeping his
  arm and make the best of his limited limb. Doing the cost/benefit analysis
  now, many, many years in the future, Ariely says he’s not sure he made the
  right long-term decision as he still suffers greatly from pain and ongoing
  treatments for his arm, but he doesn’t regret the decision he made as the
  alternative wasn’t an option in his mind. He’s adapted, found ways to overcome
  his limitations using a support network of people as well as various
  electronic devices for transcribing and typing. This is the important part of
  making outwardly irrational decisions – accepting that they’ve been made,
  appreciating the reasons and emotional places they came from and learning to
  distinguish the right decisions from the wrong ones so we can change the
  outcome next time.


  So far, I haven’t run out of gas in my car. It’s almost like a little game for
  me now, trying to see how far I can push the limits of my vehicle before
  getting myself stranded on the side of the road. A little irrationality I’m
  prepared to accept for the secret thrill it gives me when I make it to the gas
  station. But this is the thing – it’s the balance between the irrational
  decisions and the rational ones that make the real difference in our lives.
  Recognizing that there are decisions we’re going to make because it feels
  right at the time, and may not seem like the logical choice, but we’re going
  to make them anyways. It is the intention of _The Upside of Irrationality_ and
  the experiences Dan Ariely talks about in this book, to ask us only to think,
  experiment, and change our behaviours as a result of these activities, to
  positively affect future decisions.


  But now please excuse me – my low fuel light is on.

  ### The Audacity of Assumption


  > "It is very difficult to make really big, important, life-changing decisions
  because we are all susceptible to a formidable array of decision biases."- The
  Upside of Irrationality, page 287


  As a researcher, Dan Ariely doesn’t trust his gut or “how things have always
  been done” – he goes out and proves whether those assumptions are correct
  using studies and experiments. Ariely believes that doubting our intuition and
  assumptions is the only way to correct mistakes and stem the flow of wasted
  time, energy and resources and, that by questioning why and how we do things,
  we might actually “discover when and how we are wrong and improve the ways we
  love, live, work, innovate, manage and govern.”


  Think about the last big decision you made – how’d that turn out? Were you
  successful in achieving the goal the decision was intended to accomplish? Did
  the people involved respond how you expected them to respond? After it was all
  said and done and any subsequent activities were completed as result of your
  decision, were you still satisfied it was the right choice? What would you do
  differently next time in this situation and how would that change the outcome?
  This is the process Ariely is talking about; questioning our decisions and
  testing the assumptions to see if we’re making those choices for the right
  reasons and in the right ways or just “doing things they way they’ve always
  been done” for the sake of tradition or expectation.

I despise stopping to put gas in my car. Seriously, even after the low fuel light comes on my dash, I will drive around for another 30kms before finally pulling into a gas station, practically running on fumes, and fill up the car. The inconvenience of stopping, paying my hard earned money just to keep the car moving seems like such an interruption in my day that I won’t do it until I absolutely need to. Yes, I realize that’s totally irrational behaviour, that my car obviously won’t move unless it has gas it in and the convenience of having my car to get from A to B is the preferred option but still, I wait until the last possible second. It’s this type of irrational thought process – the obvious ridiculousness in my logic – that Dan Ariely talks about in his newest book, _The Upside of Irrationality_. Ariely is a researcher of Behavioural Economics, the study of how people behave, and in this book, his research focuses on the decisions we make and why we make them, even if they’re not always in our best interest.

It’s important for us to understand why we make the decisions we do so that we can correct the ways in which we fail and find more effective ways to overcome our mistakes. This is the science behind Behavioural Economics, helping us “gain control over our money, relationships, safety, and health, both as individuals and as a society.”
