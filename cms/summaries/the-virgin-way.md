  ### Don’t complain, invent


  > "Sometimes, rather than sitting back and complaining about lousy service, it
  really pays to get out there and find a way to improve upon it by reinventing
  it yourself."- The Virgin Way, page 162


  Branson’s philosophy is to never settle for mediocre. Without having any
  knowledge of the aviation business, he recognized there was a gap in service
  levels of some of the world’s biggest airlines. Rather than complaining about
  the inevitable, Branson saw an opportunity to create change. This optimistic
  and possibility-filled outlook has brought him to the forefront of some major
  successes, but also some failures (cue Virgin Cola and a condom business).
  With a ‘can’t win ‘em all’ attitude, Branson admits his short-sightedness in
  his failures and focuses on where his thirst for invention, or rather
  re-invention, has benefited not just him, but large communities of people.


  So how exactly does one manage such a vast group of diverse businesses? It’s
  all in the Insights.

  ### Create an entrepreneur culture


  > "No matter how visionary, brilliant and far-reaching a leader’s strategy
  might be, it can, and frequently does, all go for naught if it is not fully
  supported by a healthy and spirited corporate culture."- The Virgin Way, page
  227


  If you haven’t picked up on it already, Branson is not one to place importance
  on corporate hierarchies, titles, or silos. He truly views the role of leader
  as that of an enabler – an individual who provides what is needed for work to
  get done, supports ideas, and listens from the bottom up. In this sense,
  leaders create “interpreneurs” who take on their roles as if they owned the
  company themselves.


  “Incredible results can flow from vision and leadership coming together in one
  inspired individual with the assistance of an army of equally inspired
  followers,” Branson writes.


  Creating this sort of culture, Branson says, involves checking egos at the
  door, being open-minded, and letting go of control. It also involves creating
  a space for employees to feel comfortable expressing themselves, with no fear
  of judgment or punishment. Had Branson not created this culture of acceptance
  amongst his various Boards and business partners, few of the companies that
  make up the Virgin Group would exist today.

  ### Get the right people enrolled


  > "Going it alone is an admirable but foolhardy and highly flawed approach to
  taking on the world."- The Virgin Way, page 288


  Whether it’s employees, business partners, or mentors, Branson’s stance on
  extraordinary success is that it does not come to individuals alone. In his
  40+ years in business, Branson has discovered that great leaders can show up
  at any place at any time, so he encourages his readers to always be prepared.


  “You can never tell where your next leaders are going to come from,” he
  explains. “We find great leaders everywhere: some working hard inside our
  companies, others working for large competitors, or sometimes they just walk
  in on us right out of the blue.”


  Titles and position in a hierarchy are no indicator of an individual’s
  innovation and leadership abilities, so place less importance on those details
  and more on getting to know the people around you. Seek mentors who have done
  the kind of work you are looking to do, people who have succeeded but also
  people who have failed – their stories will be enlightening and quite
  insightful. How else would he have managed to create a completely new airline
  that is now a big player in the world’s aviation game?


  Learn to delegate. Admit where you have weaknesses and find the people who
  will fill the gaps for you. The next step is very important: _allow_ the
  people you enroll to take control and accountability for their roles. Once you
  have the people in place, it’s the culture you create that will support your
  outrageous visions, and empower your people to help you reach your goals.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Virgin Way_ puts an edgy, in-your-face lens on entrepreneurship and the
  fundamental role of a leader. Branson’s storytelling makes his philosophies
  relatable, and puts a spotlight on the beauty of being an authentic, no BS
  leader. I have to admit, there are some tangents in the book that made the
  read feel a lot longer than it should have, but at the end of it all,
  Branson’s quirky, unreasonable, and purely optimistic approach leaves the
  reader encouraged to “screw it,” and just “do it.” After all, anything is
  possible, isn’t it?

> "What routinely fools a Goliath is when, instead of going after their market share, someone instead goes out to create a whole new niche market right under their imperious nose." _\- The Virgin Way, page 157_

Serial entrepreneur Richard Branson has certainly mastered the craft of finding niche markets. From his first venture at the age of 16 with _Student_ magazine to the creation of Virgin Records, Virgin Airlines, Virgin Mobile, and more, Branson admits he couldn’t have seen the billion-dollar success he sees today without enlisting the help of others. “Hire your weaknesses” he encourages in _The Virgin Way – Everything I Know About Leadership_, after all, an individual who plans to take on the world cannot possibly do it on his own. Through vibrant storytelling, personal accounts of success and failure, and punchy, to-the-point chapters, in 381 pages Branson reveals his core leadership values, his “Screw It, Let’s Do It” approach to business, and his utmost and utter respect for the people who have helped him (and continue to help him) along the way. Branson’s focus on relationship-building, community involvement, corporate culture, and of course having lots of fun, is refreshing – these are authentic aspects of business building that we don’t often hear the big wigs placing importance on, though they have been Branson’s core values from the beginning.
