  ### Focus Your Energy On What You Can Control


  > "Champions fully grasp the difference between what they can and can’t
  control in an event or life situation, and choose to focus on the former."-
  The Way of the Champion, page vi


  As you learn about the mental habits and practices of The Champion, there is
  one key principle to keep in mind: Focus Your Energy on What You Can Control.


  It’s easy to get caught up with results and outcomes.  

  With winning or losing. With hitting that “million dollar” sales mark.


  But it’s crucial to understand that once you’ve set your goal, your focus
  needs to shift to the process of achieving that goal. Your focus needs to
  shift to the things _you can control_ to help achieve that goal.


  _“Focus away from the results and more on the process. Focusing on the results
  creates anxiety,  

  stress, and a good deal of tension. Focusing on the process allows you to
  relax and  

  feel confident in what you can do.”_


  You truly cannot guarantee the specific outcome or result of any event in
  life.  

  But you can control how you think, act and behave on a daily basis at any
  given moment.


  Here are two methods to help sharpen your focus.

  ### Practice Your I.P.R. (Instant Positive Response)


  > "I train athletes to do this by using their meditation technique to
  visualize, each day, circumstances that cause negative reactions, and to
  ‘feel’ themselves responding in positive ways."- The Way of the Champion, page
  68


  Whenever we’re faced with challenging times or blind-sided by an unexpected
  event, it’s easy to get caught up in the external circumstances, and forget
  about the things that are in our control. It’s easy to get caught up in how
  “bad” the situation seems to be.


  But, as Jerry explains in _The Way of the Champion_, it’s important to
  practice our I.P.R. (Instant Positive Response) during these times.


  Whenever you experience a mistake, error, setback or failure, take a deep
  breath and remind yourself that you are still in control of your thoughts,
  actions and behaviors in that moment. And then shift focus to what you can do,
  in that moment, to learn from, and face the challenges and bounce back from
  the perceived setback.


  In fact, Jerry takes this one step further by recommending a daily meditative
  practice where you visualize the circumstances that cause negative reactions,
  and to _feel_ yourself responding in positive ways. You can use the steps
  explained above to find your still point for this practice as well – just
  replace step 5 with the IPR practice.

  ### Find Your Still Point


  > "To fulfill the advice of this Tao wisdom, I help all of my athletes and
  clients to practice MINDFULNESS, a way or system to help quiet the mind
  (meditate), calm the body, and marinate the nervous system in positive images
  and self-talk."- The Way of the Champion, page 61


  Knowing you should be focusing on the things you can control is one thing, and
  actually doing it is another. With all the distractions we have in this day
  and age, it’s easy to forget about what we “should be doing”; what with our
  constantly ringing cell phones, updating social media streams, and wanting to
  squeeze more out of every minute.


  This is where the Tao state of mind, _the still point_, comes in. It’s a
  practice that’s been used by champion athletes such as Tiger Woods and
  championship teams such as the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers.


  Do the following with eyes closed to find your still point:


  1\. Breathe in slowly through your nostrils, and as you do, feel the coolness
  of the air coming as it fills your lungs. Imagine the breath going to all
  parts of the body.


  2\. When your lungs are filled to capacity, hold or suspend your breath for
  five seconds.


  3\. Slowly exhale through the nostrils, and as you do, feel the warmth of the
  air as it exits the body.


  4\. Repeat this process seven or eight times, focusing on the alternating
  cool/warm temperatures of the breath. Notice how, with each breathe, you begin
  to get more deeply relaxed.


  5\. In this relaxed state, introduce images of success along with words,
  phrases, and affirmations that positively nurture, reinforce, encourage, and
  support who you are and what you do and where you desire to go. **_Be sure to
  focus on the process – on the things you can control – rather than purely the
  end results and outcomes._**


  6\. The whole process takes only seven to ten minutes each day.

  _The Way of the Champion_ is more than a personal development and leadership
  book – it’s a personal guide on your journey as a Champion.

  "You see, a champion is never something you become… ever. It starts now by
  acting as a champion, committing yourself to practicing the habits and ways of
  a champion, choosing to engage in a lifestyle that demonstrates such qualities

Looking back on his experience working with championship teams and athletes, sports psychologist and international speaker Jerry Lynch shares the habits and practices that separate the _would-be_ champions from _The_ _Champions_ in _The Way of the Champion_.

At the heart of his strategy is the teaching of Sun Tzu’s _The Art of War_ and other Tao wisdom, which he explains with the contributions of Chungliang Al Huang, an internationally recognized authority on the Tao.

But, _The Way of the Champion_ does more than just share the mental habits and lifestyle of a Champion.

Perhaps the greatest benefit is the personal journey you take throughout the book, as you become more self-aware by answering and reflecting on the “Questions on the Quest” at the end of every chapter. These questions are meant to not only review the lessons learned, but also help you on your journey as a champion as you become more aware of where you are now, and where you’d like to get to.

And there’s one particular principle that stands out from the rest.
