  ### Disruptive brand building


  > "There can be no greater marketing sin then underleveraging a brand."- The
  Ways to New, page 140


  _The Ways to New_ is unashamedly a book about disruptive approaches to
  marketing. The author’s ideas and examples of successful innovation
  demonstrate why “we should never forget that brands that do not see the future
  coming usually do not have one.”


  Using relevant case studies on companies from a range of industries such as
  Burberry, Airbnb, Alibaba and Salesforce, the book explains how businesses,
  who have successfully driven growth using innovation did not just limit their
  inspiration to the creation of disruptive products and services.


  Your brand is one of the most valuable assets your business has. ‘Disruptive
  Brand Building’ can help you to focus your marketing and advertising efforts
  in such a way that your brand vision is unmistakable. Recognised by your
  target audience, and, adopted heart and soul by your employees.


  Companies with a clear and defined idea of what their brand represents, are
  able to disrupt consumer categories and their competition. Gatorade sports
  drink for instance, is a brand that believes “athletic performance comes from
  within”. While Airbnb’s vision is to create a world of hospitality “where
  strangers don’t exist anymore”. Both are powerful, unique brand building
  concepts.


  In a digital world, filled with copycat products and services, plus numerous
  ways consumers can receive advertising messages from businesses, defining a
  strong brand vision that is communicated in conjunction with an innovative
  approach, may well be the new path to disruption you’ve been looking for.

  ### What if


  > "These questions are thought-provoking, often intrusive, but at the same
  time, if you look at the whole run of them, they will give an impression of
  being erratic, even incongruous and with no way of logic."- The Ways to New,
  page 16


  A “beautiful question”, according to acclaimed author Warren Berger, can
  change the way we look at or consider something. In _The Ways to New_, these
  type of situational questions are defined by Dru as “What If” questions.


  There are two essential criteria your “What if” needs to meet in order to add
  value to disruptive innovation thinking:


  1.  The **_conception_** of your “What if” question should be specific to
  people who have a complete understanding of your business or the situation.

  2.  The **_relevance_** of the “What if” question should be able to be
  understood by anyone, regardless of their involvement with your business or
  the situation.


  So this means, as you and your team start developing a disruptive, high-impact
  innovation strategy, you should make sure your brainstorming platform is a)
  inspired by real issues and events impacting your business, and b), that the
  unique idea pool you generate makes logical sense to stakeholders, potential
  partners and collaborators even if they are outside your business and/or
  industry.

  ### Ways to Innovate


  > "Most people innovate against or for. When they think change is needed or
  they believe they have something new to offer."- The Ways to New, page 8


  As a concept, ‘disruption’ in today’s business context often refers to
  start-up incubators and entrepreneurial ventures in the digital and tech
  space. This increasingly common, and, as Dru argues “narrow” view of the term
  may have led you to wonder how you can bring the idea of disruptive innovation
  into your organisation.


  _The Ways to New_, covers not one, but fifteen paths to innovation, almost all
  of which are digitally led. From popular **Open disruption** (crowdsourcing,
  community focused innovation) to **Sustainability-driven disruption** (social
  responsibility innovation), **Asset-based disruption** (infrastructure
  capability innovation), **Business model disruption** (transformation
  innovation) and more, it’s clear there is no shortage of ways to innovate.


  But which way suits businesses best? Well, particularly useful for getting
  started in defining an approach to driving innovation for any company, would
  be to apply TBWA’s specific three-step, “_Convention, Vision and Disruption”_
  method.


  You can do this during a strategic planning session, referred to by the
  author’s agency and clients worldwide as a ‘Disruption Day’. Using this
  approach, the idea is to:


  1.  **Innovate for:** Look for new ways your brand (vision) could provide a
  path to innovation.

  2.  **Innovate against**: Identify the rules, practices and conventions in
  your industry. As many as possible, no matter how seemingly insignificant. Any
  of which could be the launch pad for innovation.

  3.  **Innovate with:** Dream up unlikely partnerships. Impossible or
  unexpected joint ventures with other traditional and digital organisations who
  are also set for innovation.


  Whether innovating for, against or with, another useful supporting technique
  that will help your ‘way to new’, is to visualise (or even better, draw) three
  concentric circles, one inside the other. Ok. These represent your business.
  The centre circle represents your product, the next circle holds your business
  model; leaving the biggest circle to represent you marketing and advertising
  functions.


  No matter which way you begin to innovate, remember that these 3 key elements
  of your business should remain at the heart of all your innovation planning.

  The importance of marketing appears to have declined over the years. In _The
  Ways to New_, Author Jean-Marie Dru shares his agency’s long history of
  working with CEO’s who were uncertain of the contribution of marketing to the
  overall company strategy, then, with focus, disrupted their own business
  models and industries by bringing marketing and innovation back together. Rich
  with real-life case studies, this book will have you discovering ideas and
  questions about your own business you never dreamed of asking… until now.

  "Seeking inspiration from other industries or other companies demands hard
  work and insight. People need to understand exactly how and why their way of
  innovating is special, and thus grasp the key characteristic that defines
  their way of thinking and doing."
