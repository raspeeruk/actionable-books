  ### Don’t Get Too Comfortable


  > "Applying Whole Brain Thinking means being able to fully leverage one’s own
  preferences, stretch to other styles when necessary, and to adapt to and take
  advantage of the preferences of those around you to improve performance and
  results."- The Whole Brain Business Book, page 8


  You have probably heard of the popular left-brain right-brain distinction
  first described by Roger Sperry whereby the two hemispheres of our brain are
  responsible for different specialized functions – logic and creativity
  respectively. The Whole Brain model Ned Herrmann developed both builds on and
  debunks this dichotomy by describing four inter-connected thinking quadrants:


  A – **The Analyzer**: logical thinking, analysis of facts, processing numbers


  B – **The Organizer:** planning approaches, organizing facts, detailed review


  C – **The Personalizer:** interpersonal, intuitive, expressive


  D – **The Strategizer:** imaginative, big-picture thinking, conceptualizing


  The Herrmann’s research demonstrates that everyone has distinct preferences
  for one or more of these thinking styles. The important thing to understand
  about these preferences is that one is not better than another. Each style has
  context specific advantages and limitations. Sustainable business success is
  more likely when all four modes of thinking are utilized.


  Thus the advice of the The Big Idea – _Don’t Get Too Comfortable_. Be aware of
  your thinking preferences but don’t cling stubbornly to them as if they are
  infallible. Push yourself to think about issues and problems using your less
  preferred thinking modes. Or at least discuss them with people whose strengths
  align with those other thinking styles. Whole Brain thinking can reveal
  possibilities we may inadvertently overlook if we rely too heavily on our
  dominant thinking patterns.

  ### No One Is Smarter than Everyone


  > "We need to figure out how to listen for, and leverage, the differences in
  thinking on our teams, especially when we are facing tough new challenges."-
  The Whole Brain Business Book, page 210


  Self-awareness of our own thinking preferences and pushing ourselves to use
  our less-preferred quadrants will certainly improve our success rates in
  business and life. However, to truly unleash the full potential of our
  organizations (and families), we would be wise to tune into and then utilize
  the thinking styles of our co-workers and family members.


  Research has shown that _mentally diverse heterogeneous groups produce more
  creative, effective solutions than do similar-thinking homogeneous groups_. In
  an increasingly complex world that requires more innovative solutions to
  address its challenges, ensuring project teams have members representing all
  four thinking quadrants is critical. The drawback is that these teams will
  face communication challenges because their thinking preferences will clash.
  Team members will need to understand and appreciate the different thinking
  styles of their teammates before these differences can be leveraged to create
  more robust and effective solutions. This requires extra time and effort
  initially however is well worth the investment (recall insight #1).


  So when you find yourself getting frustrated with a family member or
  colleague, you may want to step back and consider if the clash is partially
  rooted in your different thinking styles. Acknowledging those differences and
  asking questions to better understand other perspectives can broaden your own
  thinking on the issue and lead to improved outcomes for all concerned.

  ### Exercise your Brain!


  > "You can work outside your zone of preference, but it will take an enormous
  amount of effort and motivation...just like working out at the gym."- The
  Whole Brain Business Book, page 35


  I can hear the collective groans of many of you at the thought of exercising
  your brain. Yet, just as our bodies need exercise to develop strength and
  resiliency, our brain also needs to flex its mental muscles. Developing your
  competencies and honing your expertise requires time and effort even in your
  natural areas of preference. And like physical exercise, incorporating mental
  calisthenics within your daily activities as well as setting aside time for
  dedicated practice will yield optimum results.


  Now before you totally disengage, keep in mind that you don’t have to develop
  Herculean strengths in all four thinking quadrants. The idea is to become just
  a little bit more comfortable using those less preferred thinking styles so
  you can leverage them more easily when the situation warrants. Not sure how to
  do that? Here are a few ideas from the book:


  **A Quadrant (Analytical)** – Define your work goals for the next quarter in
  terms of the return on time and investment; try some logic games like Soduko
  or KenKen


  **B Quadrant (Practical)** – Organize your filing system, inbox and workspace;
  prepare a detailed property list or work on your family tree


  **C Quadrant (Relational)** – Offer to mentor or coach a coworker on a company
  project; expand your playlist and take regular music breaks


  **D Quadrant (Experimental)** – set aside time for idea generation and think
  of at least one “crazy” idea per day; create a personal logo or slogan


  Remember, just like going to the gym, exercising underutilized thinking styles
  will feel awkward and uncomfortable initially and that’s ok! Keep at it. It
  will become easier the more you do it and you will reap the benefits.
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Whole Brain Business Book_ is both insightful and overwhelming. It
  affirms our core strengths and values yet forces us to acknowledge that our
  thinking is often faulty because we don’t always consider all the relevant
  data (the four quadrants) when making decisions. There is a lot to absorb and
  practice if we are truly interested in improving how we think and interact
  with others. The good news is the authors provide plenty of
  application-friendly exercises to guide our efforts. In my humble opinion,
  dedicating time to becoming more comfortable with Whole Brain Thinking is
  (pardon the pun) … a no-brainer!

Thinking. We all do it, albeit some better than others, and yet most of us take this capability for granted. We typically don’t spend much time thinking about how to improve how we think. Fortunately, there are people like Ned Herrmann and his daughter Ann who have spent their careers studying the brain, how people think, and how we can unleash our hidden wisdom through Whole Brain Thinking.

Ned’s curiosity about how the brain worked eventually resulted in the development of a diagnostic tool (the Herrmann Brain Dominance InstrumentR) which reveals an individual’s preference for four different thinking styles. I completed this assessment years ago as a participant in an intensive leadership program. The results were very insightful and generated some interesting conversations amongst my colleagues. So when I discovered _The Whole Brain Business Book (Second Edition)_, I knew it would be a fascinating read.

At 388 pages, this is not a book for the casual reader, although the material is well organized and you don’t need to read the entire book to glean helpful insights. Each chapter opens with a cartoon followed by 3-4 bullet points that sum up the key points. Real life scenarios illustrate the theoretical concepts and the authors include a “Put it to Work” section that helps readers apply the learnings to their own situations. If you are curious about understanding yourself and the people around you better, this book will definitely help.
