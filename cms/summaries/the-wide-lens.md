  ### Shift Your Focus


  > "Choosing to focus on the ecosystem, rather than simply on the immediate
  environment of innovation, changes everything – from how you prioritize
  opportunities and threats, to how you think about market timing and
  positioning, to how you define and measure success."- Wide Lens, page 6


  Steve Jobs was a true pioneer and innovation leader, a serial creator of
  successful products. He demonstrates in multiple examples what it takes to
  succeed in an interdependent world. And with good reason, for it wasn’t really
  the products that he created that were so revolutionary, but the way he
  created an ecosystem that produced the successes. In fact, in only one case
  was his product—the iPad—the first to market. The iPod and iPhone arrived much
  later than the competition in the same arenas. But as you will see, innovation
  is not about arriving first—It’s about making sure an ecosystem is ready at
  launch time.


  When you manage a project that relies on adoption chain partners delivering
  important pieces to your innovation, by assessing the entire ecosystem you
  will realize just how critical to success their efforts really are. Including
  ecosystem challenges doesn’t really change the scope of your innovation
  project, it changes the extent to which you include external risk as a piece
  you actively manage. “A narrow lens will leave you focused on execution risk,
  prone to ignore the implications of co-innovators and adoption chain
  partners,” Adner says. Using a wide lens to assess your innovation transforms
  the key strategic choices you make to achieve success.

  ### Hidden Risks


  > "While managers have rich processes in place to assess and manage their own
  execution challenges, they do not fully understand their dependence on their
  partners’ co-innovation challenges."- Wide Lens, page 38


  _Wide Lens_ will help innovators see hidden dependencies which lead to better
  strategies. Key to achieving this is understanding the **Co-innovation Risk**
  and **Adoption Chain Risk** which tend to remain unseen in traditional
  strategy. Co-innovation Risk is “the extent to which the success of your
  innovation depends on the successful commercialization of other innovations”;
  and Adoption Chain Risk is “the extent to which partners will need to adopt
  your innovation” before it ever arrives to customers.


  On your value blueprint you will want to identify the risks throughout the
  ecosystem for each element and ask questions such as “How **able** are they to
  undertake the required activity?” and “How **willing** are they to undertake
  the required activity?”

  ### Value Blueprint


  > "The value blueprint is a map that makes your ecosystem and your
  dependencies explicit. It lays out the arrangement of the elements that are
  required to deliver the value proposition—how the activities are positioned,
  how they are linked, and which actor is responsible for what."- Wide Lens,
  page 84


  Traditional project planning would utilize a supply chain model and a very
  linear sequencing of events and producers along the way. However innovation
  requires fully mapping out your ecosystem and assessing for each segment or
  partner the two types of risk associated with innovation ecosystems:
  Co-innovation Risk and Adoption Risk.


  To map out your value blueprint, you’ll identify who the final target of your
  innovation is—your end customer. Identify what your own project is that you’ll
  deliver. Identify each supplier for the inputs into your project. Also
  identify every partner who would touch your product or pass it on before _or
  after_ it arrives to your customer. These won’t necessarily be in a sequential
  order, so it’s also important to identify _when_ each partner is involved.
  “Huge allocations of resources and deep wells of talent on their own cannot
  make up for red lights on the path to success,” writes Adner. “If your value
  proposition requires multiple parties to collaborate, building a deep
  understanding of the structure of collaboration is critical.”
f_conclusion: >-
  _Wide Lens_ includes these and other valuable tools to enable your decisions
  to be more informed ones. In some cases the better decision will be to simply
  pass and devote resources to another idea that has a greater chance of
  success. In either case, you will expand your perspective to identify risks
  that might have been overlooked completely or examined after it was too late.
  No matter what, after reading _Wide Lens_ you’ll never look at innovation,
  project planning, or your likelihood for success in the same way again.

In _Wide Lens_, Ron Adner provides a new methodology and set of tools with which to plan innovative projects. You will see the blueprint for success more clearly, using a wider lens. This new view doesn’t eliminate obstacles or dependencies; it merely lets you see them while there’s still time to do something about it. You will then be able to more accurately assess the risk and chart the course for your projects accordingly.

“This book is about seeing interaction between your own execution risk and the risks that are introduced by your ecosystem partners,” explains Adner. “It is about how to revisit your strategy to proactively manage these interactions and, in this way, drive better outcomes.” You will find examples of excellent execution of truly innovative products that were first to market, yet doomed to failure. It’s only upon examining them with a wide lens that the causes are readily evident. Had these companies looked at all the pieces that relied on external partners and assessed their risk, they could have identified and planned how to solve these problems before it was too late.

As Adner explains, “it is no longer enough to manage your innovation. Now you must manage your innovation system.” _Wide Lens_ is the perfect toolkit for learning how to do that.
