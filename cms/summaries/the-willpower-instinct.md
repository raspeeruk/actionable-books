  ### Meditate to enhance self-control


  > "If there is a secret to greater self-control, the science points to one
  thing: the power of paying attention. It’s training the mind to recognize when
  you are making a choice, rather than running on autopilot. It’s noticing how
  you give yourself permission to procrastinate, or how you use good behavior to
  justify self-indulgence."- The Willpower Instinct, page 237


  “How can you control yourself if you aren’t even aware that there is something
  to control?” Before we can take charge of our determination, we need to
  recognize when we’re making a choice requiring willpower.


  One of the most effective ways to boost self-awareness is through meditation.
  McGonigal points to a study demonstrating improved self-control after only
  three hours of meditating. Meditation boosts willpower because it trains the
  brain to pause before acting. This pause or break helps boost our
  attentiveness as we make decisions throughout the day. “It’s the habit of
  noticing what you are about to do, and choosing to do the more difficult thing
  instead of the easiest.”


  Once you’ve increased your awareness, watch out for your future self.

  ### Be more compassionate


  > "Giving in makes you feel bad about yourself, which motivates you to do
  something to feel better. And what’s the cheapest, fastest strategy for
  feeling better? Often the very thing you feel bad about."- The Willpower
  Instinct, page 145


  Our brains are programmed to use the promise of reward to alleviate feeling
  bad. Why does stress lead to cravings? It stems from the brain’s fight or
  flight response and its inclination to protect our body and mind. Stress
  alters our brain into a reward-seeking condition. We end up “craving whatever
  substance or activity that our brain associates with a promise of reward.”


  How do we avoid this? When faced with stress and failure, increase
  self-compassion to boost motivation and self-control. Realize that setbacks
  are part of being human and don’t use it as an excuse to indulge further.


  Forgiveness (and not guilt) increases accountability, giving a boost to our
  self-control. “Researchers have found that taking a self-compassionate point
  of view on a personal failure makes people more likely to take personal
  responsibility for their failure than when they take a self-critical point of
  view.”


  Use effective stress relief strategies, such as exercise and meditation, to
  feel better. These stress relievers “boost mood-enhancing brain chemicals like
  serotonin,” and help reduce the stress response.

  ### Don’t over-commit your future self


  > "We think about our future selves like different people. We often idealize
  them, expecting our future selves to do what our present selves cannot
  manage."- The Willpower Instinct, page 172


  The author makes the distinction between our present and future selves. Since
  the brain has a tendency to take the path of least resistance, the **Present
  Self** is interested in immediate gratification. **Future Self** has more
  time, energy, and motivation than present self and always has your long-term
  interests in mind. But the problem is that when the future arrives, we keep
  postponing it to our future selves again.


  “We put off what we need to do because we are waiting for someone else to show
  up who will find the change effortless.” We tell ourselves that we’ll skip our
  workouts today but will go tomorrow when we’ll have more energy. The reason we
  defer the tough choices to our future selves rather than act on our
  commitments is because our future selves don’t feel as real and pressing as
  our present self.


  One of her recommendations to alleviate this is to “make choices in advance
  and from a clear distance, before your future self is blinded by temptation.”
  Basically, make it easier for your future self to act on your rational
  preferences and more difficult for your present self to give in to your
  immediate gratification.


  An example would be to pre-commit or schedule and prepay for personal training
  sessions in advance. Eliminate temptations, such as bringing credit cards in
  your wallet when you’re out shopping and only bring a predetermined amount of
  cash you plan on spending. Find a way to make immediate gratification
  inconvenient and difficult.


  An additional strategy is to use visualization and imagine your future self in
  lively detail, enjoying the benefits of the choices or commitments you want to
  make. One of the studies she refers to involved non-exercisers imagining a
  healthier future version of themselves. Two months later, the people who
  visualized were more frequent exercisers compared to the non-visualizers.


  “The more real and vivid the future feels, the more likely you are to make a
  decision that your future self won’t regret.”
f_conclusion: >-
  The exercises and thought-provoking questions posed throughout this book are
  well worth the price. Take time to reflect on your choices to gain a better
  understanding of your self-control. Pay attention to how you handle willpower
  failures. After all, “The motivations we understand are always easier to
  change than the influences we cannot see.”

  "We are born to be tempted, and born to resist. Self-control is a matter of
  understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing
  who we are."

> "We are born to be tempted, and born to resist. Self-control is a matter of understanding these different parts of ourselves, not fundamentally changing who we are." _\- The Willpower Instinct, page 237_

A conflict between two competing goals is the ultimate willpower challenge. We make countless decisions and trade-offs every day between immediate gratification and the pursuit of long-term goals.

Kelly McGonigal’s _The Willpower Instinct: How Self-Control Works_ provides a solid look at self-discipline and ways to enhance it when we need it the most. Her book is based on a ten-week course that the award-winning psychology instructor teaches at Stanford. She includes simple exercises that the reader can do to gain insight on specific situations or circumstances that could derail willpower. She believes “the best way to improve self-control is to understand how you lose control.”

The first step to understanding the inner workings of willpower is boosting our attentiveness and mindfulness.
