  ### Make Each Day Your Masterpiece


  > "You cannot change yesterday, and a better tomorrow will be the result of
  what you do today. If you do your best, angels can do no better. And this
  present moment – right now – is when you have that opportunity."- The Wisdom
  of Wooden, page 8


  Make Each Day Your Masterpiece.  

  Read the previous sentence again: _Make._ **_Each_** _Day. Your_
  **_Masterpiece!_**


  If there’s one piece of advice Coach wanted us to learn and apply fully, it
  was this: Imagine not only the possibilities, but progress and experience you
  would have if each day was _truly_ your masterpiece.


  _“Thus, if I may offer you one piece of advice that I hope you’ll apply after
  reading our book, it is this suggestion from my father: ‘Make_ each _day your
  masterpiece.’ When you do that as the weeks and months and years (and, for me,
  century) unfold behind you, you’ll have the deepest self-satisfaction knowing
  your life has really meant something.”_

  ### Redefine Success


  > "Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in
  knowing you made the effort to become the best you are capable of becoming."-
  The Wisdom of Wooden, page 54


  As a high school English teacher and basketball coach, Coach didn’t agree with
  the traditional definition of success everyone had at the time; the belief
  that success should be strictly measured by outcome. He believed it was
  _“_grossly invalid and unfair” to judge success by the number of victories a
  team had or the number of A’s a student had.


  Coach believed success was about much more than just the end result.  

  More than another “A”.  

  More than another win.  

  And more than another trophy.


  That’s not to say Coach didn’t care about winning and losing. He did.  

  He just felt there was _something_ more important than winning and losing.


  _“I want to be clear about something: Winning or losing matters. Why else
  would we keep score? When you win it usually feels good. Losing hurts, and it
  should. But my belief is that winning and losing are a by-product, offshoot,
  consequence of something more important. That’s why in my early years of
  teaching, I sought to figure out what that ‘something’ was.”_


  So in 1932, he created his own definition of success.  

  A definition which he shared in his [memorable TEDTalk in
  2001](http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/john_wooden_on_the_difference_between_winning_and_success.html).  

  A definition he felt was _“_a more realistic and honest appraisal of success”:


  _“My definition of success, my concept of what constitutes ‘greatness’ in an
  individual or a team and how to achieve those lofty goals, is put in
  perspective with a simple directive: Do not judge yourself by what you have
  achieved but rather by what you could and should have achieved given your
  potential – if you’d never ceased trying to be the best you could be.”_


  It’s an interesting dichotomy to think of a coach best known for “winning” as
  defining success by effort. Perhaps an explanation lies in the quantifiable
  success you naturally have when you put the emphasis on effort – on something
  you have complete control over. It’s sort of like the business person who
  focuses on work they love and make great money as a result, versus the person
  who works strictly for the money.


  **Do you define success by mastering that which you have control over, or by
  outside recognition beyond your control?**
f_conclusion: >-
  _The Wisdom of Wooden_ isn’t your typical leadership or business book – in
  fact, it _isn’t_ a business book. It’s a collection of stories, philosophies,
  teachings, poems and pictures that have been at the heart of Coach John
  Wooden’s life; a life which happens to be one of the greatest legacies of the
  20th century.
f_quote-2: >-
  "At some point Sports Illustrated concluded: 'There has never been a finer
  coach in American sports. Nor a finer man.' It's the last part – ‘nor a finer
  man’ – that makes John Wooden JOHN WOODEN."
