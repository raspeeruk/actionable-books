  ### A culture of impact stems from values and behaviors


  > "(XYZ Factor) is an environment created by behaviors and values, not a
  policy manual approved by external lawyers or board members. It indicates the
  successful coming together of three generations to produce boldly and
  efficiently."- The XYZ Factor, page xi


  DoSomething.org is a very mission-driven organization with a dedication to
  making an impact. Since their mission is to mobilize young people under 25, it
  seems only natural that their organizational culture would be an extension of
  this youthfulness. The reason why it works is because their focus on their
  values and behaviors to create this culture, not some prescribed notion of
  what the organization ‘should’ be like.


  They identify 7 key factors that make the XYZ so functional and special:


  1.  **Value choice** – Millennials grew up with lots of choice and now it is
  expected, so companies need to offer choices to their employees.

  2.  **Move fast** – There’s nothing worse than being caught in an
  organizational approval process, especially if it takes longer than a day.
  Figure out where there are bottlenecks and improve the efficiency of the
  process.

  3.  **Nomadic** – Job hopping is the new norm for most people under 35, but
  it’s not just jobs that Millennials change. They change up many aspects of
  their lives on a regular basis. It is important that XYZ managers recognize
  that their employees may be experiencing flux in their personal lives.

  4.  **Measurable feedback** – The typical performance review will not cut it
  in an XYZ company. There needs to be a process for regular feedback. This
  doesn’t mean just positive feedback. Constructive feedback is just as (if not
  more) helpful.

  5.  **Do overs** – Millennials grew up with the option of do overs, and for
  many it has led to being afraid of failure. XYZ companies create an
  environment where people can ask questions and take educated risks.

  6.  **Wired** – Millennials are an incredibly wired generation and constantly
  keeping in contact with people. XYZ companies need to offer employees
  technology that reflect the times, not by-gone corporate culture.

  7.  **Everything is public** – Social media has transformed our lives, for
  better or worse. Overlap that with technology, and you’ll see the important
  role of transparency in the office. Open calendars, Google Docs and so on
  represent the new way of office collaboration.

  ### Data is absolutely necessary


  > "Your organization has a similar kind of nervous system: a nearly real-time
  feedback loop that can inform the efficacy of programs, products and services.
  Unfortunately, most companies don’t tap into this."- The XYZ Factor, page 64


  There is lots of talk about the importance of data to a modern organization,
  yet many organizations are still struggling to harness the power of their
  data. Organizations may be collecting data but aren’t empowered to react to
  it, or they may not be collecting it at all. For DoSomething.org, there are
  many levels of data and how that data can influence their decision making. For
  instance they have over 3 million members who they communicate with regularly
  and who take action through DoSomething.org initiatives. They have identified
  their members as central to their data-driven decision making, and have taken
  the time to identify what ‘impact’ looks like for their organization. They
  suggest 3 characteristics of a data-informed organization.


  1.  **Empathy** – Understanding what success looks like, and then using data
  to solve problems.

  2.  **Focus** – Be able to distinguish between data and metrics and create
  KPIs.

  3.  **Speed** – The speed of your insights must match the speed of your
  decision making.

  ### Embrace the whole person


  > "At DoSomething.org, we let our coworkers in on our lives outside of work,
  and this is one of the most significant components of an XYZ organization."-
  The XYZ Factor, page 11


  For years part of corporate culture has meant being buttoned up and
  professional in the workplace. Sharing (let alone over-sharing) about your
  personal life was often frowned upon. But DoSomething.org has found that by
  embracing and welcoming the whole person, not just the professional, they are
  able to cultivate much better work relationships. This means things like
  connecting with each other on social media platforms and showing off their
  individuality. They reference CEO Nancy Lublin’s obsession with Hello Kitty
  and how she has lots of Hello Kitty paraphernalia on display in her office. By
  having the CEO lead by example, all staff feel welcome and encouraged to be
  themselves in the workplace to create a more authentic experience.

  _The XYZ Factor_ is packed with so many insights from an incredibly innovative
  organization. It was hard to pick just two Insights as there are so many
  sprinkled in the pages of this book. There are numerous books on HR and
  organizational culture, but _The XYZ Factor_ is a handbook for the 21st
  Century.

DoSomething.org is something of a marvel in the non-profit sector. They have managed to mobilize millions of young people about issues that matter to them all while making doing good look easy and fun. Their modern approach to achieving massive success represents the essence of what many non-profits are striving to achieve – digital savviness, community engagement, killer branding, and mobilizing Millennials. But what is most remarkable about DoSomething.org is their organizational culture and how it has become a model for all companies seeking inter-generational harmony.

In _The XYZ Factor_ DoSomething.org staff give a behind-the-scenes look at how the organization operates and what makes it so desirable. They wrote _The XYZ Factor_ as a blueprint that other companies can draw on to improve organizational culture. The key to it all? The XYZ factor is all about adopting the principles of the Millennial generation to foster productivity in a new kind of office culture. What is most refreshing about DoSomething.org is their new (and positive) perspective on the Millennial generation workforce, which has the power to encourage other companies to reconsider how they view and work with Millennials.
