  ### Opportunity Can Be Manufactured


  > "…this is the core of entrepreneurship – being the person who makes
  something happen for yourself."- Things a Little Bird Told Me, page 11


  Prior to working at Google, Stone had never applied for a “real job” before.
  He had always been an entrepreneur, working on self-directed projects. He
  attributes this gumption to his childhood experiences with creative projects.
  He tells the story about a family friend who was an electrician and how he
  considered his basement to be a laboratory. He dreamed up all sorts of
  interesting things to build and create during this time. This carried over
  into his adult life as he continues to dream up things to create using
  technology.


  He suggests that a useful exercise with any problem or idea is to visualize
  what you want to see happen for yourself over the next two years. “The goal
  isn’t to solve anything. If you take an idea and just hold it in your head,
  you unconsciously start to do things that advance you toward that goal.” Stone
  is not the first person to suggest the powers of visualization in goal
  setting, but I do like his take on it – that the practice is what helps you to
  manufacture your own opportunities. In essence it builds confidence.
  Furthermore, this confidence helps you seize opportunities or create your own
  so that you can achieve what you desire.

  ### Share Failure


  > "In fact, \[failure\] was a critical component of growth. By sharing it with
  our users, we were showing our ultimate confidence in ourselves and our
  success. We weren’t quitting, and we hoped our faith would inspire others."-
  Things a Little Bird Told Me, page 97


  Anyone who used Twitter in the early days probably has memories of the Twitter
  fail whale – an ominous graphic and error message that seemed to appear
  anytime you had something clever to say. This was a significant problem with
  the Twitter platform. They were especially motivated to make it more stable
  leading up to the 2008 presidential election. For the Twitter team, Stone
  shared, it was a particular point of pride and passion when they realized the
  influence and the possible role that Twitter could play in a large societal
  conversation. Luckily, Twitter exceeded and sustained its normal capacity on
  that historic night.


  While the error messages and fail whale were annoying for users, many people
  during that time rallied around the Twitter team to encourage their work.
  Stone says that this played a significant role in their ability to push
  forward and innovate. In many ways, I think this story is an example of the
  power of authenticity and transparency. It’s not something we see often in the
  corporate setting. But when a company models this for their community they
  foster even more loyalty.

  ### Limits Make You More Creative


  > "Think about the question ‘How was your day?’ The answer is almost always
  ‘Fine.’ But putting constraints on the question – ‘How was your lunch with
  Steve’ – yields a much more interesting answer."- Things a Little Bird Told
  Me, page 56


  I first came across the idea of limitations being a good thing in Todd Henry’s
  [_The Accidental
  Creative_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-accidental-creative/) and
  I thought it was interesting that this idea is reaffirmed by Stone. He gives
  numerous examples of how limitations have inspired memorable creativity. For
  instance, “When Harrison Ford was shooting _Raiders of the Lost Ark_, three
  months of filming in Tunisia gave the actor a terrible case of the runs. When
  it came time to shoot a long, drawn-out sword battle, Ford desperate to call
  it a day, suggested he simply pull out his pistol and shoot the guy. This
  improvised solution became one of the movie’s best, funniest and most iconic
  scenes.”


  Stone goes on to say that the concept of limitations or constraints is what
  led to the infamous 140 characters of a Tweet. It was meant to be a creative
  challenge to Twitter users in their acts of self expression. He encourages
  readers to think about what limits they can places on themselves or their
  projects to increase creativity.
f_conclusion: >-
  Stone’s story of persistence, creativity and innovation is inspiring. But I
  was most inspired by his nature and humanity. He sees that there is more to
  life than just the day to day and the projects we work on – that there is a
  bigger, brighter possibility to change the world for the better.

> "The true promise of a connected society is enabling our dormant potential for empathy." _\- Things a Little Bird Told Me, page xv_

Biz Stone has one of the most interesting and eclectic backgrounds in the startup community. He is behind many tech startups including Xanga, Blogger, Odeo, Twitter, Medium and Jelly. His book _Things a Little Bird Told Me_ is much more than a personal memoir of war stories from Silicon Valley – though there are quiet a few of those. Stone has been at numerous startups and in this collection of personal stories, he shares insights and learnings about business and life. It is clear that he is on a mission to help people go beyond the day-to-day of their lives to encourage them to lead meaningful, fulfilling lives. More importantly, he wants to show people that anything is possible.

I found the overtures of his stories and message surprisingly refreshing. He has a deep passion for philanthropic causes and doing good in the world. His experiences have yielded a unique perspective on the possibility of technology in the 21st century and what it can mean for the global community.
