  ### Redefine the problem


  > "Whatever problem you’re trying to solve, make sure you’re not just
  attacking the noisy part of the problem that happens to capture your
  attention. Before spending all your time and resources, it’s incredibly
  important to properly define the problem—or, better yet, redefine the
  problem."- Think Like a Freak, page 51-52


  Dubner and Levitt tell us how competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi redefined his
  “problem” and changed competitive hot dog eating. Traditionally, competitive
  hot dog eaters ate bun and dog together like you might at a backyard barbecue.
  Kobayashi found removing the dog from the bun, breaking up the dog, and
  dunking the bun in water helped the parts to slide down more quickly and
  efficiently. He decided to out think his competitors and eat in a way they
  hadn’t considered.


  Kobayashi changed the question from, “How do I eat more hot dogs?” to “How do
  I make hot dogs easier to eat?” and created a new technique. He ignored the
  previous record, which he believed was an artificial barrier. No one had ever
  done it the way he was going to do it, so the existing record had no bearing.
  In his very first hot dog eating competition, Kobayashi doubled the world
  record to 50 hot dogs in 12 minutes.


  While Dubner, Levitt, and Kobayashi have the luxury of few limits in many
  cases, we don’t all get to live without rules, so to speak. Even so, we can
  all learn to redefine our problems and wipe away our barriers, even if it’s
  just for brainstorming purposes to get the problem solving juices flowing.

  ### No one does something for nothing


  > "With any problem, it’s important to figure out which incentives will
  actually work, not just what your moral compass tells you should work. They
  key is to think less about the ideal behavior of imaginary people and more
  about the actual behavior of real people. Those real people are much more
  unpredictable."- Think Like a Freak, page 115


  I work in a business where certain behavior is constantly reinforced by
  contests and incentives. We often assume that our people will respond to
  winning either money or a prize. But maybe we need to rethink our incentives
  and read the actions of our people to see what really drives them. The authors
  cite an experiment about electricity conservation. Psychologist Robert
  Cialdini found that people were more likely to conserve energy because
  placards told them that their neighbors were doing it. In this case, moral,
  social, and financial incentives lost to the herd mentality. “Everyone is
  doing it” was a far greater motivation than saving money, the environment, or
  just doing the right thing.

  ### Start with a stone to move a mountain


  > "To think like a Freak means to think small, not big. Why? For starters,
  every big problem has been thought about endlessly by people much smarter than
  we are. The fact that it remains a problem means it is too damned hard to be
  cracked in full. Such problems are intractable, hopelessly complex, brimming
  with entrenched and misaligned incentives. Sure, there are some truly
  brilliant people out there and they probably should think big. For the rest of
  us, thinking big means you’ll spend a lot of time tilting at windmills."-
  Think Like a Freak, page 89


  In chapter 5, “Think Like a Child”, Levitt and Dubner encourage readers to
  adopt three childlike behaviors: have fun, think small, and don’t fear the
  obvious. Spending time with three year olds reminds us that airplane noises
  make them eat with enthusiasm and children see things that adults look past.
  When children are at play or are being coached to do things, we instruct them
  to focus on one piece at a time—to think small about a task to get from one
  place to another.


  Education reform is often a hot topic and a big dilemma to tackle. In “think
  like a Freak” fashion, Levitt and Dubner point out that the children are often
  overlooked when we are considering changes to education. According to the
  book, one in four children have poor vision and 60% of students that have
  trouble in the classroom also have trouble seeing. So, why not give them
  eyeglasses to see if learning improves? Three economists did just that in
  China and found that test scores went up dramatically for challenged learners
  that were given glasses as compared to the control group without corrective
  lenses. The authors are quick to point out that eyeglasses don’t solve all of
  the educational challenges we have, but this small thinking can make a huge
  dent in changing learning for the better. Here, we’re reminded not to look
  past obvious, simpler, and cheaper solutions.
f_conclusion: >-
  If you haven’t read any of the _Freakanomics_ trilogy, don’t worry. You don’t
  need to read the other books for this to be fun, informative, and
  entertaining. I couldn’t include all the good stuff in this summary. I really
  wanted to tackle the idea of persuading people that don’t want to be persuaded
  but I thought I would leave that up to some of you. How will you persuade the
  strong willed? Channel your inner David Lee Roth? Decide if you should quit?
  Use incentives? Or hey, just in general, how will you start turning problems
  on their heads because you’ve learned to Think Like a Freak? I’d love to hear
  from you in the comments below!

  "Rather than trying and probably failing to answer most of the questions sent
  our way, we wondered if it might be better to write a book that can teach
  anyone to think like a Freak. What might that look like?"

If you’re already a fan of the [_Freakonomics_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/freakonomics) franchise, then _Think Like a Freak_ will delight you with a new twist. Over the course of nine chapters, economist Steven D. Levitt and writer Stephen J. Dubner cover various ways to change how you approach problems to reach new conclusions. The authors use colorful storytelling with data to back them up, including references to M&Ms, the British Prime Minister, wine, and even a chapter called, “What do King Solomon and David Lee Roth have in Common?” The advice from each chapter can be taken separately, but the authors often refer back to stories in earlier chapters to show how using more than one way of disrupting traditional thinking will help you find new solutions.
