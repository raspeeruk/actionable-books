  ### Put Your Passion at the Heart of Your Business


  > "Build what you believe in."- Think Like Zuck, page 33


  Passion must serve as the heart of your business. Everything follows from
  that, Walter asserts, starting with your own understanding of who you are and
  what your purpose is. From there you can craft your ideas, define your
  creations, mold your products, and propel innovation. **“Align your business
  with your personal philosophy,”** she advises.


  For Zuck, Facebook marks the sweet spot where his dual passions for software
  and social connections overlap. From that wellspring flow all the continuous
  innovations in engineering and services that have propelled the company to
  global dominance in social networking.


  Zuckerburg has committed himself to connecting the world, not to getting rich.
  **“We don’t build services to make money; we make money to build better
  services,”** he declared in his IPO letter. Walters finds that this kind of
  passion to “make a ding in the universe” (as Steve Jobs once said)
  characterizes truly great entrepreneurs, naming not only Zuck and Jobs, but
  also Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and a host of others.


  **Your passion will provide the perseverance needed to build a great
  company.**

  ### Get the Right People on Board


  > "Develop smart hiring procedures consistent with your cultural values that
  bring the right people on board."- Think Like Zuck, page 78


  **Your single most vital capital for sustainable success is human capital.**
  If you can get the right people on board—the ones who share your cultural
  values—you will multiply the energy that can be leveraged for innovation.
  Don’t think in in terms of filling slots—get the best talent with the right
  outlook, and then figure out where to put them. **“Hire for attitude,”
  emphasizes Walter. “Skills can be taught; passion can’t.”**


  For Southwest Airlines, that means looking for the “warrior spirit,” not
  airline experience. For the hacker culture that defines Mark Zuckerburg and
  permeates Facebook, employees must share the commitment to improving user
  experience as the product is always being upgraded, and redesigned.
  Experimentation and mistakes are embraced as a necessary part of the process.


  **Talented people don’t need to be managed, they need to be empowered.**
  Creating an environment of trust unleashes creativity and motivation. The
  policy of giving employees freedom to pursue their own ideas, pioneered by 3M,
  has been adopted by other celebrated innovative giants, e.g., Google and
  Apple. Furthermore, the resulting flat management structures facilitate
  collaboration.


  How much does hiring for cultural values matter? About $1.2 billion, if you go
  by what Jeff Bezos of Amazon paid to purchase Zappos, renowned for its unique
  culture committed to delighting customers and employees alike. Estimating $100
  million in losses from wrong hires, Zappos began offering newly trained
  employees $4,000 to quit on the spot.


  A great hire can compensate for weaknesses at the top as well. Zuck wooed
  Sheryl Sandberg of Google to handle the operational side, setting a precedent
  for young founders of tech start-ups to hire a seasoned COO for balance**.
  Success in business is a team sport**, and Walter cites other famous
  complementary partnerships that generated long-term success: the Warner
  brothers in film, the Johnson brothers of Johnson & Johnson, Steve Jobs and
  Steve Wozniak of Apple, and, less well-known, Sears and Roebuck. “Success is a
  team sport,” Walter observes.


  At the end of the day, if you are inspired to create a successful company
  culture and leadership team, you need to know both your strengths, i.e., the
  values and commitment you bring, as well as your weaknesses, i.e., areas where
  you lack expertise or experience.

  ### Passion Fuels Purpose

  Think Like Zuck, page 41


  **A purpose with passion will even trump creativity**, as Walter’s examples
  reveal. You can borrow someone else’s idea and improve on it—but you need your
  own energy resources to push forward despite obstacles, rejections, and
  mistakes.


  Zuck’s first attempt to connect college students via the internet, FaceMash,
  got him in hot water with Harvard officials for unauthorized use of college
  photos. Undaunted, he forged ahead, adapting a user-permission policy in his
  next venture—Facebook.


  He embarked on it with a passionate drive for creating great user experiences.
  That’s the kind of commitment needed to transform an industry and even the
  world. Consider the impact on our lives of such purpose-driven innovations as
  the iPod’s “1000 tunes in your pocket,” Southwest Airline fares, Ford cars,
  Starbucks coffee, Disney cartoons, Zappos’ “wow” customer service, and many
  more.


  **Even as the direction may change, the purpose stays the same in a great
  enterprise.** In 2006, Zuck stunned most observers by turning down Yahoo’s
  purchase offer of one billion dollars. He wanted to stick to his purpose of
  connecting the world.


  Walter invites you to build your passion, whether as an entrepreneur or an
  “intrapraneur”—and provides role models for every step along the way.

  **Can you learn to “think like Zuck” enough to create your entrepreneurial
  success?** Greatness takes passion—and it takes action. Ekaterina Walter
  offers you ample inspiration, challenge, and advice to help you dare to win.

When Mark Zuckerburg founded Facebook in 2004, he was a teenaged Harvard student fascinated by the possibilities of using technology to connect people. In 2012, “Zuck” was still firmly at the helm of Facebook, now valued at over $104 billion with over one billion users.

How did “the new Internet Prince” pull off such an amazing feat—and what lessons can aspiring entrepreneurs learn from his story? Intel social media innovator Ekaterina Walter turns her practiced eye to the Facebook phenomenon and shares her insightful analysis in _Think Like Zuck._ Along the way, she highlights the striking parallels between Zuck and other contemporary entrepreneurial legends, from Apple’s Steve Jobs to Zappos’ Tony Hsieh.

Walter’s advice in a nutshell: **Entrepreneurs who hope to create similar social impact and financial wealth need to integrate five critical elements: purpose, passion, product, people, and partnerships.**
