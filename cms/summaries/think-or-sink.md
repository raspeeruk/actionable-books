  ### The Small Slice of Reality


  > "…we can process about 7 x 18 = 126 bits of information per second. It is
  estimated that there are millions of bits of information available to you in
  any given second."- Think or Sink, page 14


  Have you ever bought a car – a car that you believed was fairly rare – and
  then immediately started to see many more of them on the road than ever
  before? No, a million other people did not buy the car the same day you did.
  Instead, after focusing on the car in great detail for a period of time, you
  effectively trained your mind to notice it. The number of cars of that model
  on the road hasn’t changed, but your perspective and focus has.


  Definitive research has shown that our conscious minds have the limited
  ability of processing 126 bits of information per second. A large role of our
  unconscious mind is to filter the millions of bits of information that we’re
  bombarded by every second and delete, distort and generalize it, allowing us
  to focus on that which we deem important. In the car example above, we’ve
  effectively trained our minds to highlight the model we just bought and
  register it consciously. We change our focus, and suddenly the world around us
  presents us with evidence that supports our new, deliberate train of thought.
  It isn’t cosmic magic, it’s our brain at work.


  It’s actually pretty neat stuff. Whether you can relate to the car example
  above, or can think of another example, you probably know what I’m talking
  about. Our brains are amazing devices that present us with the data we choose
  to focus on. The point is that your brain likes making sense of the world;
  you’ll typically find supporting details for your beliefs. So shift your
  beliefs.

  ### Reality (Big ‘R’)


  > "The key to maintaining your power is to remain present to what is actually
  happening instead of giving in to the meaning created in your internal
  representation."- Think or Sink, page 152


  So your brain is only processing 126 bits a second out of the millions of bits
  available. If you can embrace this fact, one of the first realizations is that
  your “reality” (little ‘r’) is only a small fraction of true Reality (big
  ‘R’). This is why two people can watch the exact same event and have two
  totally different interpretations of what happened.


  We take in the millions of bits of Reality (big ‘R’) through our five senses.
  Our reality (little ‘r’) is the culmination of 126 of those bits, combined
  with our own internal voice. That voice is based on past experiences and
  expectation. Can you start to see how skewed your version of reality can be
  from the real thing? Those who believe their reality to be absolute (i.e. the
  only way of seeing the world), can often be frustrated, disappointed and
  confused by the outcomes they experience. When the outcome of your actions is
  wildly different from what you expected (heck, even if it is a _little_
  different), you have to choose whether you stubbornly resist the truth, or
  accept it as feedback. Those who resist will continue the cycle anew – holding
  firm to their skewed beliefs and expecting different results. Success goes to
  those who humbly learn from their experiences; to those who use their results
  as feedback, showing them the variance between their internal voice’s
  interpretation of Reality and the reality they’d like to experience. All of
  this is to say that there are virtually an infinite number of ways to
  interpret a result and that “failure” is simply an opportunity to adjust our
  focus and understanding so that we might take in more of the bits of
  information that support our ideal outcome in the future.

  ### Problem Solving Flaws


  > "There is a huge difference between problem-focused thinking and
  solution-focused thinking."- Think or Sink, page 144


  _The Secret_ says, “Whatever you focus on, expands.” The misinterpretation is
  that whatever you focus on will be manifested in the world around you. No
  wonder a lot of people find that hard to swallow. The truth is that whatever
  you focus on will be brought to your conscious awareness.


  Think about your biggest challenge in life right now. If you spend your time
  thinking about the problem, your unconscious brain will filter all the million
  bits of information being thrown at you each second and present you with more
  evidence to support the problem. Your brain likes being right. Which doesn’t
  really help you solve the problem, does it? Try shifting your focus from the
  problem to the solution. What is it you really want to accomplish? This isn’t
  blind optimism, and it’s not a suggestion that you gloss over the problem.
  Instead, it’s a reminder that the problem shouldn’t be your biggest focus –
  the solution should be. Focus on the ideal solution long enough, and your
  brain will shift gears. It will start providing evidence – evidence that was
  already around you, but not consciously recognized – that you can then use to
  work towards the solution (and by definition, around or through the problem).


  Professional athletes do this all the time. They focus on the ideal outcome,
  and visualize, as vividly as possible, all the steps necessary to actualize
  it. Focus on “not falling”, and your brain gets caught up in the “falling”
  portion of the process. Focus instead on greatness. If it works for Olympic
  athletes (and it has, for years), it’s certainly worth trying in your own
  life.
f_conclusion: >-
  Mollicone-Long’s book _Think or Sink_ is a really neat read. It gives us great
  insight into the workings of the human brain, and teaches us how we can
  systematically train it to support and create the outcomes we desire. Anyone
  who’s read or watched _The Secret_ should make this required reading. For me,
  it cements and grounds the ideas from the hugely successful franchise and
  teaches us how we can actually apply the concepts to our lives.

Assuming you haven’t been hiding under a rock for the last decade, you’ve probably heard of the uber-successful franchise _The Secret_. One of the largest criticisms of the book/movie is its (apparently) highly controversial thesis that you can manifest anything in life simply by visualizing it. This over simplification of the concept misses the point. In her new best seller _Think or Sink_, Gina Mollicone-Long dives deeper into the issue and teaches us the science behind _The Secret_.

Visualization is only one half of the story. It’s an important half, and one that should not be written off or belittled, but there is a crucial foundation that is glossed over. Today we will fill you in on the “back story” and explain how the secret of _The Secret_ can be harnessed in your life.
