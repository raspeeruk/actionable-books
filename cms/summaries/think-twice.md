  ### Try to Lose


  > "Here’s a simple test of whether an activity involves skill: ask if you can
  lose on purpose. Think about casino games like roulette or slots. Winning or
  losing is purely a matter of luck. It doesn’t matter what you do. But if you
  can lose on purpose, then skill is involved."- Think Twice, page 132


  Some things we might like to think we are responsible for such as success at
  work or profitable investments are mostly luck. They are too complex for us to
  control all the aspects or predict all the outcomes. Reasons they succeed or
  fail are not in our control. Mauboussin points out when something good happens
  we usually attribute it to our skills. When something bad happens, we often
  blame luck. Our error is making the judgment based on the outcome. Instead, we
  need to focus on the process. The process is what caused the result. Effective
  decisions come from focusing on processes we control not trying to control
  what happens by chance.


  If you cannot lose on purpose, your decision is not directly responsible for
  the outcome. If you can, then you need to evaluate whether or not you have the
  skill necessary to achieve your desired result.


  If your decision involves skill, building skills takes focused time and
  deliberate practice. Mauboussin says most experts do not come close to
  satisfying the requirements for deliberate practice and cautions us against
  overconfidence. Honest introspection is important as well as openness to
  high-quality feedback to expand our perspective—both are essential in building
  skills. Keep your decisions in line with your degree of skill.

  ### Examine the Past


  > "If you are serious about improving your decisions and are open to feedback,
  there is a simple, inexpensive technique of great value – a decision-making
  journal. Whenever you make an important decision, take a moment to write down
  what you decided, how you came to that decision, and what you expect to
  happen. If you have the time and the inclination, you can also note how you
  feel physically and mentally."- Think Twice, page 141


  Journaling enables us to audit our decisions. The more information we record
  about our decision, the more useful it will be later on. We have a tendency to
  evaluate results of past decisions and think we knew more than we did. We also
  might make spurious connections and think there is a correlation between
  unrelated events. Keeping a record that we can examine helps us develop a less
  biased perspective. It also might identify useful patterns in good and bad
  outcomes. Honesty and open-mindedness are essential. After all, we want to
  find our mistakes to improve future decisions.


  If you are already in the habit of journaling, you have information that can
  help you now. I keep a journal and I was able to look back at the decisions I
  made three years ago and compare them to similar decisions I am making now. If
  I had designated the journal as a decision-making journal and kept concise
  notes, it would be more useful. Although it is incomplete, the information I
  recorded has given me some important insights.

  ### Imagine the Future


  > "But Gary Klein, a psychologist, suggests what he calls a premortem, a
  process that occurs before a decision is made. You assume you are in the
  future and the decision you made has failed. You then provide plausible
  reasons for that failure. In effect, you try to identify why your decision
  might lead to a poor outcome before you make the decision."- Think Twice, page
  142


  Most of our daily decisions have clear consequences for our actions. Decisions
  like not paying our electric bill would cause our electricity to be
  disconnected. Complex decisions may not have obvious consequences. It is
  useful to imagine a worst-case scenario. For example, perhaps you are planning
  to move. Imagine the move went badly; now list all the reasons why. You can
  identify possible problems before they happen and take proactive measures.
  (Maybe you forgot to have the electricity turned on before the move.)
f_conclusion: >-
  It can be difficult to make good decisions especially if you are aware you
  lack sufficient skill in an unfamiliar area. Friends and family often offer
  quick advice that makes them feel helpful and allays their fears. It might be
  well meant but it is not qualified and it supports their bias. Often they do
  not suffer the consequences if their advice is faulty. Experts are hard to
  trust because their qualifications can be difficult to verify and their
  expertise is assumed. Sometimes they are rewarded if they persuade you to make
  a decision that is not in your best interest. It might be hard to determine if
  their recommendations fit your situation. If they have a panacea, it is
  certainly bad advice. This is why we need to have these mental tools to help
  us navigate to the best possible outcome.
f_quote-2: >-
  "You needn’t think twice before every decision. Since most decisions will be
  straightforward, with clear-cut repercussions, the mistakes in this book will
  not be relevant. We all make lots of decisions every day, and the stakes are
  generally low. Even when they are not low, the best course is often obvious
  enough. Think Twice’s value comes in situations where the stakes are
  sufficiently high and where your natural decision-making process leads you to
  a suboptimal choice."

Have you ever wondered why smart people make bad decisions with formidable consequences? In _Think Twice_, Michael J. Mauboussin teaches us to make better decisions when it matters most. I liked the polysemous cover. From a distance, the white letters appear to read _Thin Ice,_ but a closer look reveals the dark blue letters in the center completing the words _Think Twice_. It alludes to the book’s subject: making rational decisions when the situation includes risk and ambiguity. When the stakes are high, we have a tendency to rely on emotion, first reactions, false beliefs and misleading advice.

The core of Mauboussin’s methods is developing mental flexibility, introspection and the ability to evaluate evidence effectively. He teaches us about eight concepts that we can learn to help us recognize errors in our own decisions and the decisions of others. Once we recognize the mistakes, we can see how the routines we use to simplify everyday decisions do not work well when we make complex decisions. The goal is to apply what we have learned and create a new set of useful mental tools to make better decisions when it matters most. It enables us to reconsider an automatic response at a crucial time, Think Twice and make a rational choice. He says his personal goal is to identify when he is in a danger zone and slow down and identify the right perspective before making the decision.

I envisioned some of his ideas as virtual time travel. Take a trip with me and explore your decision destination. To prepare, we will evaluate how much we control the outcome. We want to have goals we can reach. Success in reaching our desired destination depends on whether or not our trip requires navigation skill. We do not need to put effort into navigating decisions that are mostly luck. We do not determine the destination of those trips.

This book does not offer a precise formula for guarding against bad decisions. Instead, it teaches us how to think more rationally and identify our opportunities. Not all decisions will have a positive outcome, but over time the most rational thinkers come out ahead.
