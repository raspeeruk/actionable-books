  ### Taking the Bold Path


  > "The Bold Path, is by definition, abnormal. All of us find ourselves on the
  predictable path of how things have been, how things are, and how they will
  be."- Think Wrong, page 36


  Physiology (our brain and the way it is wired) and our culture (our beliefs
  and worldviews) are both the culprits of this status quo. To keep from
  conforming to the norm (the predictable path), we will need to be able to
  deflect from the status quo and protect ourselves from the biological and
  cultural forces trying to pull us back in. We have to Think Wrong in order to
  follow the Bold Path.

  Business schools and training programs perpetuate outmoded thinking through
  the language, frameworks, tools, and techniques they teach. They focus on best
  practices, optimization, ROI, and metrics. They become the standards by which
  we are expected to measure pretty much everything. When we know the problem
  and are certain of the solution, the Think Right Practices are incredibly
  valuable. When we don’t know how well we understand the problem and how
  certain we are about the solution, when we navigate in the uncertain and the
  unknown, the Think Wrong approach is the right practice to use.

  The authors have identified important moments when the flame of possibility
  gets extinguished and have developed six Think Wrong Practices—Be Bold, Get
  Out, Let Go, Make Stuff, Bet Small, and Move Fast—that simultaneously advance
  compelling solutions while defending them from attacks by well-meaning Right
  Thinkers.


  These practices can be used individually or in combination at critical moments
  in the discovery and development process. They will help us to stay on the
  Bold Path and keep from slipping back into the status quo. We dive into two of
  them below.

  ### Move Fast


  > "Move Fast is all about becoming friends with the unknown in order to test a
  host of possibilities quickly and to expedite results that matter. It
  represents a bias to action over dissection of direction."- Think Wrong, page
  199


  We can hear design students or engineers saying the their project’s goal is to
  raise awareness. We should not merely raise awareness but also make something
  that actually works and do it in the field. We should be challenged to go
  deeper into a problem, and the best way to do that is to make as many things
  as quickly as possible and see what happens.


  Failure is part of the learning curve. It takes people time to get comfortable
  with that. Usually people don’t just want to get to the end; they want every
  step to be correct. But we have overcome this notion out and understand that
  the more steps we take, and the more mistakes we learn from, the more likely
  we are to achieve a successful end. Move Fast accelerates the learning process
  so we can push our difference-making solutions out into the world.

  ### Be Bold


  > "There is rarely a ‘Dream’ moment in the world of right thinking. Thinking
  right about a challenge or an opportunity means doing what you are told,
  focusing on the bottom line at the expense of game-changing solutions, and
  going along to get along."- Think Wrong, page 80


  The practice of Be Bold supports the pivotal “Dream” moment. This is a crucial
  time, yet too often we brush right through it in our rush to finish. We’re
  trapped in top-down hierarchies and command-and-control cultures that tell us
  not to ask too many questions. The path to a genius solution starts with
  discovering our true challenge. [Be Bold
  Drills](http://www.thinkwrongbook.com/free-resources) get us questioning the
  way things are and prime us for how things could ideally be. Be Bold helps us
  frame the challenge or opportunity we want to address and define the
  difference we hope to make.


  Bold ideas scare people. They can also feel like a distraction from getting
  things done and go against a culture in which questions are not valued. We
  worry that our vision won’t find support in our organization. Be Bold Drills
  (like “Challenge the Challenge,” for example) upset these dynamics by creating
  playful, respectful, and productive environments within which our teams can
  aspire to achieve more. Let’s have a look at the example below.


  In 2000, entrepreneur David Bastone was shocked to learn that his favorite
  restaurant in the San Francisco Bay Area had served as a hub for human
  trafficking. He then studied the forces behind trafficking for five years and
  wrote a book about it ([_Not for Sale_](https://www.notforsalecampaign.org/)).
  One of the areas he studied is the rainforest in the Peruvian Amazon, where
  both the people and the environment are exploited by human traffickers.


  The bold question and challenge here was: “How might we use social enterprise
  to help disrupt the exploitation of villagers and their environment in this
  region of the Peruvian Amazon?” Traditional answers might include stricter
  governmental regulation, more think tanks on the subject or international
  conferences aimed at incremental changes over enforcement. They took a
  different approach. They gathered a group of diverse individuals—doctors,
  scientists, lawyers, agronomists, healthcare entrepreneurs—and encouraged them
  to think about it as an entrepreneurial opportunity rather than a trafficking
  problem.


  One participant noted the health benefits of Cat’s Claw, which is prevalent in
  this area. Another thought about using this to make tea. They spent the next
  hours envisioning a beverage company and that idea ultimately became [REBBL
  Tonic](http://rebbl.co/). People from seven villages in the Madre de Dios
  region now have greater economic security through contracts with fair trade
  and organic exporters to provide Cat’s Claw and other ingredients, and
  millions of consumers are able to participate in eradicating human trafficking
  by buying a drink. This bold idea never could have happened without first
  overcoming the reaction most people have about fighting human trafficking:
  It’s too big, too dark, too complex an issue. The only way Not For Sale
  arrived at this ingenious solution was by being bold enough to think wrong
  about how we might fight slavery in the modern age.
f_conclusion: >-
  The founding members of the Think Wrong Club featured in this book have two
  things in common. First, they are deeply driven to make a difference. They
  cannot help but see things both as they are and as they should be. Second,
  they share a frustration with how difficult and slow it is to create the
  change they envision. Thinking right already has its language, tools, best
  practices, defenses and case studies. Wrong thinkers need their own language,
  frameworks, tools and techniques to counter the existing norms. The authors
  hope we will adopt the Think Wrong Practices to dream, seek, imagine, build,
  learn, and share in order to change not just how we work, but the way we live.

  "All over the world, people just like you believe there is a nobler, better
  way to work, live and bring novel and life-altering solutions, services,
  products, experiences, policies, processes, and businesses into the world, but
  they are continually derailed by the pervasive power of the status quo."

> "All over the world, people just like you believe there is a nobler, better way to work, live and bring novel and life-altering solutions, services, products, experiences, policies, processes, and businesses into the world, but they are continually derailed by the pervasive power of the status quo." _\- Think Wrong, page 22_

In _Think Wrong: How to Conquer the Status Quo and Do Work That Matters,_ John Bielenberg, Mike Burn, and Greg Galle, designers and innovators, show us how to challenge the status quo and build a culture of problem solving for both small problems and big challenges alike. They believe the way we solve problems is broken. The methods and assumptions we use are outdated as we tend to return to familiar well-trodden paths.

The people we call pioneers and innovators are not necessarily geniuses, but they all have the capacity to “Think Wrong” and approach problems and challenges from a different perspective—think of Galileo asserting that the sun, and not the earth, was the center of the Universe; or the Wright Brothers, who were convinced a man could pilot a flying machine.

This book provides us with new tools to drive change and solve the most complex challenges we are now facing and create the best possible future.
