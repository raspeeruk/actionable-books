  ### Don't do things that suck!


  > "If you are serious about succeeding…you’ve got to get your emotions on your
  side."- This Year I Will, page 28


  More pleasure, less pain. We want easy and there is no shame in that! Our
  minds are pre-wired for fun. Anything that gets in the way of our fun will be
  destroyed; it’s just how we work. Ryan explains that there are three very
  powerful components of our brain that play a vital role in the level of
  success that we are able to achieve. These ‘three brains’, as the author
  refers to them, must work in unison in order for you to achieve your goals.
  The first brain (cerebellum and brain stem) repeats behaviors over and over
  with the goal of preserving our life at all costs. The second brain (limbic
  system) is the emotional brain, which propels us toward pleasure and away from
  pain. If the emotional brain is not on board with your desire to change, it
  will sabotage your efforts in favor of immediate pleasure or perceived safety.
  The third brain (neocortex) is the part of our brain capable of reasoning. The
  emotional brain will override all reason and logic if your brain associates
  pain, no fun, or fear to the desired change. **The more you can find what’s
  fun and enjoyable about what you want, the more your emotional brain will
  cooperate.**

  ### What's at your core?


  > "The emotional and spiritual payoffs for your inner mining are enormous."-
  This Year I Will, page 158


  You are committed. You repeat a motivating mantra to yourself every morning;
  “I am smart enough. I can start my own business and I will do it because I
  really want to.” You’ve even gone so far as to create a list of SMART goals
  that paint the picture of your future self as you see it in your mind. Yet,
  for some reason you haven’t done what you said you would do. According to
  Ryan, you are probably more committed to something else that you are not
  consciously aware of that prevents you from creating forward momentum. Maybe
  you are more afraid of failing then you are committed to starting your new
  business. Under that commitment to avoid failure is a core assumption, a
  belief you formed very early in life that is driving your behavior without
  your knowledge. Core assumptions are always dire (no one will buy your
  product), untrue (you never come up with good ideas), and usually have a
  familiar ring to them (I’ve felt like this before). These core assumptions are
  beliefs created in childhood to protect us. They represent a child’s notion of
  what we need to do to be safe. In order to break free of these beliefs you
  must:


  *   Identify your core assumptions

  *   Look for evidence that proves it to be false

  *   Explore the history behind your assumption

  *   Challenge your assumption.


  **Change requires you to grow beyond your limiting beliefs and develop a new
  consciousness that is free of these invisible constraints.**

  ### You're all mixed up... and it's okay!


  > "Don’t overvalue the nagging whispers to stay in the cozy corner of
  the-way-it-is-now… you don’t have to be 100% committed, only 51."- This Year I
  Will, page 32


  There is one part of you that says, “I want to lose 20 pounds so that I can be
  sexy again” and there is another part of you that says, “Give me a honey bun
  and a bag of flaming hot Cheetos, NOW!” The author says that ambivalence is
  normal. It is simply a reminder that your emotional brain loves easy. The
  important first step to getting over this hump is to recognize that **it’s
  okay to feel ambivalent.** The second step is to accept the challenge of doing
  something new, and then take action. The next step to overcoming ambivalence
  is calculating the price of not changing. This is your so what, it defines the
  consequence of not taking action and determines if you care enough to put in
  the effort required to succeed. **Every decision has a price but it is only
  when you realize that the consequence of not changing is worse than whatever
  you have to go through, that you will put in the required effort to succeed.**
f_conclusion: >-
  _This Year I Will_ is a very powerful book. It gives you insight into what you
  need to do to accomplish your goals and explains why you are in the way of
  your state goals and objectives. Everything comes down to your mindset and the
  way your thoughts make you feel. **I remember talking to my co-worker and
  explaining that I would rather die than continue working for someone for the
  rest of my life.** It was in that moment that I realized how much my goal of
  being a business owner meant to me. My mind started to associate pain with
  being employed rather than the safety I was previously conditioned to believe
  in. That is not to say that I am not afraid of being self-employed, because I
  am. The difference is I am learning to find more pleasure in the freedom of
  being completely in charge of my life. It was this transformation in thought
  that also gave me the courage to walk away from fourteen years in the Air
  Force when others urged me to stick out the last six years until retirement.
  The thought of being subject to military obligations for another six years
  became painful. The fear of walking away from the service I have known since
  age eighteen was immense but the pleasure in taking control of my life was
  greater. **Your goals need to be sticky.** Sticky goals really matter to you,
  evoke positive motivation, and their accomplishment is a must (no equal
  alternative). They need to compel you on multiple levels in order for you to
  persist and work through your emotional sticking points.

**Every New Year’s Eve friends and family gather to party like it’s 1999.** Whether or not you actually make a New Year’s resolution, we all march into the New Year hoping for something epic to happen: greater health, greater wealth, and more happiness. But, for those that actually take the extra step beyond mere hope, the statistics are dismal.

According to a Marist Poll, four out of ten Americans (40%) planned to ring in 2013 with resolutions to be thinner, exercise more, spend less, and save more, or some other proclamation of becoming better. Of those that made a resolution, roughly two-thirds will keep it for at least part of the year. **But only 8 percent will actually succeed.**

The question is, **where do broken resolutions go?** Can they find their way home? The answer to these questions and many more are answered by M.J. Ryan’s book, _This Year I Will_. Within the pages of this book, you will unlock how to bridge the gap between the excitement of new resolutions and the resolve required to achieve those goals and objectives.

You are committed. You repeat a motivating mantra to yourself every morning; “I am smart enough.
