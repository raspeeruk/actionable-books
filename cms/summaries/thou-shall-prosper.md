  ### Buy In to Yourself


  > "For better or worse, humans are holistic. Even the human body does best
  when its spiritual and physical sides are synchronized... People's bodies
  perform best when their brains are on board with the program... Helping your
  mind to believe what you do is good, noble, and worthwhile in itself helps to
  fuel your energies and propel your efforts."- Thou Shall Prosper, page 22


  As you think about business, and the people involved in it, what immediate
  thoughts come to your mind? Take your time, and while you’re thinking, ponder
  this: If you watch popular TV shows or movies, who are most often the bad guys
  in the films? Business people. A strange shift has been taking place in our
  culture, Rabbi Lapin points out, where what was once a noble and honorable way
  to go out and earn a living (picture Jimmy Stewart in _It’s a Wonderful
  Life_—he was a BANKER!) is now seen as a scummy cesspool filled with
  deplorable men and women. And honestly, not much could be further from the
  truth.


  As Rabbi Lapin walks the reader through each Commandment, the common theme he
  brings up in each is that **our mindset on our business, and how we all earn a
  living, plays a significant role in how much our income is.** You need to,
  from a spiritual, mental, and physical level, have your “whole self” on board
  and bought in to the **concept that commerce is good and your profession is
  noble** before you can hope to achieve success. Once you have this buy in, you
  begin to push yourself into new areas that before had mentally been
  unavailable to you.

  ### Sabbath: Stop the pouring


  > "The Sabbath - the effect is to create a tranquil oasis in time and space
  from which the future can be effectively contemplated. For 25 hours each week,
  Jews are required to put aside all work related objects and activities. They
  are to abstain from activating any form of technological machinery, such as
  cars, televisions, computers, or phones. In fact, all devices that assist Jews
  in reaching out of themselves into the outer world and impacting it are off
  limits."- Thou Shall Prosper, page 258


  In our connected world, when was the last time you went more than 1 hour
  without a cell phone, laptop, tablet, e-reader, or other electronic device?
  How about 15 minutes? Today, you can tweet from the toilet, update your
  adventures to all your Facebook friends while with your real life friends,
  order a book from Amazon while driving down the highway. The list is endless.


  **With all this reaching out into the world we can easily slip into a pattern
  of not reaching inward to ourselves.** The Jewish recognition of the Sabbath
  represents a way to turn the tide on this electronic onslaught and refocus
  ourselves on what our minds are telling us.


  Have you ever wondered why all these amazing ideas can occur to you when
  you’re in your shower? With the rushing water (and hopefully no electronic
  devices near you…electric shock therapy will be covered in a later summary),
  your mind is free to access the deeper parts of itself. And during this time,
  you can continue building upon the thoughts, prayers, and actions you are
  undertaking to step out in faith.


  Give this a try this coming weekend, or even when you get home from work:
  **Shut your phone off.** Lock it in your car if you have to, give it to a
  neighbor that has a huge dog and tell him you can’t get it back until a
  certain time period has gone by. After a few minutes of detox, you may find
  new and amazing thoughts come to you that you would never have had had you not
  stopped pouring into your brain.


  Beliefs shape one’s actions far more than facts do. What are you beliefs about
  business? Is it moral and right to want to achieve, and to step out in faith
  for unknown adventures?

  ### Prayer, Faith, and Focus


  > "If facts are all you master, then you will always be valuable to the
  leaders, but you are not destined to become a leader yourself… When I use the
  word FAITH, I mean the ability to work as comfortably with something yet
  invisible as if it were already a present reality. You alone see the desired
  outcome in front of your eyes, as plainly as if it were already a reality."-
  Thou Shall Prosper


  Faith is, as the Rabbit stated, belief in the intangible and unknown. We never
  have complete grasp of all our circumstances; the times, people, and dynamics
  in any encounter are often changing faster than we can count. However, when
  one has faith, you are able to take that step off the edge and jump into the
  pool with a mindset focused on your objective.


  Prayer is one way that Lapin suggests taking this step out in faith. **Not
  only does he recommend prayer, he recommends stating it audibly for you to
  hear what your voice is asking for.** Going back to our point of being
  holistic in the The Big Idea, this allows your physical voice to capture the
  thoughts of success much differently than if you had just let the synapses
  fire across your brain in thought. The physical act of moving your mouth,
  speaking the words, and basking in your faith as you step into the new unknown
  are something that require your mind, body, and soul to be united as one.

  yourself around these two related notions: 1) You are in business and 2) the
  occupation of business is moral, noble, and worthy."

> "Step one in the process of increasing your income is to begin wrapping yourself around these two related notions: 1) You are in business and 2) the occupation of business is moral, noble, and worthy." _\- Thou Shall Prosper, page 19_

How much would the wisdom of men from thousands of years ago, when Apple meant an apple, teach us about current business practices? It turns out, very much. Thus is the case of _Thou Shall Prosper_ by Rabbi Daniel Lapin. Rabbi Lapin is a bi-vocational Rabbi, meaning he not only leads his congregation but also engages full throttle in the world of commerce and business. The concepts that he teaches are based off of ancient Jewish tradition and culture.

Rabbi Lapin’s language is clear, straightforward, and challenging from the moment you pick up his hearty discourse. **Below are his 10 Commandments for Making Money:**

1\. Believe in the Dignity and Morality of Business  
2\. Extend the Network of your Connectedness to Many People  
3\. Get to Know Yourself  
4\. DO NOT Pursue Perfection  
5\. Lead Consistently and Constantly  
6\. Constantly Change the Changeable, While Steadfastly Clinging to the Unchangeable  
7\. Learn to Foretell the Future  
8\. Know Your Money  
9\. Act Rich: Give away 10% of your After-Tax Income  
10\. Never Retire
