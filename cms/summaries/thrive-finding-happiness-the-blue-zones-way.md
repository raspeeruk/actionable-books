  ### It's The Little Things That Add Up


  > "The secret to achieving happiness in your own life lies in making subtle
  changes in your surroundings to create gentle but ever present nudges."-
  Thrive, page xiv


  Every minute of each and every day we make choices about what we do and how we
  see the world around us. _Thrive_ shows us that it is the combination of
  little choices that determines our happiness or lack thereof.


  Is your environment nudging you in the right direction? Dan challenges you to
  change your environment to make nourishing choices a routine part of your
  life. He shares six life domains or “thrive centers” that we can shape to
  boost our long-term chances for happiness: workplace, social life, financial
  life, home, self. If you set up these thrive centres right, they will
  constantly nudge you to happiness.

  ### Socialize and Volunteer


  > "If you think about yourself, your problems will be endless – you’ll have a
  new pain in your back, some part of your car will need fixing, your savings
  account won’t be big enough. Fix one problem, and a new one always appears to
  take its place. But when you worry about someone else’s problems, or volunteer
  your time, you take the light off of your own troubles."- Thrive, page 163


  Those who volunteer at least two hours a week are happier. Maybe it’s because
  of the social aspect. Dan quotes a study carried out by Gallup-Healthways that
  shows that “spending six to seven hours in social time each day helps to
  maximize their well-being.”


  Or maybe volunteering is powerful because it gives us occasion to lighten up
  and laugh. He tells us that laughter has been associated with many health
  benefits including lower stress levels and the release of beneficial hormones.


  Or maybe it’s because it means we “belong” to something. According to one
  study, joining a group that meets even once per month produces the same
  happiness gain as doubling your income! (Makes you want to meet once a week!)


  Or maybe because it helps us feel gratitude. He suggests that up to 90% of
  happiness comes from actively appreciating the good around us. The more we can
  take the focus off ourselves and forget our own problems, the happier we will
  be.


  Or maybe it is because it helps us limit our work hours to 40 per week. Those
  who have long work hours, he says, are more likely to suffer chronic diseases
  and a poor family life.


  The message is clear. As little as two hours of volunteering per week can make
  you significantly happier.

  ### Show Me the Money! Or NOT!


  > "‘We’re not rich because we have a lot of money,’ he said. ‘We’re rich
  because we have few needs.’"- Thrive, page 164


  Which of the following do you think would make you authentically happy:
  Wealth? Youth? Beauty? Awards?


  According to Dan, it’s none of the above! Your needs determine your wealth.
  Why do we spend so much effort and energy trying to attain more money when the
  trick, he says, is to work for contentment? Most of us have the keys to
  happiness within our grasp but we are aiming for the wrong target.


  Dan found that those who thrive tend to possess enough money to cover their
  basic needs. And rather than striving for more cash, they focus their time and
  energy on developing a caring group of healthy friends, working at meaningful
  jobs, engaging in enriching hobbies, staying in reasonable shape,
  volunteering, and belonging to faith-based communities.
f_conclusion: >-
  And let’s face it. The one thing we ALL want, plain and simple, is to be happy
  (and for our children to be happy). What else could be more important? But
  most people spend more time doing things we think will make us happy (working
  for that next promotion sound familiar?) instead of trying to distill exactly
  what makes us happy.

  "On average, 50 percent of individual differences in happiness is influenced
  by our genetic makeup, 10 percent is influenced by our life circumstances, and
  40 percent is influenced by how we think and act every day."

> "On average, 50 percent of individual differences in happiness is influenced by our genetic makeup, 10 percent is influenced by our life circumstances, and 40 percent is influenced by how we think and act every day." _\- Thrive, page 13_

But how should we think and act? Dan Buettner travelled the world to find out. He interviewed people in 4 unlikely “happy zones” who had achieved authentic happiness and he shares those answers in _Thrive: Finding Happiness the Blue Zones Way_.

Putting on his storytelling hat, Dan makes you feel like you are a fly on the wall in the engaging interviews. Then switching to his research hat, he distills the interviews into lessons that you can use to be happier and turn your environment into a “happy zone” – conducive to creating happiness for you and those around you. His book is like a manual on how to set up your life such that you can thrive without really trying.

Love without suffering jealousy  
Eat without overindulging  
Never argue  
And once in a while, with great discretion, misbehave.”_
