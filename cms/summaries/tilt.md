  ### Discover your Downstream Competitive Advantage


  > "But when this account rep left to join the competition, the company
  realized that its efforts had made the customers loyal to the frontline
  salespeople, not to the company"- Tilt, page 93


  The author tells a story about a company struggling to keep its customers from
  leaving for the competition. At first, it seemed that their strategy was
  focused on the downstream. They grew their front line sales team, provided
  extensive training on the product line, and offered performance incentives to
  encourage employees to build deep relationships with their customers.


  For a while, it worked. But when their top account rep was wooed by the
  competition and left the company, they learned that their employees weren’t a
  sustainable competitive advantage. You want to build a great team, but the
  team alone won’t make your company great. You need something more, some
  downstream activities that create value for existing and potential customers…

  ### Sharing your Knowledge


  > "You come into contact with a variety of customers, each with unique needs,
  problems, challenges, desires and resources… you gain a wider range of
  experience on these issues than any single one of your customers can possibly
  have"- Tilt, page 83


  As an organization, you have a bird’s eye view of the market you serve.
  Individual customers have their own experience but know little about other
  customers’ experiences with your product or service. So now that you have this
  knowledge, what can you do with it?


  There are three ways to use your knowledge to create value for customers. The
  first way is **Relaying and Connecting**, which is when you learn from one
  customer, and use what you learn to help another customer. You may even go as
  far to introduce two customers, knowing that they could benefit from knowing
  each other.


  The second way is **Benchmarking and Mirroring**. This method adds value using
  the data you have to show customers where they rank compared to other
  customers on areas that are important to them. This could be fertilizer use
  vs. yield for a farmer, or number of Twitter follows and re-tweets for a
  social media manager.


  The third way is **Predicting**. Predicting uses your knowledge of the
  marketplace to forecast upcoming trends. It’s no doubt the most difficult to
  build, but once a model is created based on your customer data, it’s a
  competitive advantage that is difficult for your competitors to replicate.


  In conclusion, if your company is looking to differentiate itself from your
  competition, look to create additional value for your customers through your
  distribution, marking and service activities. Make doing business with you
  easy for your customers, and offer solutions rather than just selling them
  product x or product y.

  ### Reducing Risks and Costs


  > "The CEO should be busy seeking out more customers who value a similar
  reduction in costs and risk and uncovering additional costs and risks that the
  firm can reduce for its customers"- Tilt, page 203


  Instead of leaving this task solely to the CEO, everyone who deals with
  customers should ask themselves why customers are buying from your company
  instead of your competition. What problems do your products or services solve
  for your customers? Do they reduce costs, whether that’s the cost of your
  customer’s time or effort? Or do they reduce risk, such as the risk of making
  the wrong decision? One of the examples the book provides is a company selling
  wine in Britain. In order to grow their market share, they created a simple
  colour coding system to help people who don’t know much about wines. Rather
  than trying to determine if they needed a zinfandel or a pinot noir, all they
  needed to know was that red labels meant “light and fruity” to ensure they
  picked the right wine for their tastes. With this system, the company was able
  to reduce the time and effort that it took for customers to select and
  purchase a bottle of wine and they also reduced their risk of purchasing a
  wine that they wouldn’t enjoy.


  If your product or service can reduce the costs and risks for customers, not
  only will you attract new customers, but your existing customers will see more
  value in your product or service and be less vulnerable to the competition.

_“By now, your business knows what it takes to make and move stuff. The problem is, so does everybody else”_

_–_ Tilt, page 202

From the industrial age into the mid-1900s, competitive advantage was about economies of scale. The winners were those who could produce and distribute goods at a lower cost than their competition. However, in today’s world, where manufacturing, operations and logistics can be outsourced, what activities can truly set a company apart from its competitors?

In _Tilt_, Author Niraj Dawar introduces the “Tilt Strategy”, which encourages companies to stop focusing on “upstream activities” and tilt their focus to “downstream activities” to create a more sustainable competitive advantage. What’s upstream and what’s downstream, you may ask?

Upstream activities are those related to scale and production efficiencies. If your focus is on the upstream, you’re likely asking yourself, “How much more of this stuff can we sell?”

Downstream activities are those focused on the customer – such as distribution, marketing and service. If your focus is on the downstream, you’re asking yourself, “What else do our customers need?”
