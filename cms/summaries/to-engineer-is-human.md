  ### Define the “Puzzle” and the “Solution”


  > "After the fact there is a well-defined ‘puzzle’ to solve to show how clever
  one is. Before the fact one must not only define the design ‘puzzle’ but also
  verify one’s ‘solution’ by checking all possible ways in which it can fail."-
  To Engineer is Human, page 90


  Armchair quarterbacking is much easier than playing the game. Political
  analysts are quick to catch the missteps of politicians. Letters to the editor
  often criticize “obvious” flaws. Catching and correcting mistakes after the
  fact is like solving a crossword puzzle. All you have to do is make the
  answers fit. We feel smart for seeing the right answer someone missed. Often
  the person who made a mistake is a leader in their profession, not an
  incompetent fool. Nevertheless, the consequences of the error may be
  devastating.


  Analyzing mistakes is an excellent way to prevent future errors. The problem
  is many blunders are possible but have not happened yet. Usually, strategies
  work when the future resembles the past because plans often focus on
  preventing previous errors. When the future deviates from the past, plans may
  fail. Often, this happens when we have innovative ideas. When we put our ideas
  into action, they also shape the future, which makes it even harder to define
  all weaknesses. Read on to the Insights for some ways we can spot flaws.

  ### Computers Dilute Our Experience


  > "And as more complex structures are designed because it is believed that the
  computer can do what man cannot, then there is indeed an increased likelihood
  that structures will fail, for the further we stray from experience the less
  likely we are to think of all the right questions."- To Engineer is Human,
  page 200-201


  Computers can store and process large amounts of information quickly. They are
  good at plans that are not innovative and meant for a tried and true purpose.
  There are limits to their efficacy. They are prone to error partially because
  their speed and efficiency foster overconfidence in users. Instead of
  double-checking data, the computer accepts the input. Computers are great at
  filtering to the degree a user may never see what is important. It may have
  the wrong answer because it cannot make judgment calls based on its
  experience. The computer cannot identify the small piece of the puzzle that
  will fail. Only an experienced human mind recognizes nuances and weaknesses in
  facts.


  There are many typical examples of how using information from computers can be
  misleading. Relying too much on spell-check can cause more errors than it
  corrects. An online search for a new restaurant will deliver results based on
  how the user entered the parameters and how closely that matches the site’s
  description of what they want. An exercise app might compare calories burned
  doing pushups and running, but it takes a knowledgeable user to distinguish
  the benefits of each exercise. Computers are only tools, not a replacement for
  human contemplation.

  ### Find Counterexamples


  > "While the initial structural requirement of bridging a space may be seen as
  a positive goal to be reached through induction, the success of a designer’s
  paper plan, which amounts to a hypothesis, can never be proven by deduction.
  The goal of the designer is rather to recognize counterexamples to a
  structurally inadequate hypothesis that he makes."- To Engineer is Human, page
  104


  A counterexample is an example that disproves a theory. Using logical
  reasoning alone creates a plan that works on paper but may fall short when put
  into action. Find examples where others in similar circumstances had tried
  this before and failed. Analogous to a new design created by an engineer,
  situations in life may not have an exact match. The key is to break the puzzle
  into pieces and look for familiar parts that have failed under similar
  circumstances.


  We can trick ourselves into believing a plan will succeed because we have
  identified the differences between our scheme and the ones that have failed.
  The differences are often untested theories that look good on paper. They may
  even be a distraction from real problems. The pieces of the plan that resemble
  failures of the past may be the same things that will cause this plan to fail.

  As I read this book, I thought of Shakespeare’s Macbeth. In the beginning,
  pretentious Macbeth believes he is invincible, and he cannot lose his
  ambitious political conquest but in the end, there is a pivotal moment where
  Macbeth verbalizes his epic failure, “And all our yesterdays have lighted
  fools the way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking
  shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then
  is heard no more.” In this poetic paradigm for failure, the light illuminates
  the truth, blocking the light creates a shadow or hides the truth, and the
  shadow walks and others follow and meet their demise. The misconception
  masquerades as the truth until the show is over and reality is clear. Too
  often, we dismiss the tragedy and move on without understanding the fatal
  error.

  "What the engineers of the nineteenth century developed and passed down to
  those of the twentieth was the trial and error of the mind over matter. They
  learned how to calculate to obviate the failure of structural materials, but
  they did not learn how to calculate to obviate the failure of the mind."

> "What the engineers of the nineteenth century developed and passed down to those of the twentieth was the trial and error of the mind over matter. They learned how to calculate to obviate the failure of structural materials, but they did not learn how to calculate to obviate the failure of the mind." _\- To Engineer is Human, page 62_

In _To Engineer is Human,_ an erudite exposition of engineering failures, Henry Petroski explores the reasons designs and structures fail. He incorporates examples of everyday objects and basic designs as well as large complex design failures. He cites several literary passages in the book that illuminate or obfuscate human failure and help illustrate his ideas. Each case study reinforces his underlying theme: engineering is more than precise science it is also human judgment, and humans have a proclivity for error. If we identify and analyze the mistakes, we can learn from them and improve our results.

As Petroski examines the nuances of engineering, he illustrates several ways that we make decisions often for aesthetics, simplicity or comfort that ultimately compromise our enjoyment and quality of life or even cause death. Always, failure is a learning opportunity and the means for making progress. He describes engineering as an art, a working hypothesis that evolves as we continuously reevaluate mistakes. I used to study architecture, so I am a little partial to the paradigm, but I cannot think of a better way to analyze decisions in business and life.

Some formulas for success work under some conditions and not under others. Distinguishing weaknesses between theories to find the best one can be difficult. Using some of Petroski’s Engineering examples from the book, I have outlined how to define your problem before taking action and two ways to identify a solution that may fail.

Macbeth’s demise has a lot in common with engineering disasters. The plans seem sound and the magnificent structure designed to be invincible. Some unforeseen flaw causes the trusted structure to fail which often causes injury or death. Because we are human, our plans and errors share common characteristics whether it is a political miscalculation or a design problem. Flaws may present themselves as a systematic failure, error or an accident, misunderstanding or miscommunication. It is not possible to obviate every flaw, but learning from the rich history of trial and error of others is like standing on the shoulders of great thinkers. We can see farther and make better decisions in the brief time we have to make a significant contribution.
