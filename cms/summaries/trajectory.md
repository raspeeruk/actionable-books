  ### Your Trajectory Belongs to You


  > "Through all of these periods and milestones you should pause along the way
  for introspection to ensure that you are still doing that which is important
  to you…\[your trajectory\] can change as your circumstances and aspirations
  evolve."- Trajectory, page 18-19


  Throughout the 7 strategies, Van Rooy consistently emphasizes the importance
  of being open to change and acknowledging that trajectories can change
  dramatically. This is sometimes in response to other changes outside of an
  individual’s control, but it is important that as an individual you choose how
  you approach your response to these outside influences. He also notes that
  what can appear as negative circumstances can become very positive experiences
  which are also self-affirming where individuals exercise their choice.


  The book contains 7 strategies which David calls ‘lessons’:


  1.  The power of feedback

  2.  This identifies the importance of seeking meaningful feedback, having the
  internal capacity to accept what you hear and empowering people to feel
  comfortable providing you with feedback. Readers are encouraged to “think of
  feedback as a compass – something that when used frequently and correctly will
  keep you on your trajectory” (51).

  3.  Persistence as a differentiator

  4.  See Gem 1 for more detail on this lesson.

  5.  Think big, act small, move quick

  6.  This outlines the importance of thinking long term but reaching your goals
  through small actions and quick moves. This is important because each success
  provides you with greater resolve and determination to try even harder to
  pursue and achieve your goals.

  7.  Breaking through plateaus

  8.  According to the author, everyone is likely to experience a plateau, and
  this is not always a negative situation. However, readers are cautioned
  against viewing a plateau as no longer requiring their growth and development,
  it remains important to keep up to date with skills and knowledge – without it
  your future can lead to stagnation.

  9.  Avoiding the stagnation trap

  10.  This builds on what can happen if individuals become disheartened or stop
  growing and learning or doubt their abilities. This lesson brings together the
  previous lessons and identifies how they are all useful in lessening the
  chances of falling into this trap.

  11.  Achieving growth from failure

  12.  See gem 2 for more information.

  13.  Sustaining outlier performance

  14.  This involves bringing together and enacting all the previous lessons to
  reach point of ‘sustained performance’ and as such be someone who stands out
  from the crowd as a role model and to succeed at being your best.

  ### Failure Breeds Success


  > "If you fear failure you will also begin to limit your creativity and
  risk-taking – your willingness to think big…And when you fear failure you also
  will begin to procrastinate."- Trajectory, page 162


  This lesson is based on the concept that learning from failure and seeing it
  as constructive means that we can develop even steeper upward trajectories for
  ourselves. Van Rooy acknowledges that “humans are hardwired to have an
  intrinsic fear of failure” (159) but that we need to avoid learned
  helplessness. This is where we decide that factors and people outside our
  control determine our success whereas success is our choice and it is what we
  choose to do in responding to the ‘failure’ that matters. This requires that
  we learn from our mistakes and don’t allow our failure to be the reason we
  give up, and remember the importance of persistence. We need to use failure
  and learn from it to know how to avoid it in the future, or at least not
  repeat the same mistake, “if past is prologue, then you must learn to use your
  past – including failure – to write what happens next” (167).

  ### Persistence is Critical for Success – Talent Won’t Get You all the Way


  > "It is persistence that truly differentiates those who are successful from
  those who are not. Leaders with this key attribute continually look into the
  future and set goals for themselves, regardless of any prior failures or
  setbacks."- Trajectory, page 57


  I loved this idea that ability, whilst important, needs to be coupled with
  persistence if success is to be achieved. Van Rooy bases much of this lesson
  on research and identifies that linking your ability with persistence will
  give you an ongoing differentiator in life. Persistence increases when you are
  involved in doing what you love, and it is emphasized that this intrinsic
  motivation will amplify your performance. Today there is a lot of talk about
  the importance of authenticity in life generally and in leadership. Van Rooy
  quotes Tony Hawk who explains that “you cannot be fully authentic if you are
  not intrinsically connected to your goals” (60). It makes sense that this
  intrinsic drive is facilitated through applying persistence.


  This lesson has a simple but significant message: “you cannot entirely change
  your ability, but you have much more control of your willpower and how
  strongly you persist toward your goals” (66).

  This was a great book to read and the activities at the end of each chapter
  were extremely useful in assisting me in thinking about my own career
  trajectory and identifying my own goals and aspirations over the next 3 to 5
  years.

> "Every person has a trajectory. Your trajectory is the path you create for yourself." _\- Trajectory, page 7_

The start of a new year represents a renewed emphasis on planning and identifying objectives. It therefore seemed appropriate pick up _Trajectory_ by David L. Van Rooy in order to consider my career plans for the new year and beyond.

The book opens by identifying the fact that organizational culture must be managed as intentionally as an individual’s career trajectory. The first chapter defines what a trajectory is, how and why it is unique to each individual. The author emphasizes the importance of planning, and consistently reviewing and checking where you are, so that you can be prepared for any unexpected opportunities that arise. The key takeaways from the first chapter are that it is your trajectory (and no-one else’s), you own it, design it, are accountable for it, and can choose it! Each chapter ends with an activity to help reinforce the messages of the previous chapter and to assist you in thinking about your own trajectory.
