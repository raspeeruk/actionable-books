  ### Clarity is Power


  > "Our lives are the sum total of the choices we’ve made. Embrace the
  challenges and struggles. They are a necessary ingredient for victory!"-
  Author Unknown, Transformation, page 4


  No matter their age, did you know 68% of people believe they’ve already lived
  their best years? Far too often we drift along on auto-pilot, going through
  the motions and accepting what is. Contrary to these stale beliefs, the author
  vocally asserts it’s never too late to embrace an audacious vision for your
  life.


  To step out of this conformity-driven mindset, though, the pain of remaining
  the same must become greater than the pain of change. Only then will the
  decisions plus choices we make also alter.

  ### 10 Things Winners Do Differently


  > "A person’s true character will always show up during times of question."-
  Transformation, page 83


  From her list of success factors, the author then goes on to reinforce that
  the best is in store for you, so give yourself permission to be brilliant and
  excellent. On their road to championship, winners:


  1.  **Take 100% responsibility.** Your life is your statement to the world.

  2.  **Focus on the controllable.** What seems to be in your way is part of the
  way.

  3.  **Eliminate the wrong things.** There comes a point when you have to
  choose between turning the page and closing the book, so you can write a new
  one.

  4.  **Shape their day.** Either you run your day or your day will run you.

  5.  **Keep good company.** Some feed your spirit while others drain it. Give
  the gift of your absence to those who do not appreciate your presence.

  6.  **Think constructively.** Change your thoughts and you change your
  reality.

  7.  **Conquer yourself.** Knowing yourself is the foundation of wisdom (and
  it’s better than winning a hundred battles elsewhere in life.)

  8.  **Practice self-love.** Caring for you is not an act of self-indulgence;
  it’s an act of self-respect.

  9.  **Work through the pain.** Sometimes it takes the worst pain to bring
  about the best change.

  10.  **Keep going.** Don’t quit.


  Borrowing on the latter point, Shannon adds that even when you think there’s
  no point to carry on (and even when people say you can’t do it), pick yourself
  back up. A few months from now you will be so much closer to your goal than
  you are now. Focus on the road ahead. Do something today for which your future
  self will thank you.


  If I may say, I find it hard not to be ignited by the many thought-provoking
  insights Tobin offers from her own transformational experiences. As the
  back-cover testimonials state, she’s not just a savvy business woman with a
  track record that consistently places her in a number one position within her
  industry. With her commitment to life-long learning, she clearly possesses a
  mentor’s heart.


  It is her fervent goal to develop and bring out others’ unique abilities so
  they can realize their dreams. As she extracts from Veronica A. Shoffstall’s
  poem_: “Plant your own garden and decorate your own soul. Instead of waiting
  for someone to bring you flowers… You really can endure. You are strong. And
  you really do have worth.”_


  Let’s now go out there and be bold with our actions! Have fun living out loud!

  ### Success Is an Inside Job


  > "When you make up your mind that ‘the best’ is the only thing you will
  accept everything else that is less than the best will be eliminated."- Author
  Unknown, Transformation, page 43


  Following your dream no matter what others say, is vitally important if we’re
  to move from settling or surviving to thriving. One way to do this is to run
  your own race and never compare yourself to others. When you do, you’re
  comparing your worst to their best.


  Here are some other tips Tobin offers to step into your personal power:


  *   **Make a list of 30 reasons why you want what you want**. Look at that
  list every day. Revisiting and visualizing it keeps you committed and moving
  forward.

  *   **Have a bounce-back mentality.** If something doesn’t go according to
  plan, get back up again. You’re never down; you’re either up or getting back
  up.

  *   **When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.** There is always one; you
  just have to find it.

  *   **Don’t let the actions and opinions of those who don’t matter hold you
  back or influence your decisions.** Remember that we become like the five
  people we most surround ourselves with.

Right from her opening encouragement (“Emerge into Your Greatness!”), we recognize the power and passion we’re in for with _Transformation: Discover Your Own Flight Pattern_. Shannon Tobin’s purpose is clear. Her vision is to inspire, motivate and move us realize our greatest strengths lie in who we already are. This volume is all about the freedom to be, to do, have, live, give and receive.
