  ### Elevate or Die


  > "As the complexity of tasks and their technological requirements have
  soared, people have been pushed into Stage Four. Today, business schools
  believe their mission is to turn out team players – although the evidence
  suggests they are really turning out Stage Three people who can act like Stage
  Four individuals."- Tribal Leadership, page 30


  In a nutshell, the speed and complexity of today’s work world requires **Stage
  Four**


  **Tribes**. Logan, King and Fischer-Wright define a Stage Four Tribe as having
  **shared values**, **a noble cause** (larger than the aspirations of the
  individuals), **triadic relationships** and a clear, shared **strategy for
  making history**. While all four of these attributes deserve individual
  attention (and receive it in the book), a concept that may be new to people is
  the idea of **triadic relationships.** The best way to understand the meaning
  of the term is to compare it to how most of us (48% of American professionals)
  _currently_ operate… at Stage Three.


  In a Stage Three Tribe, the individual team members are out for personal gain.
  There’s a sense of personal greatness – a feeling that is reinforced through
  the constant comparison to (and disregard for) other people. In a world where
  “knowledge is power” – one dominated by an “I’m the best” mentality – people
  tend to form **one-to-one** relationships, trading information and ensuring
  that they need to be called into every decision. (Think: typical front line
  employees who need to call their manager for every decision that steps beyond
  their training manual.)


  Consumers don’t have the patience for this. Strong employees don’t have the
  patience for this. And, as we’ve seen with exceptional companies of the 21st
  century (Zappos, South West, Apple, etc.), companies can soar when their
  employees are empowered to make their own decisions within the structure of
  clear values and objectives. **Triadic relationships are those that include
  three parties, all working to strengthen the relationship between the other
  two**. Apple (the company) empowers their front line employees to make
  decisions in the best interest of the customer. That employee flourishes under
  the freedom, and Apple shines in a positive light to the customer. On a
  personal level, Triadic relationships allow strong networks to form; people
  aligned in values moving faster and accomplishing more than the traditional
  “hub and spoke model” (one-to-one relationships) based on fear and personal
  gain.


  We need to elevate our companies to the rarified air of Stage Four if we want
  to stand a chance at competing. The following two Insights should help get you
  started.

  ### Hallmarks at Stage Four


  > "…the two most important aspects of owning Stage Four: identifying and
  leveraging core values, and aligning on a noble cause."- Tribal Leadership,
  page 155


  If you, like most of us, are working in a tribe that is living at Stage Three,
  there are a few things you can focus on that will help elevate your tribe to
  Stage Four.


  The first is defining your tribe’s **Core Values**. Since Stage Four is
  defined by standing **united** against a common enemy, defining the core
  values needs to be a collaborative exercise. Too many organizations define
  their values in the executive boardroom, and then “share” them with the rest
  of the company. Your values don’t need to be created, they need to be
  uncovered and the best way to do that is to include as many people as possible
  in the process. A Stage Four Tribe is about **We**.


  The second aspect of Stage Four is uniting under a **Noble Cause.** What’s the
  change you’re trying to create in the world? In the words of [**Simon
  Sinek**,](https://www.actionablebooks.com/videos/vol-5-with-simon-sinek-starting-with-why/)
  what’s your tribe’s **Why?**


  Defining these two elements, collectively, will help bring your team a long
  way in aligning under the “We’re great” language.

  ### Your Language Defines You


  > "At each cultural stage, there is a specific ‘fingerprint’ made up of
  language that people use and observable behaviour toward others in the tribe.
  These two almost always correlate perfectly."- Tribal Leadership, page 21


  As the authors of _Tribal Leadership_ express very clearly, “Tribal Leadership
  is not about changing ideas or gaining knowledge; it is about changing
  language and relationships.” The language used by the people in your tribe
  becomes your anchor point for understanding where you’re currently operating.
  Here’s an overview of the language and mood that are commonly experienced at
  each stage:


  **Stage One: “Life sucks”**  

  _(Less than 2% of the population)_


  People stuck at Stage One understand that life is inherently cruel, and that
  all of us are destined to suffer. Staying at Stage One for too long can often
  lead to crime or even death.


  **Stage Two: “My life sucks”**  

  _(25% of workplace cultures)_


  People at Stage Two believe that life is good for some people, but not for
  them. They become despondent, typically doing the bare minimum and resisting
  change or growth, seeing it simply as “more work”.


  **Stage Three: “I’m great (and you’re not)”**  

  _(48% of workplace cultures)_


  This is how most of us operate. We vie for personal recognition and accolades,
  reassuring ourselves of our personal greatness by comparing ourselves to one
  another. Our education system trained us to think this way (bell curves and
  percentile rankings), and our workplaces (typically) reinforce it.


  **Stage Four: “We’re great (and they’re not)”**  

  _(25% of workplace cultures)_


  This is where greatness lives. At Stage Four, team members unite against a
  common enemy – another organization or a wrong that they’re trying to right.
  At Stage Four we see a reduced amount of politicking, and a speed of business
  that people at Stage Three can’t understand. Stage Four is also the launch
  page to Stage Five.


  **Stage Five: “Life is great”**  

  _(Just under 2% of workplace cultures)_


  Logan, King and Fischer-Wright have yet to see a company that sustains Stage
  Five status, but they’re optimistic that such a thing is possible. At Stage
  Five the “common enemy” so integral to Stage Four fades into the background.
  The mood at Stage Five is defined as “innocent wonderment”, with employees
  speaking in hushed, almost irreverent tones about the things they’re
  accomplishing together. Stage Five is where world changing breakthroughs
  occur.


  **Look at the language above. Which stage are you at?**
f_conclusion: >-
  Two thoughts as we wrap up here… First, only attempt to grow by one level at a
  time. It’s impossible to jump from Stage Two to Stage Four without first
  passing through Stage Three, so if you find yourself at a “My life sucks”
  stage, work with your people to help them realize their own personal
  greatness. Only after they’re saying “I’m great” can they become open to
  embracing “We’re great”. Secondly, remember that Stage Four, as great as it
  is, is only a platform for Stage Five bursts of creation and genius.

_Tribal Leadership_ is one of the best books on leadership that I’ve read in a long time. Why? Because it addresses the current state of **all** tribes (a group of 20-150 people), along with practical, actionable guidance on how to (a) identify where your tribe currently stands and (b) how to elevate the abilities, mindset and accomplishments of your team, regardless of where you’re starting from.

Through extensive research, co-authors Dave Logan, John King and Halee Fischer-Wright have identified **five stages** of tribes. Every organization exists at one of these stages, and can be defined by their priorities and way of operating. Each stage even has its own defining language. (More on language in insight #1.)

There’s genius in the pages of _Tribal Leadership_, far more than we could possibly cover in this summary. Certainly, if you lead a team you should read it, but I also encourage you to pick up a copy if you’re feeling stuck, or underwhelmed by your work. We all aspire to greatness in one way or another; I believe this book is an excellent map for getting there.
