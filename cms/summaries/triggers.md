  ### It’s The Environment


  > "If there is one 'disease' that I’m trying to cure in this book, it revolves
  around our total misapprehension of our environment."- Triggers, page 26


  A good friend of mine, Matt Tod, uses the phrase, “Awareness creates choice.
  Choice creates change” and I always thought that it was such a great way to
  describe how we go about making changes in our lives. It all starts with
  awareness of our surroundings and of ourselves.


  But awareness is not enough when we’re dealing with something as complex as
  our environment. If you’ve ever come home from a long day of work or school
  where you were highly focused and engaged, but the moment you step through the
  doors you become a tired (or worse) irritated family member or partner, you
  know what I mean. You may be aware of your behavior change but you might not
  have the tools or skills to deal with this shift.


  Goldsmith suggests looking at our environment “as if it were a person – as
  imminent and real as an archrival sitting across the table.” When we look at
  our environment as a real person the challenge becomes more dynamic and
  situational. Sometimes our environment can present us with very positive
  triggers (e.g. our boss commending our work) or negative (e.g. a snarky remark
  from a colleague) but what really matters is our reaction to them. Once we
  understand the power the environment has over us, we can then begin to make
  the necessary adjustments to overcome the negative triggers.

  ### AIWATT


  > "AIWATT is the delaying mechanism we should be deploying in the interval
  between trigger and behavior – after a trigger creates an impulse and before
  behavior we may regret."- Triggers, page 158


  AIWATT stands for the following:


  _Am I willing,  

  at this time,  

  to make the investment required  

  to make a positive difference  

  on this topic?_


  Goldsmith suggests that every time you get triggered by your environment, you
  go through the AIWATT. _Am I willing_ makes your response to the trigger a
  choice and not a reaction. _At this time_ makes you think whether now is the
  appropriate time to respond to the trigger or should you wait until later. _To
  make the investment required_ reminds us that responding to a trigger takes
  energy and allows us to ask ourselves whether the response is worth our time.
  _To make a positive difference_ places the emphasis on the gentler side of who
  we are and how we can make the situation better. And finally, _On this topic_
  asks us whether the matter at hand is something we actually can make a
  positive difference on – sometimes we just can’t make a positive difference.


  For me, it’s an interesting idea and I know it’s going to be a bit of a
  challenge to remember the phrase every time I get triggered. But hey, it’s
  better than being overwhelmed by a trigger or not having a response at all.
  Whether it be a debate with a colleague or an irritating conversation with a
  family member, I can practice implementing AIWATT to ensure I can react in the
  best way possible to my triggers.

  ### Six Daily Self-Questions


  > "That’s the secret power of daily self-questioning. If we fall short on our
  goals eventually we either abandon the questions or push ourselves into
  action."- Triggers, page 123


  One of Goldsmith’s key takeaways in the book is implementing what he calls the
  “Daily Questions”. It’s a series of questions you ask yourself at the end of
  the day to see how well you did with each one. You then give yourself a score
  between 1 and 10 for each. For any of you that have tracked your habit changes
  in the past like tracking your workouts or monitoring your calorie intake,
  this’ll probably sound familiar.


  Where Goldsmith strikes gold is in _how_ you ask the questions to yourself.
  Instead of asking yourself “Did you exercise today?” he recommends starting
  the question with “Did you do your best?” When you start the question with
  “_Did you do your best?”_ it puts the onus on the effort that you put into
  achieving that goal. Sometimes we don’t meet our daily goals but at least we
  can _try_ our best to achieve them.


  This was a huge insight for me. I’ve tracked myself in the past to measure my
  habits and productivity but I could never really sustain it. I often got
  demotivated after a couple of days of lackluster results. The Daily Questions
  is a new weapon in my arsenal and I’m excited to give the six fundamental
  questions he provides in the book a shot. I’ve been recording my scores over
  the last couple of weeks and the process has been much more tangible and
  rewarding so far.


  Here are the six questions to ask yourself daily:


  *   _Did I do my best to set clear goals today?_

  *   _Did I do my best to make progress toward my goals today?_

  *   _Did I do my best to find meaning today?_

  *   _Did I do my best to be happy today?_

  *   _Did I do my best to build positive relationships today?_

  *   _Did I do my best to be fully engaged today?_

  So how does your environment impact you at the moment? Does it serve you or
  does it prevent you from becoming the person you want to be?

> "This is a book about adult behavior change. Why are we so bad at it? How do we get better at it? … To answer these questions, I’ll be focusing on the triggers on our environment. Their impact is profound." _\- Triggers, page xv_

Marshall Goldsmith has worked with some of the most influential CEOs of our time and coached them on making behavioral changes in their personal and professional lives. In his book _Triggers_, he examines how environmental triggers can derail us and shares strategies on how we can overcome those triggers to become the best versions of ourselves.

If you’ve been looking to make a change in your life and found yourself getting stuck, this is a book for you. Behavior change is quite possibly the most difficult challenge that we come across in our lives. We’re battling ingrained habits and environmental queues, and having the _right_ tools at the _right_ time is paramount to your success. Read on to find out what some of those tools are and start implementing them into your life today.

### AIWATT

AIWATT stands for the following:

_Am I willing,

to make a positive difference  
on this topic?_

Goldsmith suggests that every time you get triggered by your environment, you go through the AIWATT. _Am I willing_ makes your response to the trigger a choice and not a reaction. _At this time_ makes you think whether now is the appropriate time to respond to the trigger or should you wait until later. _To make the investment required_ reminds us that responding to a trigger takes energy and allows us to ask ourselves whether the response is worth our time. _To make a positive difference_ places the emphasis on the gentler side of who we are and how we can make the situation better.

But hey, it’s better than being overwhelmed by a trigger or not having a response at all. Whether it be a debate with a colleague or an irritating conversation with a family member, I can practice implementing AIWATT to ensure I can react in the best way possible to my triggers.

So how does your environment impact you at the moment? Does it serve you or does it prevent you from becoming the person you want to be?

_Triggers_ gave me some practical tools to apply to my life immediately and like any good habit, it’s going to take some time to implement and find consistency with. But starting with a proven system that has worked for some of the top leaders in the world seems like a great place to start!
