  ### Get your head out of the cyber sand


  > "We are currently living in a communications environment where there is a
  trust deficit."- Trust Agents, page 14


  The one sided, “media megaphone” advertising model of the last 50 years is
  broken. For over 5 decades, we blindly followed the recommendations of
  television, radio and print ads for years, supporting bigger and more generic
  shopping centres, buying things we didn’t need (or even really want, if we
  stopped for a moment and were honest with ourselves); mindlessly consuming all
  that we were told to, like good little civilians. And then we woke up. The
  economy is in shambles, our job security is shaky at best, and the direction
  we’ve been following is leading us not to happiness, but to debt and (as
  Thoreau brilliantly put it) to lives of quiet desperation.


  The web has changed that. For the first time in over half a century, we have a
  mainstream opportunity to take part in the conversations we want to take part
  in. The power to have a voice, and to choose which voices to listen to. The
  Web of the 21st century is, first and foremost, about personal connections.
  Paradoxically, this freedom, sprung upon us over a very short period of time
  (the internet as we know it has only been around for 14 years, after all), is
  a bit overwhelming to say the least. We suddenly have thousands of ways to
  take in information, and (for the first time ever) an equally large number of
  ways to share our opinions as well.


  The mainstream media doesn’t help. Every day there’s a new social media
  platform that we “need” to be on (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube,
  DailyBooth and Flickr as only a few of the many potential examples). And so
  we’ve entered a period of online panic. Like young children playing hockey,
  many of us swarm around the latest “opportunity”, without a clear sense of why
  we’re doing it, or what we’re supposed to be doing. Instead, we’re there
  simply because we don’t want to miss out.


  In _Trust Agents,_ Brogan and Smith simplify things. The Internet (and all its
  iterations) are tools. Nothing more, nothing less. Is twitter a powerful tool?
  Absolutely. Provided it makes sense for your message, and your business. But
  for a lot of people it’s not.


  Brogan and Smith’s message, loud and clear, is this: online communication
  tools are simply an easy and inexpensive way to connect with people – either
  to build new relationships or, ideally, to further develop those that you’ve
  established offline. Just like any human interaction, all social media
  presences need to be guided by integrity, honesty and purpose, leading towards
  establishing a level of trust. I repeat – the specific tool doesn’t matter.
  All successful relationships online (and off) are about trust. Once you
  realize that, and handle yourself accordingly, there are some pretty neat
  things you can do to harness the Web fairly simply.

  ### Create Idea Handles


  > "In building armies, and giving your ideas handles such that people can
  execute in alignment with your shared beliefs, there's extra power that trust
  agents can use: scalability."- Trust Agents, page 235


  The true value of the Web is that transcends time and space. For the first
  time ever you have the ability to connect with like-minded people around the
  globe in real time, virtually for free. While this is great in a social
  capacity, it also has incredible potential in the business sector. Precisely
  because communication online is free, people will (and do) regularly promote
  projects, passions and products that they believe in. You, as a trusted member
  of the digital world (provided you handle yourself with integrity, and build
  real connections) have the ability to harness that stream of communication to
  promote your projects, passions and products, you just need to think about it
  in a new way. You need to give your ideas handles. You need to make it easy
  for like-minded tribe members to pick your idea up, and carry it with them in
  their online travels. Make an idea easy to share (repost, retweet, etc.) and
  your idea will spread at a rate previously unbelievable. It happens every day
  with other people’s ideas, why can’t it happen with yours? As a starting
  point, try to think of a way to express your idea, purpose and desired action
  in 140 characters or less. If you can manage that, your message can be spread
  on virtually every social network in existence.

  ### Listen Twice, Speak Once


  > "The thing is, everyone is not your customer, and everyone isn't the
  audience you want to influence, which is the difference between a trust agent
  and a 'brand evangelist.'"- Trust Agents, page 112


  Imagine you’re going to a networking event. Armed with your business cards and
  elevator pitch, you jump into the room and before even shaking hands you start
  handing out cards, blabbering on about your products and your company,
  completely ignoring the actual people you’re trying to sell to. can you
  imagine how effective this approach would be?


  Online interactions are no different. Or rather, there is one key
  differentiator – people aren’t picking up your body language, tone or other
  non verbal cues. All they have to go on are your words. So be precise and be
  careful with those words. Better yet, don’t use any at all. At least not at
  first. Listen to the conversations going on – whether the conversation is in a
  LinkedIn group, a Facebook fan page or on a blog. Again, the vehicle doesn’t
  matter. Every conversation (in type or otherwise) is a give and take. It’s
  about listening, truly hearing, and then providing value. This doesn’t
  suddenly change when you go online. People aren’t suddenly receptive to your
  canned, one directional sales pitch just because they can’t see your lips
  moving. The lesson here is simple – think of every new blog you’re visiting,
  or online group you’re entering as a party where you don’t know anyone.
  Introduce yourself, listen, and look for opportunities to build real
  connections. Be human first. The business will follow.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Trust Agents_ is a great book, surprisingly simple to digest (considering the
  tech-expert status of the authors), and full of brilliant, applicable tips on
  how to harness the web to accomplish your goals. More than anything though,
  reading its 260 pages gives one reason to breathe a sigh of relief. The web
  isn’t that complicated. Really. The tools for expressing oneself and
  connecting may have changed (and continue to change), but the qualities of
  successful people are eternal; treat people with respect, ask questions before
  you ask for favors, and have integrity in everything you do. If there’s one
  thing that’s universal about online discussion it’s that they amplify and
  solidify the traits the communicator already has. If you’re a good person, who
  is fair and compassionate with others, is passionate about their work, and has
  a clear sense of where they’re going, the Web is your friend. Just don’t
  forget that it’s there to work for you, and not the other way around.

You’ve heard the term paradigm shift before, but it’s been a long time since I’ve read a book that truly encapsulated the meaning of the term. In their brilliant book _Trust Agents,_ “digital natives” Chris Brogan and Julien Smith demystify the online world and teach us that using the web as a pro may not be as difficult as you think.

The Web, for all its hype and intricacies, is a tool. Yes, it’s advanced, yes, it’s multifaceted (billions of facets, really), but at the end of the day, it’s simply a technological tool, to be utilized to save time, money and energy, just like any other advancement of the human race. Brogan and Smith compare it to a car, a highway system, airplanes and the telephone – you could get by without it, but learning how to harness it’s awesome power is essential to compete in the global market. From [_The Long Tail_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-long-tail/), we learned what the Internet has done to barriers of entry (eliminated them). From [_Crush It!_](http://actionablebooks.com/summaries/crush-it/) we learned of the splintering effect, and how virtually any passion can be turned into a business through hard work and commitment. _Trust Agents_ teaches us something all together different – how to humanize the online world, and to use it as a continuation of our “offline”, real world conversations.
