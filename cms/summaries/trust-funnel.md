  ### Build Your Audience’s Trust


  > "When it comes to Web marketing, you’re either adding value or you’re
  annoying people."- Trust Funnel, page 48


  In order for any aspects of the business to work well, you need to gain and
  build your audience’s trust. Johnson suggests that audience trust is developed
  through a couple of key factors:


  *   **Visibility online** – Are you easy to find on different social media
  sites? Do you have a substantial following? These are a couple of questions to
  consider about online visibility.

  *   **Ranking on Google** – In many ways, Google helps pre-determine who we
  should trust online based on ranking. The higher the ranking, the more
  reputable a site and person are perceived to be.

  *   **Quality and consistent content** – When a site is publishing quality
  content on a consistent basis, we recognize them as being a great authority.

  *   **Personal brand** – Aside from the company, people want to be able to
  relate to the people behind the company. In this sense your personal brand
  matter just as much as the company’s.


  Johnson goes on to expand on the topic of content throughout the book, noting
  that content is key to building audience trust, website traffic and sales. One
  of the key mediums that Johnson suggests using is YouTube. “I urge you to take
  inventory of what you’re doing day to day, how you’re spending your time, and
  modify your workflow to produce more video based on the needs and wants of
  those in your market”. There are a couple of technical reasons why Johnson
  recommends this. 1) YouTube is the third most popular website on the plant,
  and the second largest search engine. 2) Making yourself visible to your
  audience in multimedia form helps them get to know you better.

  ### Stay Audience and Customer Focused


  > "Find out what people want, and give it to them. This rule applies to
  everything that impacts your online marketing…"- Trust Funnel, page 29


  One of the common ideas that Johnson returned to in the book was adding value
  to your audience and customers. By focusing on adding values, you establish
  yourself as a go-to person on a certain topic. The other benefit is that you
  show them that you care. That’s not just about you and your success. It’s
  about _them_ and _their_ success. In order to do this well, it is absolutely
  necessary to stay in touch with your audience and customer. Listen through
  social media. Read their blog comments. Ask them questions. This will provide
  you with valuable data points that will show you what your audience really
  wants from you, that in turn can help you develop better products and content.

  ### Mindset Matters


  > "It’s human nature to come up with reasons why you’re not ready, capable or
  in a position to share."- Trust Funnel, page 22


  Johnson includes a great chapter early on in the book about the importance of
  your mindset. In your business or work, mindset is the combination of your
  principles, outlook, vision and beliefs. It is the thing that helps drive you
  forward towards your goals. And ultimately, if you don’t have the right
  mindset then it can be difficult to move forward. Each person’s mindset is
  unique as we are all motivated differently. But what Johnson underscores for
  readers is that it is important to be self-reflective. Johnson sums this up as
  embracing who you are and striving to be the very best you.


  Additionally, there are a few key things that you can do on your path to
  success:


  *   Know your goals, and have a plan of action and a vision as to how you will
  reach your desired goals.

  *   Don’t allow naysayers to dictate your future.

  *   Chose to narrow your focus. You don’t have to do everything all at once.
  In fact it’s more productive to focus on a few key projects that help you work
  towards your primary goal.

  *   Develop daily routines to help you get the important work done.

  Johnson has packed _Trust Funnel_ with an incredible number of useful tips,
  tricks, how tos and ideas. As someone who has been running an online business
  for several years, I found _Trust Funnel_ to be a great refresher on the
  basics that also includes a number of advanced gems.

  "Success is not about being the smartest guy (or gal) in the room, it’s not
  about being the first to discover the ‘perfect opportunity,’ and it’s not
  about having the best tools for the job (although great tools certainly don’t
  hurt). Rather, success is about assessing opportunity, creating a plan of
  action to achieve a desired outcome, and prioritizing daily efforts to meet
  that goal."
