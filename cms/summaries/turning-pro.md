  ### There Are Two Paths: Amateur and Pro


  > "\[W\]hat ails you and me has nothing to do with being sick or being wrong.
  What ails us is that we are living our lives as amateurs."- Turning Pro, page
  5


  The core of Pressfield’s message is that **when we continually give in to
  Resistance**, whether it’s by avoiding our art, by embracing addictions of all
  kinds, or by working a “shadow career” where we do something close enough to
  pretend, but which is not our real art, **we are still an amateur.** He uses
  his own definitions of the words “amateur” and “professional” but he uses them
  in a sense any of us can understand. The distinction is **not** about the
  quality of our work or whether we get paid for it.


  It’s about **belief**. Commitment. Integrity.


  _Turning Pro_ is about **deciding** that it’s time to put on your big boy
  pants and **do the work.** To sit down, day after day, 9 to 5, and type out
  the words, or hammer at the anvil, or whatever it is you have to do to create
  your art; your contribution to a better world.


  A pro creates **habits** to enable success in the daily battle against
  Resistance. A pro shows up in the morning, sits down, and gets busy. An
  amateur sleeps in, or gets up early but has other things to do before the
  work. A pro works. An amateur tweets.


  A pro’s life isn’t easier than an amateur’s. It’s not harder, either. But it
  is, most definitely, different.

  ### Turning Pro is Simply a Change of Mind


  > "In the moment, an epiphany feels like hell... It exposes us and leaves us
  naked. We see ourselves plain, and it’s not a pretty picture."- Turning Pro,
  page 85


  You do not need better **tools**. You do not need more **time**. You do not
  need **training**. You do not need **help**.


  My very first job was as the first employee of a friend’s janitorial service.
  We cleaned stuff. Windows. Bathrooms. Floors. Big deal.


  **He was a pro.**


  He had no formal training for any of it, but he showed up and did the work.
  And when I didn’t, he’d say, “Joel, you know, **you know** that’s not good
  enough.” And I did. I knew it. He knew it.


  Difference was, he **did** it. He did the work, and empowered himself with
  everything he could.


  When he could afford better **tools**, he got ’em.


  Over **time**, he got better at everything he did.


  He **studied** the craft of cleaning. Mastered it.


  And he **learned** from anyone who’d talk to him. Even me.


  Turning pro is a **decision**. It’s a decision to move from one list to the
  other, up there in insight #1.


  But then, jumping from an airplane is also just a decision. If you’ve got your
  chute strapped on and you’re standing at the door, you jump, or you don’t.


  **Just a decision.**

  ### Are You an Amateur or a Pro?


  > "The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits."-
  Turning Pro, page 20


  An amateur is stopped by their **fears,** lives for the opinion of **others,**
  is easily **distracted,** seeks **instant gratification, lacks**
  self-compassion, seeks **permission,** and will be ready **tomorrow.**


  The pro **shows up** every day, **acts** in the face of fear, is dedicated to
  **mastery,** is **not distracted,** and **does not wait for inspiration.**


  **You** know whether you’re an amateur or a pro.


  Thing is, **others don’t.** They can’t tell if you’re doing a great job at a
  shadow career, or a mediocre job of something amazing. **Nobody else can
  know** about that glowing coal hidden in your gut.


  But you know. And you know which list you’re on.


  If you’re a pro, I salute you.


  If you’re an amateur, shame on you for withholding your grace and art from a
  world that could sure use some of it.


  And lest anyone take offense at my shaming, it is, in fact, **my shaming.**


  **I’m an amateur.**


  Oh, I’m real good at a lotta things. But I know where I fall. I haven’t turned
  pro. Not yet. I see it. **I know it’s out there, on the fringe of the woods.**
  But I’m still huddled by the fire, building courage.

  Pressfield claims that, like the day JFK was shot, like 9/11, you always
  remember where you were the day you turned pro.

Steven Pressfield knows more about suffering than I do. If you’ve ever tried to create something, you know what that means, but I’ll spell it out for anyone who’s confused.

**Everything worth doing is art.** The obvious stuff – writing, painting, sculpting – is art, certainly.

There’s another kind of art though, and it exists in your **business,** in your **life**.

If you’re trying to do something with real **meaning**, something **not quite orthodox,** you have felt what traditional artists feel every day: **Resistance**.

In Pressfield’s earlier book, [_The War of Art_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/the-war-of-art/)_,_ he detailed what Resistance is, and how to combat it. It was originally titled _The Writer’s Life_ so it’s no surprise that it’s slanted toward those who share Pressfield’s profession. But as a man of broad vision, he knows that we all face Resistance, what Seth Godin calls the lizard brain. When we try to do something important, **the voice in the back of our head tries to stop us.**

In many cases, it wins. Even those of us who’ve read and re-read _The War of Art_ until it’s worn have succumbed to Resistance.

**We needed more than awareness.** We needed a tool, a path, a flashlight.

_Turning Pro_ is a flashlight on the path.

### Insight #1

An actionable way to implement the Big Idea into your life

### Are You an Amateur or a Pro?

> "The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits."- Turning Pro, page 20

An amateur is stopped by their **fears,** lives for the opinion of **others,** is easily **distracted,** seeks **instant gratification, lacks** self-compassion, seeks **permission,** and will be ready **tomorrow.**

The pro **shows up** every day, **acts** in the face of fear, is dedicated to **mastery,** is **not distracted,** and **does not wait for inspiration.**

**You** know whether you’re an amateur or a pro.

Thing is, **others don’t.** They can’t tell if you’re doing a great job at a shadow career, or a mediocre job of something amazing. **Nobody else can know** about that glowing coal hidden in your gut.

But you know. And you know which list you’re on.

If you’re a pro, I salute you.

If you’re an amateur, shame on you for withholding your grace and art from a world that could sure use some of it.

And lest anyone take offense at my shaming, it is, in fact, **my shaming.**

**I’m an amateur.**

Oh, I’m real good at a lotta things. But I know where I fall. I haven’t turned pro. Not yet. I see it. **I know it’s out there, on the fringe of the woods.** But I’m still huddled by the fire, building courage.

You do not need better **tools**. You do not need more **time**. You do not need **training**. You do not need **help**.

My very first job was as the first employee of a friend’s janitorial service. We cleaned stuff. Windows. Bathrooms. Floors. Big deal.

**He was a pro.**

He had no formal training for any of it, but he showed up and did the work. And when I didn’t, he’d say, “Joel, you know, **you know** that’s not good enough.” And I did. I knew it. He knew it.

Difference was, he **did** it. He did the work, and empowered himself with everything he could.

When he could afford better **tools**, he got ’em.

Over **time**, he got better at everything he did.

He **studied** the craft of cleaning. Mastered it.

And he **learned** from anyone who’d talk to him. Even me.

Turning pro is a **decision**. It’s a decision to move from one list to the other, up there in insight #1.

But then, jumping from an airplane is also just a decision. If you’ve got your chute strapped on and you’re standing at the door, you jump, or you don’t.

**Just a decision.**

Pressfield claims that, like the day JFK was shot, like 9/11, you always remember where you were the day you turned pro.

I’ve been flailing and thrashing and struggling for nearly a decade of self-employment (following 25 years of employment) and I know I’m not there yet.

It’s only a decision, after all. **How hard can it be?**

It’s only as hard, I suppose, as losing weight, quitting smoking, fixing a damaged marriage, any of the other things which only take **deciding** — and then **doing the work.**

I have a goal. I have a tool.

Do I have the nerve?

**Do you?**
