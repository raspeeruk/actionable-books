  ### Six Factors in Building Buzz


  > "What’s an ideavirus? It’s a big idea that runs amok across the target
  audience. It’s a fashionable idea that propagates through a section of the
  population, teaching and changing and influencing everyone it touches. And in
  our rapidly/instantly changing world, the art and science of building,
  launching and profiting from ideaviruses is the next frontier."- Unleashing
  the Ideavirus, page 14


  Quoting some popular examples of ideaviruses, including Hotmail, Polaroid
  cameras, BlueMountain Online E-cards and Napster, Godin suggests that the
  success of an ideavirus is a function of a set of closely related, yet
  individually important factors that feed into its lifecycle. Godin argues that
  the ability of businesses to field successful ideaviruses depends on their
  ability to manage these various factors. How well (or how poorly) they do so
  will directly impact the lifecycle of the ideavirus.


  The **Velocity** of a virus depends on its ability to spread quickly from
  person to person.


  **Smoothness** is the metric of “share-ability”, the ease with which the
  ideavirus can be shared from consumer to consumer.


  The spread of an ideavirus also involves the use of “**sneezers**” – people
  who wield tremendous power in their ability to influence the choices and
  preferences and shopping decisions of others.


  The **medium** in which the ideavirus is encapsulated also affects the ease of
  its communicability, as does the persistence of the virus amongst members of
  your target consumer market (“hives”). (Effectively, how comfortable your
  intended audience is with the medium you choose, and how much value they get
  from the content)


  And ultimately, the spread of the idea through the hive can be affected by its
  Vector; that is, whether the idea thrives as it trickles from person to person
  in the hive, down the path of least resistance – and quickest acceptance.

  ### Bigger than Word of Mouth


  > "Ideaviruses give us increasing returns—word of mouth dies out, but
  ideaviruses get bigger."- Unleashing the Ideavirus, page 15


  Ideavirus marketing is not the same as word-of-mouth marketing. Word-of-mouth
  marketing is effectively “customer referrals”. You recommend your product to
  someone, they buy it, they personally connect with it and then, if it happens
  to come up in conversation, they promote it to someone else… from their own
  unique perspective, highlighting what they perceive to be the value. That new
  person needs to then seek out the product, be sold on its value and then buy
  it. The number of steps, and the fact that it requires explanation of a
  personal experience can easily lead to the buzz dying out rather quickly.


  Au contraire, an ideavirus sells itself – and has the potential to endlessly
  propagate itself as a result. The secret? It relies on the strength and
  transference of the idea itself and is not limited to a localized,
  personalized experience in the case of word-of-mouth.


  In fact, the only thing that stops the ideavirus from propagating itself
  endlessly are the limits built into the design of the ideavirus itself. That’s
  the difference. Unless the marketer wants or lets the ideavirus fizzle out and
  die on its own, the ideavirus can be made to linger in a market for an
  extended amount of time.

  ### The Medium (Can be) the Message


  > "Viral marketing is a special case of an ideavirus. Viral marketing is an
  ideavirus in which the carrier of the virus IS the product."- Unleashing the
  Ideavirus, page 22


  In a world dominated by the social web, and key websites such as YouTube,
  Facebook and Twitter, the advent of viral phenomena flashing across the
  internet may be taken for granted. But when you read about it in a book
  written four years before the advent of the social web, its prophetic ability
  is simply staggering.


  An effective viral marketing campaign builds its strength by encapsulating its
  very idea into the medium of the product itself, while also providing a means
  for the idea to be shared easily with others. Microsoft’s ubiquitous “Hotmail”
  grew in strength as a result of the little byline inserted at the bottom of
  each and every email sent (to this day, Microsoft still advertises with little
  messages at the bottom of every email sent from a hotmail account. Check it
  out for yourself – you must have a friend or two who uses Hotmail, no?)
  Hotmail dominated the free email account space for years by using their
  product to promote their product.


  If you really want to turn your product, service or brand into a killer, make
  sure you practice what you preach and thread your idea into the fabric of the
  product itself. Even better, build in a mechanism that allows others to share
  your idea quickly and easily, with minimum effort. A YouTube video wouldn’t
  become a viral video as easily if it wasn’t for the “Share” bookmarklets
  peppering the websites that undergird the social web. By posting and
  reposting, sharing and commenting on videos that go viral, you add the weight
  of your endorsement to the reputation of the video, while granting the video
  maker the permission to market similar videos to you in the future. That’s the
  essence of permission marketing married to the concept of an ideavirus.
f_conclusion: >-
  By presenting his ideas in the style of a pocket marketing handbook-cum-quick
  read, Godin manages to incorporate his very recommendations into his writing.
  Just as Niccolo Machiavelli’s The Prince influenced a whole generation of
  politicians and thinkers, Seth Godin’s Unleashing the Ideavirus stands to do
  the same for marketers – by opening their eyes to a newer, more effective
  marketing strategy relayed by one of the masters of the craft itself.

An indispensable item in the marketers arsenal, Seth Godin’s _Unleashing the Ideavirus_ is a follow-up to his wildly successful Permission Marketing. Evangelizing the concept of marketing your products and services only to the consumers who have given you permission to do so, _Unleashing the Ideavirus_ furnishes a solution to actually earning that permission in the first place.

Traditional interruption marketing relies on advertising to _“interrupt people with unanticipated, impersonal, irrelevant ads and hope that they buy something.”_

Ideaviruses do the opposite. An ideavirus avoids harassing consumers who are not interested, attracts the very demographic intended and earns permission along the way. An ideavirus builds “buzz”; it gets people talking amongst themselves, without the company or product needing it push it. A company that can master the art and science of the ideavirus early on, and rush to fill the vacuum of an unoccupied market, can brand itself a winner.
