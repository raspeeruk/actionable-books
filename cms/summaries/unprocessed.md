  ### Rethinking perfect


  > "Don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good."- Unprocessed, page 59


  My LEAST favorite business phrase is “done is better than perfect.” I think
  the phrase allows us to give less than our best effort in order to just be
  finished. However, Kimble tweaks the idea in a way that makes it far more
  productive, whether you’re considering making your own bread or creating a new
  marketing program.


  This idea can be applied to food, to work, to exercise, journaling, and really
  just about any aspect of your life. In Kimble’s unprocessed adventure, she
  starts with wheat. She’s a little frustrated to learn that buying whole wheat
  doesn’t mean that you are getting wheat that hasn’t been taken apart and “put
  back together”. She decides to grind her own wheat and make her own bread, but
  finds that may not be the best use of her time every time she wants bread.
  Later in the book she talks about processes that we readily pay for because we
  don’t have the time it takes to make all the food that we consume. So, early
  in her endeavor, she realizes that her year unprocessed will be a journey. If
  she tries to be perfect in every moment, she’ll miss out on the learning
  process and possibly give up altogether.


  I think that this is an important lesson for all of us, and not just in
  changing our food consumption. Forward motion is good. Perfect can be the
  enemy of that forward motion. Drink one more glass of water today and one less
  Coke. Exercise twice this week instead of zero times. Get the side salad
  instead of the fries. Test the marketing campaign to see how viewers respond.
  Get your intern to research a social media platform to see if it’s viable. You
  don’t have to be perfect every time. But if you make the best decision you can
  most of the time, you’re on the right track.

  ### Fail, learn and try again


  > "If I didn’t try to engage in the messiness, of eating out and eating with
  another, then even if I ate perfectly unprocessed, I wouldn’t really have
  lived unprocessed…today’s world is one of moderation. Of trying and failing,
  and then trying and half-succeeding."- Unprocessed, page 175


  Eating alone in her kitchen made eating unprocessed easy, relatively speaking.
  Kimble found that sharing meals with others, either at home or in restaurants,
  made eating unprocessed more challenging. But we all live in a world that
  includes other people. There is always someone to share the messiness with!


  It’s so important to try our best, fail, learn, and try again. The world has
  become so fast paced that we often think that we should be good at something
  as soon as we give it a try. I think we forget the beauty of failing and
  learning from our failures.


  I have an intern who is a part of two different projects. One is very fast
  paced, many short deadlines, and a more specific final product than the other.
  We had a great conversation where we talked about the difference between the
  pace of the projects. One is a test that may fail entirely and never go public
  while the other one will absolutely have a final published product. But
  failure of the one wouldn’t really be failure in my eyes. We have to research,
  consider our options, and decide our best course of action.

  ### Step-by-step


  > "Although I eventually succeeded with bread and chocolate, it is fun to make
  salt on my first try. This fun reminds me that, although I am still
  overwhelmed by unprocessed, it doesn’t have to be overwhelming always."-
  Unprocessed, page 129


  When Kimble started her year of unprocessed eating, she didn’t yet know what
  she could and could not eat. It was a year of unraveling what it really meant
  to eat unprocessed. She started out with wheat and sugar and found that there
  was a lot more to creating the things that we eat than she could have
  imagined. Although it was much easier to make (or extract) salt from ocean
  water, she found the process very time consuming. Even so, she took it one
  step at a time.


  When we have big endeavors, we should break them down and take them
  step-by-step. Some steps will be hard, and some will be easy. The easy steps
  and celebrating the small victories helps to alleviate feelings of stress and
  overwhelm. To go back for a moment to the The Big Idea, it’s easy to let the
  quest for perfection get in the way of progress. Breaking down an overwhelming
  project into manageable chunks makes it easier and more enjoyable.

  I learned a lot more from Kimble about life and business than I thought I
  would. There are food and business lessons in _Unprocessed_ than I could
  include. It was a great read and I would love to hear what lessons you can
  apply to your life and what you learn about food by reading about Kimble’s
  journey. Enjoy, and let me know what you think in the comments below!

> "We fret about what to select from overabundant produce sections. Busy, broke, and overtaxed by decisions, we want a label to tell us." _\- Unprocessed, page 112_

For the past few years, I’ve found myself very interested in food and fitness. I wanted to pick up Megan Kimble’s book _Unprocessed: My City-Dwelling Year of Reclaiming Real Food_ for a couple of reasons. I wanted to see what Kimble would uncover about how our food is made and what it takes to get it to us. You know. Beyond the labels. I really thought I would learn some easy ways to eat “cleaner”, healthier meals while traveling for work and play. While there are some things I picked up that could help me there, what I found were lessons that we can apply to our food, our work, and our lives.

Kimble tackles different categories of food, alcohol, and eating out. At the end of each chapter she gives a neat summary of a few ways that you can consider unprocessing your life. Some chapters give short recipes for things like bread, chocolate, pesto, mead, and how to can tomatoes. Read on for my thoughts on how Kimble’s ideas apply to business. Read the book to find out what Kimble learned about food.
