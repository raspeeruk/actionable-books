  ### Knowledge really is power


  > "Step into your customers’ shoes."- Value Proposition Design, page 23


  Whether you are a start-up or an existing business, correctly defining your
  customer segments will help you and your business stakeholders better
  understand what is most valuable to a customer.


  Of course it’s tough knowing and appreciating what matters most to customers
  if you aren’t prepared to step into their shoes. Daunting as the step seems,
  using the recommended _Customer (Segmentation) Profile_ is an easy tool for
  understanding customers in a way that allows you to experiment and evolve
  ideas within the everyday business context.


  The _Customer Profile_ is a 3-segment visual map to help you plot and
  understand the jobs (personal or work related) that your customers are trying
  to achieve on a regular basis, while identifying the most advantageous and
  undesirable benefits or attributes, referred to throughout the book as “pains”
  and “gains”, customers look for in products and/or services that will help get
  their tasks done.


  Suggested “trigger questions” lists within the _Canvas_ chapter also help with
  creative thinking as you set about creating your first Customer Profiles. You
  and your team members will soon be ranking the most important and
  insignificant specific “gains” or “pains” customers may be facing by asking
  questions like:


  *   “What are the main difficulties and challenges our customers encounter?”

  *   “What would make our customers’ jobs or lives easier?”

  *   “What risks do customers fear?”

  *   “How do our customers measure success and failure?”


  In a written context using the authors’ example profile of a “Business Book
  Reader”, segmenting this potential customer type with the _Customer Profile_
  tool revealed the following key insights:


  *   Business book readers largely undertake the “job” (task) of reading.

  *   To improve their skill set and advance their careers – a “gain”.

  *   That being stuck in a career or jeopardising one is a “pain” that ranks
  highly for this customer group.


  Therefore, a proposition to write a business book that is easy to use leads to
  results and helps communicate and sell ideas internally would be valuable to a
  potential business book customer.

  ### Don't Judge. Listen.


  > "In a great feedback culture people feel comfortable presenting (bold) new
  ideas early, knowing that they will evolve substantially…"- Value Proposition
  Design, page 134


  There are many new ideas, considerations, insights and value propositions that
  you will ultimately want to put to the test with your immediate team and wider
  company stakeholders as you work though your _Visual Proposition Map_. The
  Strategyzer Team stress throughout the book the importance of getting buy-in
  early, and continuously, from your colleagues to make sure your strategic work
  and conversations deliver actionable and relevant outcomes that align with
  your _Value Proposition Canvas_.


  De Bono’s Thinking Hats framework remains a valuable business model for
  collecting effective feedback. In _Value Proposition Design_, the authors have
  taken a new approach on the classic model by using just four (white, black,
  yellow, and green) of de Bono’s six thinking hats to gather feedback in the
  following six step sequence.


  *   Step 1 – **Pitch:** present the idea and value proposition or value canvas
  for a maximum of 15 mins.

  *   Step 2 – **White Hats on**: Your audience members can ask clarifying
  questions around the information and data for 2-5 mins.

  *   Step 3 – **Black Hats on**: Participants quickly write down the reason
  they thinks your idea is a bad one – difficulties, weaknesses are read out
  loud.

  *   Step 4 – **Yellow Hats on**: participants quickly write down a point each
  on why the idea is useful and then discussed.

  *   Step 5 – **Green Hats on**: alternative solutions to evolve the ideas are
  discussed in an open forum.

  *   Step 6 – **Evolve**: The presenting team takes the 4-hat feedback and
  evolves the idea.


  The compelling viewpoint for suggested success from the authors is to
  encourage your entire team to change their mindset and embrace a new way of
  “decision making” centred on information gathering and the power of feedback.
  You need them to listen to, not judge what you are proposing.

  Design, page 62


  The Strategyzer Team practice what they preach. You can’t help but like advice
  that is both practical and credible. The value proposition for the book itself
  has been inspired, tested, re-modelled and finally created using all of the
  instruction they impart, page after page.


  It becomes clear however, that the job is not done and dusted once you have
  profiled your customers; the real opportunity to take back to your teams is a
  system that enables you to identify the value your proposition can really
  offer them; understanding that to remain relevant, you must continue to
  nurture and evolve the “fit” of your products and services to match customer
  needs.


  Before you design your value proposition, however, take the time to review ten
  of the characteristics that make great value propositions outlined in the
  book:


  *   Great value propositions are embedded in all great business models.

  *   They focus on the jobs, pains and gains that matter most to customers.

  *   They focus on unsatisfied jobs, unresolved pains and unrealised gains.

  *   They target few jobs, pains, and gains, but do so extremely well.

  *   They go beyond functional jobs and address emotional and social tasks.

  *   They align with how customers measure success (personally and
  professionally).

  *   They focus on jobs, pains and gains that a lot of people have or that some
  will pay a lot of money for.

  *   They differentiate from competition on jobs, pains and gains customers
  care about.

  *   They outperform competition substantially on at least one dimension.

  *   They are difficult to copy.


  This list will help you stay focused as you start exploring ideas for your
  value proposition and assessing viable alternatives.

  _Value Proposition Design_ is a fantastic resource for existing businesses and
  new start-ups. Buying the physical book will unlock access to a stack of
  additional and awesome downloadable resources.

> "In today’s hypercompetitive world, customers are surrounded by an ocean of tempting value propositions that all compete for the same limited slots of attention" _\- Value Proposition Design, page 58_

Creating products and services that customers actually want can seem like a never-ending quest when you are in business. _Value Proposition Design_, a contemporary alternative to traditional business books, is an extensive toolkit of results-focused, shareable, easy-to-understand, applicable ideas that will help you stop creating “stuff nobody wants”.

Designed by the entrepreneurial team at Strategyzer, (the authors of international best seller _Business Model Generation_)_, Value Proposition Design_ centres on a strategic management tool, the “Value Proposition Canvas” to plan, try-out, make and manage the items you sell.

Divided into four practical sections: _Canvas_, _Design_, _Test_ and _Evolve,_ the core theme in each chapter is aimed at helping you uncover and realise ideal product “fit” – where your customers’ needs are meet by your value proposition.
