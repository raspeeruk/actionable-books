  ### Organization is much more valuable than individual talent


  > "HR is not about HR, but about delivering real value to the business."-
  Victory Through Organization, page 266


  Thriving companies use organization to create and take best advantage of
  talent after hires are made. Nurturing a staff culture that will be most
  beneficial to the organization’s customers, and managing effective employee
  development and recognition are part of what it takes. However, along with
  these organizational competencies, HR professionals as individuals need to
  devote attention to their less obvious, but extremely valuable, roles. These
  include being a Strategic Positioner, Credible Activist, and Paradox
  Navigator, and are required so that HR can have the influence it needs to
  deliver value to the business.


  The 9 HR competencies needed today are:


  1.  **Strategic positioner** – position a business to win in its market.

  2.  **Credible activist** – build relationships of trust by having a proactive
  point of view.

  3.  **Paradox navigator** – manage tensions inherent in making change happen
  (e.g. be both long and short term, be both top down and bottom up).

  4.  **Culture and change champion** – make change happen and weave change
  initiatives into culture change.

  5.  **Human capital curator** – manage the flow of talent by developing people
  and leaders, driving individual performance, and building technical talent.

  6.  **Total rewards steward** – manage employee wellbeing through financial
  and nonfinancial rewards.

  7.  **Technology and media integrator** – use technology and social media to
  drive high performing organizations.

  8.  **Analytics designer and interpreter** – use analytics to improve decision
  making.

  9.  **Compliance manager** – manage the processes related to compliance by
  following regulatory guidelines.


  When HR is more integrated with the business of the organization, teamwork
  often achieves more than the best talent. If the focus on talent is
  overemphasized, it can reduce HR’s ability to impact business performance.
  Even the most brilliant and apparently self-made entrepreneurs had significant
  organizational nurturing early in their careers.

  ### Focus on employee performance


  > "High potential individuals are interested in on the job assignments that
  are challenging and valuable … because they want to create a track record of
  documented results."- Victory Through Organization, page 166


  Using employee involvement to improve staff performance takes an
  organizational approach to the pervasive problem of low engagement. The goal
  is to move from cynicism to commitment, isolation to community, and for
  employees to have a sense of purpose and social responsibility in their work.
  Initiatives like letting employees choose their next project and being more
  involved with staffing issues have a positive effect on employee performance.
  Company-specific case studies are being used in training so that employees
  have more organizational knowledge, instead of generic knowledge that can more
  easily be used to move outside the organization, which leads to less turn
  over.


  One of the most interesting ways companies are involving employees is by
  connecting them with customers for feedback. This could mean having employees
  listen to customer service calls, engaging more employees in market research
  and social media, having customers visit the company’s office, having
  customers participate in employee training, and even locating employees to
  work out of a customer’s facility.


  Measuring employee performance from an organizational perspective means
  focusing on organizational-wide talent data, as well as individual data. For
  example, to measure recruitment, you can look at what percentage of hires
  remain after two years. To measure development, look at what percentage of
  promotions come from inside vs. outside the company. To measure succession
  readiness, look at what percentage of employees know the company’s mission,
  long-term goals, and business strategy.

  ### Become a Paradox Navigator


  > "As HR professionals master paradox navigation skills, they will have more
  influence and add more value."- Victory Through Organization, page 198


  Out of the nine critical HR competencies, the role of Paradox Navigator was
  most closely tied with business performance. Yet this is an area where many HR
  professionals were lacking expertise.


  Paradox navigators need to effectively manage tensions between:


  *   Global and local demands

  *   Need for change and stability

  *   Gathering information and making decisions

  *   Internal and external hiring

  *   Individual needs and collective needs

  *   Employees vs. customers and investors

  *   Top down and bottom up


  Dealing with cognitive complexity is the top skill that helps to transcend
  paradox. Cognitive complexity involves seeing different sides of an issue,
  respecting other people’s point of view, learning new ideas (20-25% every 2
  years), and seeing patterns in events.


  The authors have coached HR professionals to identify and list the paradoxes
  facing their organization, and then meet with people who represent each side.
  They recommend analyzing the ways competitors deal with paradox. Plus, any
  life experiences that involve solving problems with a group (e.g. starting a
  community garden) or bridging between two poles (e.g. teaching residents of a
  long-term residential living facility about technology) function to prime your
  mind for navigating paradoxes.


  How to transcend paradox:


  *   Clarify the poles

  *   Define best outcomes – how both sides relate to success criteria

  *   See others’ points of view – how do others experience the paradox?

  *   Find common ground – where do we agree and disagree?

  *   Take first steps.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Victory Through Organization_ gives HR professionals the tools they need to
  learn how to align their practices with an “outside in” focus, where staffing,
  performance management, training, and culture result in the most value for the
  customer. Having top talent is great, but if HR departments aren’t organized
  in a way that maximizes people’s skills and strengths, companies are missing
  out on one of their best opportunities.

> "The competitive advantage is what you do with the talent once you have it." _\- Victory Through Organization, page 63_

Over the past two decades, business leaders and HR professionals have gotten wrapped up in the war for talent. However, in their book _Victory Through Organization_, authors Dave Ulrich and Wayne Brockbank (and Mike Ulrich and David Kryscynski) show that really winning the war for talent involves much more than selecting the most skilled employees. It requires that an organization turn those employees into organizational capabilities.

In the shift to an information economy, HR has gone from playing a transactional role to being a foundational part of every business. The impact of an organization is many times more than the sum of their parts, and it’s the same with HR departments. So the authors outline both organizational and individual HR practices that have the most impact on personal effectiveness, stakeholder outcomes and business results. Based on over 30 years of research and advising hundreds of companies, they describe the key elements of the most effective HR departments.
