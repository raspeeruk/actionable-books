  ### Create Your Vision


  > "Our vision is an integral part of making sense of the world we live in and
  then acting within that framework to achieve our goals and objectives."-
  Visioning, page 9


  Visioning is the process of creating a detailed picture of what a successful
  life looks like in the future. It is a deeply personal expression of our
  desires for a meaningful live, and will look vastly different for each person
  who undertakes the exercise.


  The process is deceptively simple: pick a specific date in the future (could
  be a landmark birthday, New Year’s day, or any other meaningful day), and
  imagine your life on that day. Williams recommends imagining a day 5 to 10
  years from now—it’s far enough in the future to allow for expansive thinking,
  but not too far away to feel unattainable. Create a clear, specific vision of
  your life on that date, being sure to include visions for your physical,
  emotional, mental, and spiritual needs.


  Your job at this stage is to focus on the _what_ and _why_ of your vision, and
  to avoid the impulse to get bogged down in the _how_. Don’t worry about the
  logistics of achieving your goals—the methods will become clear as a result of
  figuring out what you want to achieve, and why it is important to you.


  Creating a clear vision is a four step process, outlined below (41):


  1\. Discovering: stimulating and inspiring yourself through connecting with
  ideas, images and impressions that potentially express elements of your
  vision.


  2\. Designing: representing your vision as symbols (through images, drawings
  or words) on index cards, sticky notes on a wall, a page, canvas, poster or
  computer screen.


  3\. Developing: synthesizing, organizing and refining the contents of your
  vision into a presentation format that suits your intended purpose (e.g. a
  poster, computer-based presentation, a typed or hand-written document).


  4\. Delivering: sharing your vision with another person (or people) is a
  pivotal stage that completes the first iteration of the creative, cyclical
  process. At this stage, you may think that you have not actually done anything
  about making your vision a reality. However, when someone else reads your
  vision back to you, or witnesses you speaking your vision aloud, you are
  likely to see yourself starting to think and feel differently about your
  vision

  ### Be Kind to Yourself—Visioning is hard work


  > "There is ample evidence that we need to spread out, wander, explore and
  even brainstorm before these kinds of answers come to us. We need to open our
  mind and senses to images, impressions, sensations, associations and what they
  stimulate before we begin the process of sense-making. This non-linear nature
  of the creative process has also been shown to be effective for people in
  endeavours as diverse as mathematical code breakers, inventors, entrepreneurs
  and artists."- Visioning, page 27


  The work of creating a personal vision is difficult, heady stuff. Williams
  strongly suggests that you carve out dedicated time and space to complete this
  exercise. If you’re trying to squeeze it in between emails, stressed about
  picking up your kids on time, or worried about an upcoming deadline, you will
  likely struggle to articulate a clear, meaningful vision.


  As the quote above indicates, to do deep, creative work, we need space to
  daydream and to wander. Many of Williams’ clients take a weekend away to
  complete this task. If you can’t spare a whole weekend, think about ways you
  can get out of your usual environment. It could be a long walk in a local
  park, a meandering drive around the countryside with no particular destination
  in mind, or a long extravagant lunch by yourself at a new restaurant. You want
  to focus on new opportunities—so get away from your usual environment.


  Williams also notes that it’s important to take care of yourself throughout
  the process. It’s difficult work, so treat yourself kindly—get a massage,
  ensure that you’re hydrated, break up your thinking with exercise, or treat
  yourself to whatever form of self care you find most comforting. You will be
  imagining a new, exciting future—difficult to do if you’re hungover or chowing
  down a burger.

  ### Make your Vision Specific


  > "Imagine that you are going to hand me a script for a movie. The more detail
  you can provide me, the clearer I shall be able to see your vision, through
  your eyes. It is not about whether you really end up living in that suburb, on
  that street or in that house, for example. However, that kind of level of
  detail would enable me to go away and make a movie – figuratively speaking –
  with you as the star of the show. Imagine me playing that movie back to you
  and your response simply being “yes, that is perfectly what I imagined my
  ideal future would look like in my vision."- Visioning, page 43


  Williams suggests articulating your vision in the present tense. As opposed to
  saying “by then, I will probably be running a successful business,” practice
  saying “I have a successful business,” and imagine what that _feels_ like (not
  what _it will_ feel like). It may seem like a subtle, or semantic shift, but
  the effects are profound. As you work through your vision, imagine it in vivid
  detail, like a film about your life that just happens to take place in the
  future.


  This shift in thinking will allow you to immerse yourself in your vision, and
  create the right image. By using the present tense, you can shift away from
  viewing your vision as a hypothetical—and receive the psychological benefit of
  envisioning your success as though it has already happened. Instead of
  focussing on process (which can lead to thinking about challenges and
  roadblocks before you really get started), your focus on what success will
  feel like, and will be more likely to chase after this feeling in the years to
  come.
f_conclusion: >-
  Though Williams created this process with executives who are already quite
  successful in mind, the process outlined in this book will be beneficial to
  people at every level of success. I didn’t know it at the time, but 5 years
  ago, I undertook a similar process. I had applied to go back to school
  (again), and spent many afternoons (before my shift at the bar) really digging
  into a vision for my future. I took long walks and let myself imagine what a
  successful career would look and feel like. Though I didn’t write it down,
  that vision sustained me through the grind of school, and a series of less
  than ideal jobs. Five years later, I’ve achieved my vision, and it feels
  better than I imagined. I will be returning to this process again and again,
  to help me stay connected to my goals, and to imagine what success feels like.

  “What most of us need is to genuinely feel optimistic, despite the passage of
  time. We need a way to stay connected to a broader vision of our lives,
  against which we can make sense of the challenges and obstacles we encounter
  during our lives.”

_Visioning: Creating the Life of Your Dreams_ by Glenn A. Williams provides an inspiring introduction to the process of envisioning a successful life. Part instructional manual, part gorgeous coffee table book, the process of reading _Visioning_ is both immersive and inspiring. The beautiful photographs throughout the book invoke serenity and introspection, and are balanced nicely with actionable advice for imagining a successful life. Williams walks us through the steps required to envision what our life will look like when we consider the questions: _What do you really want for your life? Why is that a meaningful pursuit? What are you dreaming about, but not doing?_

_Visioning_ is a powerful process that will help you connect to what matters most. It is deeply personal, and will look different for everyone who undertakes it.

_What does your vision for the future look like?_
