  ### Do You See What I See?


  > "Explicitly working with images and words on paper invites an open
  discussion of how people relate to different ways of expressing things."-
  Visual Leaders, page 47


  Sometimes what seems ‘crystal clear’ to us can be quite foggy and complicated
  to another person. There are lots of reasons why this may be, however the
  point I want to make in this context is that we will be far more successful in
  helping someone else ‘see’ our point of view, if we use a combination of
  images and words to convey our perspectives, rather than simply using words
  alone.


  This is not a new concept although it is one we often neglect. Consider
  assembly instructions – for everything from a model kit to a bicycle to IKEA
  furniture. We have more confidence when each step in the process is
  accompanied by a tiny diagram that shows us what part goes where and which
  tool we should use. Same goes for Google Maps and GPS devices. We can get by
  with just the written or verbal directions, however we are far more
  comfortable when we can see the route map and the street views associated with
  our journey.


  Why then do we circulate a meeting agenda (a visual map of the meeting) only
  to rely solely on verbal discussions to share our thoughts and ideas on the
  agenda items with others? The simple act of using white boards, flip chart
  paper or SMART Boards to capture keywords, themes and ideas can help meeting
  participants relate more fully to the agenda items and is a powerful way to
  acknowledge the different perspectives that participants bring to the
  discussion. Try it at your next meeting and see for yourself how the
  conversation changes.

  ### Seeing is Believing


  > "Human awareness is a dance between what we are aware of in our thinking and
  what we are communicating and hearing from others."- Visual Leaders, page 51


  I love the dance metaphor in the above quote. When we dance, and particularly
  when we dance with a partner, we need to use each one of our senses (except
  taste) in order to create a positive outcome. While many of us may think we
  dance like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, our actual moves are often more
  mechanical and clunky than we would like. With practice and the guidance of a
  good teacher, we can however become more accomplished dancers.


  The same holds true for visual leadership. Visual leaders recognize that
  employees’ thoughts and previous experiences generally drive their behaviours
  and choices. A deeper awareness of our own thought patterns and biases is only
  possible when we interact with and receive input from other people. This
  exchange of information (the dance) is all the more powerful when leaders use
  multi-sensory methods and feedback to help employees literally see different
  perspectives and connections and come to believe that change is both necessary
  and possible.

  ### From Mind Maps to Road Maps


  > "We value maps of places we visit when travelling because they help orient
  us but aren’t telling us where to go."- Visual Leaders, page 16


  Sibbet does a great job of illustrating how different visual tools and
  techniques can help leaders actively engage employees to:


  *   improve employee alignment with and ownership of the organization’s vision
  and mission,

  *   think big picture,

  *   readily recall strategies and plans, and

  *   understand how their individual work responsibilities contribute to
  organizational outcomes and results.


  One way in which he helps his readers visualize how they might apply these
  tools and techniques in their own organizational situation is to provide mini
  exercises that let you play around with the tool or concept. The other way he
  does this is by describing, and showing, how the HealthEast Care System used
  visual tools to help employees ‘see’ their way to extraordinary results.


  By telling the HealthEast story and, more importantly, sharing the visual
  products that HealthEast staff created, Sibbet helps orient us to the
  possibilities of visual leadership without telling us where to go or how to
  get there. We can see for ourselves what different ‘maps’ look like (from
  messy brainstorming ones to pretty public ones) and how they guided
  decision-making for a complex organization. Visual maps allow people to see
  how numerous and sometimes diverse pieces fit together into a bigger whole and
  understand those inter-relationships in a different way.
f_conclusion: >-
  Sibbet provides you with numerous tools and techniques that can help you
  develop your visual leadership muscles. You don’t have to be an accomplished
  artist to use graphic templates and incorporate visual tools to map out your
  work. You do have to silence your inner art critic and challenge yourself and
  your team members to doodle more often. If you are still hesitant to DIY,
  bring in a graphic facilitator to help you and your team get your ideas on
  canvas.

> "It’s visualizing that can provide us a sense of the whole, while still honoring and even celebrating the details out of which the whole arises." _\- Visual Leaders, page 212_

There’s something wickedly ironic about trying to share the lessons learned from a book on visual leadership using mere words to convey the richness of the content. And yet, that is precisely the challenge I need to rise to in order to do justice to David Sibbet’s book, _Visual Leaders: New Tools for Visioning, Management and Organizational Change_.

This book is jam packed with diagrams, templates, sketches, illustrations and cartoons that demonstrate how visualization tools and techniques can engage people and facilitate better outcomes – be that in business or personal contexts. You have likely heard the saying, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Well, if I stopped to count all the images in the book and then did the math, this book could easily be another 460,000 words and 920 pages long! That’s a lot of potential learning, people!

As Sibbet reminds us in the introduction of his book, “the younger generation is unabashedly visual. Videos, digital photos, graphics, interactive maps, games, movies and websites are taken for granted.” Quite frankly, the ‘older generation’ (and I’m really not THAT old!) has relied on visuals to champion their causes as well (think organizational charts, GANTT charts, pie charts, flow charts, bar graphs, and more recently PowerPoint and Prezi).

Technology is advancing the ways in which we communicate and effective leaders have recognized they need to leverage these new visual methods to engage successfully with employees and customers. So if a NASCAR driver can master ballroom dancing on _Dancing with the Stars_, surely you can learn how to become a more visual leader.

Well…what are you waiting for? Grab some Crayola’s and some flip chart paper and get visual!
