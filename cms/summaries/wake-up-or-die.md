  ### Use Data Intelligence For World Domination


  > "...it’s all about having superior intelligence and the wisdom to use this
  intelligence in a transformational way."- Wake Up or Die, page 20


  Ok, so maybe your goal isn’t world domination and your industry likely isn’t a
  battlefield, but using data and gathering intelligence is critical, as it
  allows you to understand the market and your competitors, as well as make
  course corrections along the way. Similar to using spies in military
  intelligence, b**usiness intelligence allows you to get into the minds of your
  customers and competitors and create what is needed, well ahead of other
  players.** As Sun Tzu notes in The Art of War, ‘Being prepared for all
  circumstances is what ensures certain victory.’


  “…insights, defined as penetrating truths that you never knew existed and
  which through intuitive understanding and immediate action allow you to gain a
  superior advantage.”


  Establishing channels for gathering business intelligence is not just a matter
  of setting up a few Google Alerts, although it can start there. It requires a
  detailed implementation plan, from analyzing your current state to tracking
  against specific metrics and outcomes.


  Once you have the data, it can allow you to make critical changes if you know
  how to use it.

  ### Intelligence + Decision-Making = Advantage


  > "Whether it’s business or whether it’s war, you have to generate better
  information than your rivals do, analyze that information and move quickly to
  turn strategic choices into decisive action."- Wake Up or Die, page 22


  Data, like ideas, is worthless unless change can be created from it. Knowing
  how to analyze your data is one thing, but being able to successfully initiate
  and implement change in your organization goes along with it. Sandler
  emphasizes the need to build decision-making processes to allow you to take
  advantage of new information and create new solutions ahead of your
  competitors.


  Data can also be used as an early warning system, allowing you to anticipate
  where issues occur before they become overwhelming. As Sandler notes, “a
  resilient company anticipates crisis and objectively determines what the
  consequences might be.” **In our world of disruptive change, resilience is a
  key competency for survival and success.**


  I have increased the use of analytics with my clients over the past few years,
  and while I can safely say I have never evoked war terminology in my work, I
  really connected with Sandler’s passion for data intelligence, and the
  higher-level thinking and outcomes it brings to your work. _Wake Up or Die_
  will help you build the strategies you need to incorporate data intelligence
  and go boldly forward to conquer the business world. Harnessing data and using
  it to solve problems and set new directions will give you a strong competitive
  advantage over your enemies on the corporate battlefield.

  ### Use Data To Rethink Everything


  > "If you want to change the way a company acts, you have to begin with
  changing how it thinks."- Wake Up or Die, page 37


  Sandler outlines several models for using business intelligence to rethink how
  you compete successfully, and provides great examples, from Kimberly-Clark to
  the US Army, of businesses that have made significant operational changes
  through the use of market intelligence. The solution isn’t just about pulling
  data from various sources, but integrating it into your strategies and project
  plans effectively.


  Sandler also notes that a different form of leadership is also needed, one
  that allows employees to run with ideas. It requires being open to new
  possibilities and allowing employees to change existing approaches in pursuit
  of new ones if business intelligence is providing the signals. She encourages
  leaders to **allow employees to explore opportunities through “blue sky”
  sessions and encourage them to rethink the status quo.** Using data
  intelligence as a springboard for creativity can be a continual source of
  inspiration.


  Once you have the intelligence and ideas you need though, you still need to
  take action.

> "In the life and death quest for strategic change businesses have much to learn from war." _\- Wake Up or Die, page 131_

Big data is a hot topic these days, which makes Corrine Sandler’s book, _Wake Up or Die_, very timely. Using military leadership theories from Sun Tzu’s _The Art of War_, Sandler outlines why the use of data as intelligence in organizations is critical and guides us through the strategies and tactics for embedding analytics deeply into your organization. You might have already started down the big data path, but **knowing how to use data as business intelligence for making decisions and changes can give you a powerful market advantage.** Sandler tells us what we need to do in the war-like battle for market domination.

The volume of data we generate – 2.5 quintillion bytes of data per day, according to Sandler – makes this a daunting challenge. But it means the answers are there if you know how to find them, what to do with the information you gain, and you have a willingness to make the change needed to use the data to your advantage.

According to Sandler, “data needs to be incorporated into business processes with great care in order to properly lead business operations onto the path of achieving their individual strategic objectives.”

Let’s start by talking about why data gives you the competitive advantage you need.
