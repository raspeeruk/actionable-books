  ### The Era of Empathy: The X Factor in Sales


  > "The belief that you understand and acknowledge a person – that you not only
  viscerally understand but care about that person within the context of your
  business interaction – already exists almost without your trying."- What Got
  You Here, page 27


  From birth, “we naturally connect with others both emotionally and
  physiologically and usually do so without trying.” It’s in our nature to
  connect with others, to experience their feelings, even physically, and to
  care. In contrast, a career in sales requires a strong ego and the ability to
  persuade and convince others. **The challenge in our new era is to balance
  this powerful ego with empathy, which fosters connection and caring.**


  The authors outline sixteen habits that impair our ability to connect with our
  customers in meaningful, empathic ways. And they’re habits our customers are
  desperate for us to break:


  *   Failure to Be Present

  *   Vocal Filler

  *   Selling Past the Close

  *   Selective Hearing

  *   Contact without Purpose

  *   Curb Qualifying

  *   Using Tension as a Tool

  *   One-Upping

  *   Overfamiliarity

  *   Withholding Passion and Energy

  *   Explaining Failure

  *   Never Having to Say You’re Sorry

  *   Throwing Others under the Bus

  *   Propagandizing

  *   Wasting Energy

  *   Obsessing over the Numbers


  _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There in Sales!_ dissects these habits and
  how they affect our ability to sell. We then learn how to identify one habit
  and break it – by stopping the behavior and engaging in follow-up coaching.

  ### Getting Help, Getting Ideas, Getting There


  > "Behavioral change is not something you do alone. It requires two people:
  one to change and one to notice it."- What Got You Here, page 137


  Perhaps the most difficult challenge to affecting meaningful change is the
  need for accountability. And it’s often at this point where we resist change –
  **successful people especially fear the embarrassment and vulnerability of
  asking for and accepting help with personal improvement.** An outside
  stakeholder, however, provides the ability to be on the outside looking in,
  offering feedback and suggestions, and cheering you on. The key here is
  selecting a trusted individual who you won’t want to disappoint and who will
  want to see you succeed.


  The authors go on to outline the Feed_Forward_ method of soliciting and
  accepting suggestions for improvement. Outline what you’d like to change,
  request two ideas for making that positive change, listen silently, then say
  thank you. With this quick, future-focused, judgment-free script, Goldsmith,
  Brown and Hawking provide a way to help successful people become who they want
  to be.  

  The most valuable portion of this book, for me, was the focus on and
  importance of follow-up with the chosen stakeholder(s). Most, if not all,
  professional salespeople have been subjected to a wide variety of sales
  training and sales methodology, usually a once-a-year event. We’re given our
  marching orders and sent back to the field, where everything we learned and
  planned to change is quickly forgotten in the course of our busy work lives.
  But behavioral science shows that follow-up coaching is the connection between
  training and performance improvement.


  Asking for input and ideas to change just one habit, accepting those
  suggestions without rebuttal, and then following-up later provides a powerful
  means of coaching that is non-confrontational and helps to ease the
  vulnerability of making meaningful change. It’s also nice to have
  encouragement and support on this journey.


  What about you? Do any of the sixteen habits resonate? What would you like to
  change or improve? Is there someone you trust as a coach and encourager?

  ### The Rules of Change Are Different for Successful Salespeople


  > "The first step in change for successful individuals is to own it, to
  recognize that the issue isn’t about the customer, the market, or even the
  product – it is about you. Second, you have to want to change."- What Got You
  Here, page 127


  **A personal desire for change is the single best indicator for success in
  changing any of the sixteen habits.** But successful people, in particular,
  have challenges in self-selecting for personal change. As the authors note,
  “‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ doesn’t apply to helping successful people
  change.” The very nature of being successful in their careers, may lead
  salespeople to avoid change.


  It then comes down to the Natural Law – people will only change if it is in
  their own best interest (as defined by their values) to change. **And for
  salespeople in particular, there are four factors that inspire change:
  _money_, _power_, _status_, and _relationships_**. Determining which factor
  means the most to you provides the necessary motive to change.

_What Got You Here Won’t Get You There in Sales!,_ by Marshall Goldsmith, Don Brown, and Bill Hawkins, outline the sales habits your customers want you to give up and the methodology to create lasting change. The authors detail the changing nature of the customer-salesperson relationship, identifying empathy (emotional intelligence) as the new key differentiator in sales.

As they dissect the nature of modern communication and the ways technology has changed our interpersonal interactions, the authors advocate for a return of connection in our business and personal relationships. Beyond the accepted schools of thought (Solution Selling, Relationship Selling, and others), Goldsmith, Brown, and Hawkins have created a sales methodology for our generation.
