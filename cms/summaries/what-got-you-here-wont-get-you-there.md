  ### The Power of Gratitude


  > "Thanking works because it expresses one of our most basic emotions:
  gratitude. Gratitude is not an abstraction. It is a genuine emotion, which
  cannot be expected or exacted. You either feel it or you don’t. But when
  someone does something nice for you, they expect gratitude – and they think
  less of you for withholding it."- What Got You Here Won’t Get You There, page
  157


  One of the 20 habits that could be holding you back from getting to the next
  level in your professional life and your interpersonal interactions is the
  failure to express gratitude. Goldsmith talks about how showing gratitude
  gives our interpersonal interactions closure and how the simple words “thank
  you” can have a huge impact on our professional and personal relationships and
  how others view us.


  Seems simple, right? Say thank you more and let others know they are
  appreciated. But sadly a lot of people who have the potential to become great
  leaders are lacking this interpersonal skill that would help to take them to
  the next level of leadership.


  Recognition is the first step. Is this as an area that you could improve upon?
  If it is, it’s important to hold yourself accountable. One key thought from
  the book that stuck with me was this sense of accountability for a particular
  habit we want to change. When you hold yourself accountable or ask for a
  colleague or a loved one to hold you accountable you will make leaps and
  bounds into improving upon the behaviour you wish to change.

  ### Make a conscious effort to give recognition where it is due


  > "But there is a difference between being an achiever and a leader.
  Successful people become great leaders when they learn to shift the focus from
  themselves to others."- What Got You Here Won’t Get You There, page 72


  Shift your focus to look at those around you who helped you achieve your
  success. Think in the last week, the last month or the last year of the people
  who helped you get to where you are today and make a list. Then practice the
  art of gratitude and give them recognition for the part they have played in
  your success. A small note of thanks goes a long way.

  ### Just say “Thank you”


  > "Has this ever happened to you? You are at a party. It doesn’t matter if you
  are a man or a woman. You see a female neighbor wearing a stunning dress. You
  tell her, ‘You look great, Barbara. That’s a gorgeous dress.’ Instead of
  saying thank you, she turns into a flustered schoolgirl. ‘Oh this old thing?’
  she says. ‘It’s just some rag I found in the closet.’ You tune out… Of course
  she doesn’t mean it harshly. But that’s the chilling effect of not saying
  thank you. You create a problem where none should exist."- What Got You Here
  Won’t Get You There, page 89


  Two simple words can make all the difference in maintaining strong
  interpersonal relationships with colleagues, loved ones and those we encounter
  as we move through life: thank you.


  Hold yourself accountable. Stop before you speak and ask yourself: is what I’m
  saying going to add any value to this conversation? Is what I am about to say
  going to hurt the other person? We all need to learn to express gratitude and
  allow ourselves to receive compliments we are paid. Just say thank you!
f_conclusion: >-
  Marshall Goldsmith’s _What Got You Here Won’t Get You There_ is a wealth of
  knowledge that will help anyone who wants to become a truly great leader and
  change bad leadership habits that we can all fall victim to. His insights will
  help you to pinpoint the interpersonal habits that may be holding you back
  from reaching your full potential. This knowledge is delivered in an easy to
  read and apply format with lots of real world examples from his experience as
  an executive coach. We all have room for improvement. How do you plan to
  challenge yourself, to push yourself outside of your comfort zone of daily
  interactions? Instead of staying settled in our ways that have brought us to
  where we are now, this book begs the question of what deep seeded habits are
  you willing to change to push yourself to the next level if it meant you would
  become an inspiring and empowering leader?

  "There is a good chance that tomorrow is going to be just as crazy as today.
  If you want to change anything about yourself, the best time to start is now.
  Ask yourself, ‘What am I willing to change now?’ Just do that. That’s more
  than enough."

Changing long-standing behaviours can be a challenge for anyone.

Goldsmith brings together real world case examples and insights from his illustrious career as an executive coach. Over the past 50 years he has worked closely with CEO’s, budding young talent and executive teams in major companies around the world and has gathered together here some of the worst offenders in terms of workplace habits that are holding us back.
