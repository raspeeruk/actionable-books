  ### 7 Principles


  > "Your brand is the experience that is actually delivered and communicated
  through every single thing you do, every day, around the clock."- What Great
  Brands Do, page 220


  What is the one quality that ultimately separates all great brands from the
  rest? Denise calls it her eighth principle. “Great Brands Do Brand as
  Business.” In other words, what they tell the world about themselves is also
  how they behave. There is an alignment of words and actions.


  It can’t be delegated to a department. It must be driven and embraced company
  wide. How do you do that? Denise summarizes the many things needed to build a
  great brand into seven principles.


  1) **Start inside** – Culture change is the first step because it determines
  whether employees see their connection to the deeper meaning of the brand.


  2) **Avoid selling products** – Make emotional connections. People buy based
  on how the brand makes them feel, not on the logic of features and benefits
  alone. The people lining up for the latest iPhone seem like a perfect example
  of this.


  3) **Ignore trends** – Trends may work in the short term. But to create
  enduring resonance, anticipate the larger cultural movements.


  4) **Don’t chase customers** – Identify your best target customers and focus
  on the unique value you bring them.


  5) **Sweat the small stuff** – Organizational silos result in less than
  stellar customer experiences. Go to great lengths to close the gaps in the
  customer touch points with your brand.


  6) **Commit and stay committed** – Consciously forgo opportunities for
  short-term growth that are not consistent with your brand.


  7) **Never have to “give back”** – When you focus on creating value for all
  stakeholders and having an overall beneficial impact on the world you build
  ‘giving back’ into your business and do not then need to make side
  contributions.


  It’s not enough to do one or two. Do all seven if you want to build a great
  brand.

  ### Start inside


  > "One mark of a great brand is that even former employees remain proud to say
  they helped make the brand great."- What Great Brands Do, page 24


  The starting point for a company to strengthen its brand is through its
  culture or its people. It is the employees that will turn the brand promise
  into breakthrough customer experiences.


  I had the pleasure of interviewing Denise before her talk at Rotman’s School
  of Management in Toronto. My ah-ha came when we discussed a visual around this
  idea.


  Imagine one person or department shining a torch outwardly (eg. the director
  of patient centricity). Now imagine if that person turned around and shone
  that torch inwardly. Her torch sparks the torches of all the employees. Now
  together, they have an inferno!


  How can we turn that torch inwardly? We can think of it as moving our brand
  efforts from project based to personnel based.


  Do your people know what your brand promise is and what it means to them? If
  your people don’t understand your brand, how can they possibly communicate it
  to your customers? Here are three ideas Denise shares:


  1) **Define** – Help people identify what the brand stands for.


  2) **Educate** – Help people identify why their brand’s promise is important
  to them and how it can bring meaning to them.


  3) **Activate** – Share ways that they can live the brand. Empower them with
  tools to infuse the brand into their daily decisions and behaviors.


  And look at whether the following are brand focused (or in our example patient
  focused):


  1) Leadership language and messages


  2) Hiring criteria


  3) Training/coaching


  4) Bonus/award structures


  You may have other ideas. Please share them below.

  ### Brand as a GPS


  > "The traditional definition of a brand as a mere marketing asset needs to
  end – the sooner the better."- What Great Brands Do, page 11


  Putting your brand out to the world is a nice start and typically what most
  people do. Saying something about yourself is far easier than doing something
  about it. But imagine if you did. Imagine if you started living what you
  profess to the world.


  When companies move from using their brand as a symbol or a message to gain a
  competitive edge to using it as a strategic management tool to guide all
  decisions, they change.


  Because I work in the pharmaceutical industry, to understand this better, I
  imagined two pharmaceutical companies who both profess to be patient focused
  in their vision and mission statements (their outward expression of their
  brand). But internally:


  Leaders at pharmaceutical company A:


  *   invest in fresh new advertising to build awareness in their “patient
  centricity”

  *   assign a Director of Patient Centricity

  *   fund various programs for patients

  *   donate to projects their patients are interested in


  A year or two later a senior executive is overheard saying “We can’t afford to
  be patient centric anymore!”


  Leaders at pharmaceutical company B:


  *   use their vision and mission as a compass for all decisions

  *   embed patient centricity in their culture

  *   talk about health outcome goals for patients instead of sales goals

  *   teach their people how to get in touch with their ‘why’ and the difference
  they can make to patients

  *   coach their people to think first about how their actions can help the
  patient

  *   change their bonus structure to award patient outcomes, not dollar
  outcomes


  A year or two later, a senior executive is overheard saying “We’ve never seen
  such engagement in our people or our health care partners. We are serving more
  people than ever before and our dramatic profit increase is enabling us to
  serve even more patients!”


  Sadly, only an elite few are in tune with what company B is doing; in tune
  with what Denise is teaching. These elite use their brand vision as a driver
  for everything their company does rather than just a goodwill producer.
f_conclusion: >-
  Saying what you want people to think of you is easy. Doing the work to make it
  real is a much bigger project. Only a few are willing to put forth the effort
  to achieve this greatness. Will it be you? When assessing the seven principles
  above, which one(s) are you doing well and which one(s) do you need to work
  on? What’s stopping you? Greatness awaits.

> "When you can’t see any daylight between what you believe, what you practice, what you offer and what you say about yourself, you are doing what great brands do." _\- What Great Brands Do, page 20_

If you want to dramatically improve your company, the solution may be right under your nose – in your brand. The trouble is that average businesses use their brand as an outwardly facing symbol or a message. Denise Lee Yohn argues that only when their brand becomes who they are and the compass for all their decisions, can they change their game.

In _What Great Brands Do,_ Denise shares her exercises, tools and action steps that she’s used in her twenty-five years of consulting with dozens of Fortune 1000 brands. They are organized into seven chapters that describe the seven most distinctive principles of what great brands do (and don’t do!). When your company adopts all these principles, your brand will be transformed to greatness!
