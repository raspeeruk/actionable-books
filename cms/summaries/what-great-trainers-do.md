  ### The Power of Two


  > "Content and process are always present in a workshop and the quality of
  each greatly affects participants’ learning."- What Great Trainers Do, page 9


  When it comes to workshop content, many trainers are not given adequate time
  or resources by their own businesses to become experts in the content they
  will be teaching, nor are they supported in learning about or handling
  different kinds of group dynamics. This problem is extensive; Bolton and
  Bolton quote “more than a million people are given first-time responsibility
  for training….with little, if any preparation in even basic teaching methods”.


  Take a moment to think about your current training or presentation methods,
  and ask yourself this question: “Do I focus on content or process when I
  deliver workshops?”


  Well, according to the authors, even though the most successful trainers pay
  equal attention to both _Content_ and _Group Process_, often, when we have a
  lot of course material with multiple units, modules and components to cover
  off during a workshop, we tend to focus on the actual subject matter being
  taught – the ideas, approaches, systems and techniques being learned – while
  completely forgetting about observing and enhancing the group dynamic of the
  participants.


  So why is just concentrating on course _content_ an issue? Effective group
  process enables learning. Poor group dynamic undermines it.


  So learning and actively concentrating on generating effective group process
  within a training situation, while at the same time having the ability to fix
  disruptive and negative interactions from within the group are key attributes
  that will take you from being an average to a first-rate trainer.

  ### Are you delivering?


  > "A really good talk generally has been outlined, re-outlined, written,
  edited, tweaked, and perhaps honed some more…"- What Great Trainers Do, page
  71


  One of the key skills consistently used by dynamic trainers is their ability
  to fine-tune not only their presentations but also their delivery. According
  to the authors, “good delivery greatly enhances our (trainer) results”.


  They suggest making it a habit to deliver all presentations _extemporaneously_
  as opposed to giving an _impromptu_ presentation, because this will elevate us
  from being a mere trainer to a facilitator of content. Let me explain.


  To be clear, Bolton and Bolton differentiate the terms “impromptu” and
  “extemporaneously” in the following way. _Impromptu speaking_ implies
  presenting with little or no preparation or rehearsal, versus _extemporaneous
  delivery_ that is created through rigorous preparation and comprehensive
  run-throughs.


  Extemporaneous sounds time consuming, I know. But if there is one GEM, one
  improvement you can start today to set you apart as a trainer, start learning
  your subject matter thoroughly by reading, re-reading, editing, modifying it
  and so on. Why? Because once you have learned your course content inside out,
  you will be able to tailor the workshop for the groups you are working with,
  cut it back to fit condensed timeframes, illustrate your material with
  anecdotes and other relatable examples, or make it an interactive experience.


  English Poet John Dryden is quoted in the book as saying “you owe it the
  participants in your workshop to be a subject matter expert” while marketing
  guru Zig Ziglar comments “the more I knew about my subject, the more creative
  I could be in presentations.”


  Commit to knowing your material thoroughly and you will be prepared for the
  most unpredictable and challenging situation, while continuing to achieve the
  group learning goals of the workshop you set out to deliver.

  ### Debriefing Sessions


  > "The trainer’s ability to create a positive learning climate is one of the
  crucial factors for success in leading a workshop."- What Great Trainers Do,
  page 186


  The idea of debriefing to discuss key takeaways from business meetings,
  brainstorming sessions and planning discussions is common within the corporate
  context, yet rarely do presenters or trainers take the time to debrief
  material, learnings or participant doubts after workshops.


  In _What Good Trainers Do_, “debriefing” specifically refers to the idea of
  “after-the-fact review discussions”; that is, discussion designed to promote
  conversation about knowledge learned, individual responses or feelings towards
  your workshop content including activities, subject modules, practical
  application of concepts or other components of the training.


  Introducing (and practicing) debriefing in your workshops will add a
  surprisingly handy and effective training tool to your skill set; providing
  you feedback on your sessions while the experience is fresh in the groups’
  mind, enabling you to continue to refine your dynamic trainer _content_ and
  _group process_ based on collective learning.


  A good debriefing session has the added benefit of increasing levels of
  participation because it provides an opportunity for two-way communication
  between you the trainer, individuals, and the broader group, fostering an
  interactive environment.


  Here’s the six-step process from the book that will get you started in leading
  debriefing sessions today:


  1.  Make sure any smaller breakout groups are joined back to the larger group.
  This brings focus.

  2.  Pose a clear and relevant question to the whole group, and then wait
  patiently.

  3.  Keep silent even if it feels like an eternity. Give the group time to
  collect their thoughts and answers.

  4.  As participants provide input, listen carefully and acknowledge their
  statements with reflection such as “so your learning is”, or “so you noticed
  that”…. Avoid evaluation-type comments such as “good point”.

  5.  Invite other responses until everyone who wants to contribute has spoken.

  6.  Then, your debrief is complete. Transition to the next part of the
  workshop.


  Bolton and Bolton advocate encouraging as many participants as possible to
  participate in giving comment during your feedback session. Why? Because their
  training efforts have seen a high frequency of debrief contributors actually
  using what they have learned and discussed when the workshop is over.

> "Our simple attention, offered to another person, is the most underused of human resources, one of the least costly, one of the most freely available, and – without a doubt – one of the most powerfully beneficial" _\- What Great Trainers Do, page 95_

_What Great Trainers Do_ is “the ultimate guide to delivering engaging and effective learning”. It is unashamedly subject matter specific. It is a great read for anyone who presents, facilitates or delivers course-based learning and workshops wanting to grow and expand their skills.

For those with considerable presenting experience, this book also offers deeper instruction to expand and refine your existing skills, helping you become a _Dynamic Trainer_; someone who has mastered the fundamentals of training who also understands diverse group based interactions and participant learning effectiveness.

Based on the _Craft of Training_ workshops delivered and refined across three decades by the authors Robert Bolton and Dorothy Grover Bolton at a range of companies from not-for-profit to Fortune 500 corporations, the book details the challenges of training and being a trainer, explores the key ingredients for a good workshop and builds an actionable framework for training based on insights and examples gathered from their real-life training situations.
