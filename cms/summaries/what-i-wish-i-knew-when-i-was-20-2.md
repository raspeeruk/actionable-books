  ### The World Through Different Lenses


  > "We can challenge ourselves every single day. That is, we can choose to view
  the world through different lenses – lenses that allow us to see problems in a
  new light. The more we take on problems, the more confident and proficient we
  become at solving them. And the better we are able to see them as
  opportunities."- What I Wish I Knew When I was 20, page 16


  Most of us realize there are different ways of seeing the world – we all know
  people from different cultures or see the impact on our world of how other
  people think. However, most humans are very habitual in their thinking and
  actions. So much so that we find it extraordinarily difficult to gain a new
  perspective on anything. _What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20_ outlines specific
  tools and thinking skills that anyone can use to see their life in a new way
  and make changes for the better.

  ### Question the rules


  > "\[This book\] is designed to give you permission to question conventional
  wisdom and to revisit the rules around you. There will always be uncertainty
  at each turn, but armed with the confidence that comes from seeing how others
  have coped with similar ambiguities, the stress will morph into excitement,
  and the challenges you face will become opportunities."- What I Wish I Knew
  When I was 20, page 14


  Many of the choices we make are based on assumptions we have about life.
  Successful entrepreneurs question their assumptions as well as the
  conventional wisdom to seize opportunities. _“Guy Laliberté started Cirque du
  Soleil by challenging every assumption about what a circus could be and in
  doing so transformed a problem – a dying industry – into an opportunity.”
  (p25)_


  The following exercise from the book (p25) makes it easy for anyone to
  question their assumptions then use those assumptions to look at their
  problems from a new perspective.


  Make a list of all the assumptions you have about a particular problem – every
  aspect. Then turn these assumptions upside down by imagining the opposite of
  each one. Next, from both the original and upside-down assumptions, choose
  which ones you’d like to keep. What changes can you create to make those
  upside-down assumptions a reality? Some of them may be more realistic than you
  think.

  ### Inspiration through "recombining"


  > "Lucky people don't just pay attention to the world around them and meet
  interesting individuals – they also find unusual ways to use and recombine
  their knowledge and experiences."- What I Wish I Knew When I was 20, page 126


  Next time you have to generate solutions to a problem, use this exercise from
  the book (p19) to see the problem from a new perspective and brainstorm more
  solutions.


  Ask a friend to name a random object, the first thing that comes to their mind
  (don’t tell your friend what the problem is). Use that object to solve your
  problem. Come up with at least 10 solutions and write them all down. This
  gives you a chance to get into the flow of generating ideas and writing them
  down ensures you don’t forget any.


  The random object takes you out of your habitual frame of reference for
  solving that problem, forcing you to find other resources and points of view.

  _What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20_ literally changed my life – I started
  running a workshop based on the exercises and principles in the book. I even
  called the author and chatted to her on the phone after running my first
  workshop. She was as encouraging and high-energy as her book!

  "Knowing that you can question the rules is terrifically empowering. It is a
  reminder that the traditional path is only one option available to you. You
  can always follow a recipe, drive on the major thoroughfares, and walk in the
  footsteps of those before you. But there are boundless additional options to
  explore if you are willing to identify and challenge assumptions, and break
  free of the expectations that you and others project onto you."
