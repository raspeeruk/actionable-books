  ### Where’s the trust?


  > "As Baby Boomers pointed out years ago and Gen Xers reiterated, trust in
  leadership does not come simply from leaders having a higher-level role than
  those they supervise. The leaders have to continuously earn their direct
  reports’ trust."- What Millennials Want from Work, page 61


  According to the book’s research **only 38 percent of Millennials trust their
  boss a lot**. Organizational trust is even lower with only 24 percent of
  Millennials saying they trust their organization a lot. It’s a major concern
  for organizations when roughly two out of three Millennial employees have some
  level of hesitation about their organization’s or their leader’s
  trustworthiness.


  It’s not surprising that Millennials generally distrust organizations and
  leaders. Many Millennials entered the workforce during the Great Recession in
  which millions lost their jobs and homes. In the eyes of Millennials, the days
  when companies promised a comfortable retirement after 40 years of service are
  long gone. Millennials today view themselves more as “free agents” in the
  market – ready to go to the company that gives them the best opportunity and
  compensation.


  With that being said, if Millennials feel like they found the right fit with
  an organization that they trust, a leader that they respect, work that’s
  interesting, and a community of peers that they get along with, they’ll stick
  around. About half of Millennials want to spend the rest of their careers with
  their current organizations and just under 70 percent of American Millennials
  expect to work nine or more years at their current organizations.


  If building trust is the first step in attracting and retaining Millennials,
  how do you make that happen? Below are a few actionable strategies.

  ### Provide opportunities for mentorship


  > "Ninety-one percent of Millennials say they either have or want a
  mentor…While 73 percent of Millennials expect their supervisors to help, only
  57 percent report that their supervisors do."- What Millennials Want from
  Work, page 51-52


  As young, inexperienced professionals, Millennials have a lot to learn. For
  many of them, having the right manager can make a huge difference and
  according to the research, mentorship is an area that Millennials are very
  interested in.


  A couple of years ago I was hired onto a business development team at a global
  tech company. The average age of the employees in the department was around 26
  years old. One of the most useful programs they provided was a mentorship
  program in which they paired every new hire with an experienced peer. The
  mentors were chosen based on their tenure and success with the role. In the
  first few months on the job I would shadow my mentor, ask him questions,
  listen into his client calls, and even have him listen into my calls. My
  mentor pointed out other people on the team to learn from and introduced me to
  a variety of resources that I otherwise wouldn’t have known about. While my
  manager supported me with coaching conversations every week, the day-to-day
  mentorship helped my growth during the early stages. Overall, it was critical
  to my onboarding and success at the company.


  Mentorship programs add another benefit that Millennials want more of –
  frequent feedback. According to the authors, “while 54 percent of Millennials
  would like developmental feedback monthly or more frequently (daily or
  weekly), only 23 percent say they get feedback that frequently.” Exploring
  options for mentorship programs is a great way to train and empower
  Millennials. It complements the manager’s coaching conversations and a way for
  the mentors themselves to develop leadership and coaching skills themselves.

  ### Be fair and open about compensation


  > "Overall, a massive 99 percent of Millennials we studied believe that their
  compensation is at least somewhat important."- What Millennials Want from
  Work, page 82


  Millennials might be even more sensitive than previous generations about pay.
  Many of them are coming out of school with significant student loan debt as
  approximately 70 percent of BA graduates take out a student loan in the US.
  Many are dealing with sky rocketing living costs (especially in urban areas)
  and trying to save a few bucks for retirement. Studies also show that
  generations that entered the workforce during depressions earn less over the
  course of their careers putting Millennials deeper in the hole.


  Companies that have an unfair or unclear compensation system will have a
  difficult time attracting Millennials. In the last few years, websites like
  [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm) have been curating anonymous
  company reviews and salary information from current and former employees
  making it very easy to find out how much others make. If a Millennial feels
  underpaid, it’s easy for them to find out and collect enough information to
  make the move to another company.


  Companies like Buffer are setting up [Transparency
  Boards](https://buffer.com/transparency) which make public the salaries of all
  the employees in the organization. If we’re talking about building trust with
  your employees, creating transparency and dialogue around salary could be a
  great first step. Most Millennials believe hierarchy is important so they
  won’t object to someone getting paid more because they have more
  responsibilities.


  According to the authors, “organizations shouldn’t try to hide or skew where
  the compensation sits in the distribution board, because Millennials are
  likely to find out.” Millennials want to know if they are being paid
  equitably. While setting up a Transparency Board a la Buffer might sound
  ambitious for your organization, be aware that the lack of transparency in
  compensation structure is a huge turn off for Millennials and making sure the
  current structure is understood becomes a critical aspect of retaining this
  generation.

  If you lead Millennials in your organization or are curious to find out how
  this will change the workplace, _What Millennials Want from Work_ is a
  well-researched, data-driven resource for you. My only wish from this book was
  to see some research on Millennials in startups and small businesses as they
  may have a different take on the world of work compared to their corporate
  peers. That aside, it was an enlightening look into the world of Millennials
  and how they’re set to continue to change our workplace.

  "Our research revealed that, fundamentally, Millennials want what older
  generations have always wanted: an interesting job that pays well, where they
  work with people they like and trust, have access to development and the
  opportunity to advance, are shown appreciation on a regular basis, and don’t
  have to leave."

> "Our research revealed that, fundamentally, Millennials want what older generations have always wanted: an interesting job that pays well, where they work with people they like and trust, have access to development and the opportunity to advance, are shown appreciation on a regular basis, and don’t have to leave." _\- What Millennials Want from Work, page 9_

_What Millennials Want from Work_ is a well-researched, data-driven look at Millennials in the workforce. The authors, Jennifer Deal and Alec Levenson, compiled and analyzed just under 25,000 surveys from Millennial-aged respondents across 22 countries. The respondents came from 300 organizations ranging from medium to large businesses. It may be the best researched book on Millennials that I’ve come across.

Millennials are often portrayed in the media as self (or selfie) obsessed slackers with a serious entitlement problem, but the research shows that they’re surprisingly similar to other generations. Here are a few interesting findings from the book’s research:

_“More than three-quarters of Millennials believe that hierarchies are useful.”_

_“When the conversation is about something Millennials believe is important to them (their performance, their career, or their compensation), they really want the conversation to happen face-to-face.”_

_“…about half say they would be happy to spend the rest of their careers with their current organizations.”_

Millennials may be the most tech savvy generation we’ve ever had but the findings above suggest that they’re more traditional than we expected. They believe in hierarchies, they want to have in-person conversations for things that are important to them, and many of them want to stay at their current organizations for a long time.

On the flip side, Millennials are also building upon the progress made by Baby Boomers and Gen Xers in the workplace. They are engaging in conversations to push the boundaries in workplace flexibility, pay equality, and transparency from their organizations. Millennials, like the generations before them, are continuing the generational tradition of pushing organizations to change.

If you lead Millennials in your organization, you need to pick up this book to better understand the generation that is soon to take over the workplace. In the sections below, I’ll share more of the research from the book and how to better engage this generation.
