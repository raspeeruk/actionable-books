  ### The Presenter’s Paradox


  > "When making an offer, communicators intuitively think more is better. They
  consider each item as a single add-on component, increasing the value of the
  whole offer or message…But listeners don’t look at the situation in the same
  way. Instead they ‘average’ all the pieces of information they hear and walk
  away with a single impression."- What More Can I Say?, page 83


  The Presenter’s Paradox was a big lightbulb moment for me. Research has shown
  that _we perceive situations, value and penalties quite differently –
  depending on whether we’re_ **_communicating_** _them or_ **_hearing_**
  _them._ When Booher illustrated this paradox for me using several different
  scenarios and examples, I immediately realized I often fall victim to the
  ‘more is better’ mentality when I am the communicator yet prefer the ‘less is
  better’ approach when I’m on the receiving end of similar information.


  Once you are consciously aware of the paradox, it is easy to spot. Spend a
  mere 10 minutes on The Shopping Channel and you will instantly see, hear and
  feel the lunacy of the over-sell! And yet, it is surprisingly easy to forget
  the needs of the listener when we are in ‘presenter’ mode. It is human nature
  to want to impress our audience with every feature and advantage associated
  with our brilliant idea or service, not recognizing that we are inadvertently
  undermining ourselves. The Presenter’s Paradox warns us that more is _not_
  better; more can actually be harmful!


  Now that you are aware of this counterintuitive principle, how can you use
  this knowledge to your advantage? My two Insights have been selected to help
  you do just that!

  ### Plug In to Power On


  > "You can’t persuade people to change their minds or their actions if you
  don’t know what they’re thinking or doing."- What More Can I Say?, page 137


  We’ve all heard the adage “Knowledge is Power” and yet in our haste to push
  our messages out, we often fail to gather the information we need to ensure
  those messages resonate with our intended audiences. Booher notes there is a
  big difference in the way successful negotiators and unsuccessful persuaders
  prepare for and participate in conversations. Essentially it boils down to
  asking a lot of questions and listening deeply to the answers so you can truly
  understand where the other person is coming from. The more you know about your
  customers, your supervisor, and your significant other, the greater your
  chances of framing your message in a way that will shift their opinions or
  behaviours in your favour.


  Strategies you can use to become a more influential communicator include:


  *   Asking probing questions to understand the other person’s goals, needs,
  concerns, and resistance

  *   Listening for areas of agreement and alignment (not areas of disagreement)

  *   Using expressive body language (eye contact, facial expressions, open body
  posture)

  *   Listening to the complete thought or point being made and then asking
  questions to clarify instead of interrupting and jumping to conclusions


  As Booher reminds us, _Listening and connecting provide the only way to close
  the gap between perception and reality._ Effective communicators do their
  homework to ensure they understand the intellectual, emotional and behavioural
  needs and biases of the group they want to influence. Then they use that
  knowledge to shape their message and create a win-win outcome for all.

  ### Add by Subtracting (Less = More)


  > "Over-choice paralyzes people. While they initially feel motivated by the
  thought of extensive personal choice, having fewer options makes it easier for
  people to decide, buy or do something."- What More Can I Say?, page 44


  Yes, we all love the idea of choice until we are overwhelmed by a tsunami of
  options: 100 cable TV channels, 50 flavours of ice cream, 10 page dinner
  menus, 35 shades of green paint. Who hasn’t stood in line in a stupor of
  indecision vacillating between several equally attractive yet slightly
  different possibilities? It takes time and mental energy to process all those
  alternatives and feel we are making the ‘right’ decision. We can be far more
  decisive when there are a limited number of well-articulated and distinct
  choices.


  Astute communicators seeking to persuade or influence the decisions of others
  work hard at giving them a well-curated short-list of key benefits; ones that
  are truly value-added and meaningful. They focus on the one, two or three
  ‘must have’ pieces of information to facilitate positive decision-making and
  buy-in and resist the urge to sweeten the deal with low value ‘bonuses’.


  So, the next time you need to pitch an idea, apply for a job, or launch a new
  marketing campaign, remember to put yourself in the shoes of the
  listener/receiver. Employ the less is more approach by subtracting low-value
  extras so that your primary selling points add impact and produce your desired
  outcome.

  _What More Can I Say?_ packs a lot of wisdom and practical examples into its
  146 pages. The tone is conversational and the information easy to digest. If
  you want to refine your communication skills and become more effective in
  motivating others to take action, buy your product or service, or offer you
  your dream job, this book will greatly improve your chances of success.

> "All the raw ingredients of communication (words, body language, emotion, logic, action, inaction, listening, branding, perception, structure, and so forth) produce change – either positive or negative." _\- What More Can I Say?, page xv_

The irony of struggling to find a suitably engaging opening line for this summary on Dianna Booher’s book _What More Can I Say?_ is not lost on me! Indeed, it is one of the reasons I picked up her book in the first place – a desire to add some additional techniques to my communication toolkit so I can be more effective in both my business and personal conversations.

The book is organized according to nine core principles of persuasive communication – presented as ‘laws’ – and offers concrete suggestions for overcoming common communication gaffes so you can achieve the positive outcomes you desire. I particularly liked the nuggets of wisdom contained in the Laws of Simplicity vs. Complexity, Distinction vs. Dilution and Emotion vs. Logic.
