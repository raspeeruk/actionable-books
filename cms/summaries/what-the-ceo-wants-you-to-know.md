  ### Every Business Is the Same Inside


  > "Think like a street vendor"- What the CEO Wants You to Know, page 29


  Ram Charan preaches simplicity hard and heavy throughout the book and
  constantly challenges us to think about business like a street vendor. So
  often we as business professionals get so bogged down in our formal
  educations, the size of our companies, and the challenges which face with our
  customers, that it’s easy to understand how the majority of people don’t
  fundamentally understand how their business operates. In order to change that
  we need to focus on understanding the five essential elements of business
  which are: Cash, Margin, Velocity, Growth and Customers.


  As Charan writes: “Everything about a business emanates from this nucleus.”
  Here is what we’re talking about when mentioning these five terms:


  *   **Cash** – How it’s generated and why it’s critical.

  *   **Margin** – The importance of making money and being profitable.

  *   **Velocity** – The process through which you turn inventory or capital.

  *   **Growth** – What creates growth and why.

  *   **Customers** – The simple reasons they buy from some businesses and not
  from others.


  Think like a street vendor! If you can examine your business and how it
  operates in these five basic areas, “you are on your way to thinking and
  acting like a true businessperson and a successful CEO”.

  ### Learning From the Street Vendor


  > "Running a one-person business may seem simple, but it requires many
  decisions."- What the CEO Wants You to Know, page 26


  There is a lot we can learn by viewing our business like a street vendor.
  Being a street vendor requires one to know every aspect of the business:
  product, sales, customers, competitors, profit margin, return on assets,
  inventory velocity, etc.


  In most large businesses today, we are slotted into specific roles and job
  functions which limit our broad view of how our organization holistically
  operates. While it might not be our job yet to have to know all of that, being
  able to understand these building blocks of business will help to position the
  trajectory of our careers.

  ### Rekindling the Spirit of the Lemonade Stand

  ones your company faces."- What the CEO Wants You to Know, page 131


  Most would agree that leaders must have strong business acumen to lead and to
  grow their businesses, especially at the top. We also know that becoming a
  senior leader with that level of capability and experience doesn’t happened
  overnight, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start today.


  Charan challenges the reader to linking your own priorities and job function
  to the bigger organizational picture. By doing so, “Your perspective will
  expand beyond your functional or departmental view to a total business view.”
  As your perspective changes and grows, your thinking will grow and you’ll be
  able to take the lead in your team in relating business decisions to the
  universal laws of business. To start, try to find out the answer to the
  following questions:


  *   What were your company’s sales during the last year?

  *   Are sales growing, declining, or flat? What do you think about this growth
  picture?

  *   What is your company’s profit margin? Is it growing, declining, or flat?

  *   How does your margin compare with your competitors?

  *   How does it compare with those of other industries?

  *   Do you know your company’s inventory velocity? It’s asset velocity?

  *   What is your company’s return on assets?

  *   Is your company’s cash generation increasing or decreasing? Why is it
  going one way or the other?

  *   Is your company gaining or losing against the competition?


  As you take a step back and a more clear overall sense of your business ask
  yourself: What questions do I have as a result of this information? Are there
  any answers that are unclear to me? If so, ask a colleague, boss or
  organizational leader. This is another step in building your business acumen
  and positioning yourself for a future leadership position.

  "The one thing I’ve noticed is that the best CEO’s—the one’s whose companies
  make money year after year—are like the best teacher you ever had. They are
  able to take the complexity and mystery out of business by focusing on the
  core fundamentals."

Business acumen is one of the most commonly used buzz words in organizations today. It is a characteristic that seemingly all businesses want in their leaders, yet, why is it such a rare quality to find? When you further examine what business acumen is, it’s a type of business savvy that one could compare to street smarts. In his book _What The CEO Wants You To Know_, esteemed author Ram Charan examines the basic building blocks of business (Cash, Margin, Velocity, Growth and Customers) and how the world’s best leaders are able to simplify complex business down these simple building blocks.

Charan learned valuable business lessons as a child working at his family’s shoe shop. The simplicity of his experiences growing up, coupled with the work he does today (senior advisor to CEO’s and Senior Executives, author, former professor at Harvard and Northwestern) helps paint a clear, understandable picture for the reader to understand.

_What The CEO Wants You to Know_ is a short read that will help business professionals—from the C-suite to the mail room—understand that underneath it all, business is basic, simple and adheres to universal fundamentals.
