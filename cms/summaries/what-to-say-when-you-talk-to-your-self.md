  ### Good Self-Talk is your foundation


  > "Your own Self-Talk to your own inner self is, and always will be, your
  surest form of inner defense and inner strength."- What to Say When You Talk
  to Your Self, page 107


  Helmstetter’s book was written in 1982 and relies on terminology that existed
  back in the 60s and 70s when he was conducting his research around behavioural
  change. So some of his references are a little outdated – i.e. comparing a
  computer memory to a “floppy disk” (remember those?) But his examples and
  parallels still ring true. **He describes the human brain as a computer.** The
  way a computer is programmed affects the output that it produces. If a
  computer is programmed with flawed commands, then it will produce flawed
  results. The “coding” of the computer is what determines the limits of the
  computer.


  If you were raised in a reasonably positive family, on average you would be
  told “No” about 148,000 times. For those that were not as lucky to live in
  such a home, you may have heard more than 200,000 “no’s”. Year after year, our
  mental scripts – our coding – was being etched through this negative
  reinforcement and we slowly began to believe that programming.


  When we have such a powerful program already installed in our systems, it
  becomes clear why our well intentioned self-help efforts go awry. Our current
  “negative” programming overrides our system from installing something new. New
  ideas on how to make a positive change in our lives don’t get the traction
  that they need or get pushed aside by more urgent priorities.


  So how do you go about changing your programming? It all starts with Self-Talk
  and changing the way your brain is currently wired.

  ### Create Self-Talk recordings


  > "Tape-Talk – Self-Talk on tape – is without a doubt one of the more
  practical tools for the betterment of mankind, for the betterment of each of
  us individually, than any other self-development tool I have ever
  encountered."- What to Say When You Talk to Your Self, page 134


  One of the easiest ways to incorporate Self-Talk in your life is to create a
  Self-Talk recording. Access to a Self-Talk tape that addresses a challenge
  that you’re facing – whether it be to get yourself up when things are down or
  building your self-esteem – can make a big difference. **The importance here
  is not just that you create a recording but that you carefully choose the
  words to put into the recording.** Helmstetter incorporates a variety of
  Self-Talk recordings that you can pick up and start using immediately. Of
  course you can purchase these recordings but the best recordings are made when
  you record yourself reading these scripts. Here’s a quick example of a
  Self-Talk script for the “Freedom from Worry”.


  _I do not worry. I am in control of my own thinking and I think only those
  thoughts which create and fulfill the best in me._


  _My mind is constantly in tune with the positive. It is bright, cheerful,
  enthusiastic, and full of good, positive thoughts and ideas._


  _I am able to relax easily and comfortably in my body and in my mind. I am
  calm, confident, and self-assured._


  There’s more to this script but you get the idea. Note that the words that are
  carefully chosen here are all affirmations. “I do not” or “I am” put this
  recording in the present tense and describes who you are right now – not who
  you will be. Your brain, much like a computer, will accept the commands you
  enter and a Self-Talk recording can help ingrain the positive thoughts into
  your mind.

  ### Self-Talk changes your programming and your behaviour


  > "Self-Talk changes the picture – it changes the programming which creates
  the belief, which develops the attitude, which creates the feelings, which
  control the behaviour."- What to Say When You Talk to Your Self, page 142


  Our childhood, school, professional, and family lives have shaped the
  programming that we rely on to get through our lives. However, at a more
  surface level, what we experience on a day-to-day basis are our “feelings”
  that determine our behaviour. If you get a bad feeling about speaking up in a
  meeting, then your behaviour will probably result in silence. If you have a
  great feeling about asking your boss for a raise, your behaviour will likely
  reflect your feelings. Feelings play an important role in our life because
  they are the gut checks that we have before we take action. If your feelings
  consistently project a specific emotion to your brain, you will act
  accordingly with your feelings.


  **So if our feelings are so important – how do we change them?** Our behaviour
  is rooted in our feelings, our feelings are developed by our attitudes, our
  attitudes are created by our beliefs, and our beliefs come from our
  programming. If we can change our fundamental programming, we can change our
  behaviour.


  This is where Self-Talk can be helpful. Our programming is developed by what
  we are told and what we tell ourselves. If Self-Talk is employed in a
  repetitive way, you can _make your brain believe_ what you are saying. Imagine
  replacing the negative Self-Talk – “I wish I had more time” to “_I make time
  and take time to do what I need to do. I am responsible for choosing when,
  where, and how I spend my time. And I choose to spend my time in a way that
  creates the greatest benefits in my life_.” **That’s a powerful transition and
  your brain will believe it.**
f_conclusion: >-
  Self-Talk has been around for a while and I’m sure some people will be
  skeptical with the power that it can have in their lives. I was skeptical as
  well but after recording a few Self-Talk scripts from the book and listening
  to them in the morning, I actually felt like I was the person that I heard
  myself talking about. So often we get lost in our ocean of thoughts but
  Self-Talk allows you to cut past the negative and apathetic thoughts to bring
  out the best in you. If you’re taking self-improvement seriously, start with
  Self-Talk. It will be the foundation for you to build your continuous
  self-improvement projects and will impact all aspects of your life.
  Helmstetter’s book is a great start and more resources are available on the
  web. Happy Self-Talking!

> "Your success or failure in anything, large or small, will depend on your programming – what you accept from others, and what you say when you talk to yourself." _\- What to Say When You Talk to Your Self, page 25_

If there are so many “keys” to success being offered by self-help books, motivational speakers, and YouTube videos, why do many of them fail to deliver the results? And for the many great ideas that have worked for people, why does the impact only last for a few days or weeks? Shad Helmstetter, in his 1982 classic _What to Say When You Talk to Your Self_, believes that **the missing ingredient in successful change lies within yourself.**

There are many fantastic self-help strategies and tactics that can make a meaningful impact on your life. But if the programming within ourselves is not programmed correctly, our well thought-out and well intentioned actions can be derailed. Helmstetter believes that our programming can be corrected by something called “Self-Talk” – literally, what you tell yourself when you talk to yourself. **With improved Self-Talk, you can learn to adjust your programming** **and be able to rely on yourself to optimize your outlook and build true, inner-confidence.**
