  ### The Self-Management Sequence


  > "You will become what you think about most."- What to Say When You Talk to
  Yourself, page 25


  Citing typical phrases from decades of self-development literature – like
  _Believe in Yourself_ and _Create Your Future_ – Helmstetter points out the
  problems with positive thinking and motivational speaking. Three key
  ingredients are missing: a) permanence (all external solutions are temporary
  whereas only internal motivation lasts); b) knowledge of the brain’s actual
  physiological processes; and c) new word-for-word directions (a specific
  “programming vocabulary” to erase and replace old negative programming).


  Every moment our sub-conscious mind works to make sure we become precisely the
  person we’ve bought into. Stunningly, during the first 18 years of our lives,
  we’ve been told “no” about 148,000 times. Here’s the cause-and-effect chain
  reaction that results:


  1.  Programming creates beliefs.

  2.  Beliefs create attitudes.

  3.  Attitudes create feelings.

  4.  Feelings determine actions.


  Actions create results.

  ### Your Mental Apartment


  > "Our thoughts are the gold coins in the treasure chest of our inheritance."-
  What to Say When You Talk to Yourself, page 221


  Here’s a visual you can summon any time you’re at risk of getting off the
  rails. Imagine a “mental apartment” – the place you live with your thoughts.
  It’s furnished with everything you think about yourself and the world around
  you. Much is hand-me-down.


  Now, let’s say we clear out everything, leaving the place empty and spotless.
  There’s not a negative thought, sofa, picture, book or chair in sight. A
  little while later, left with nothing but yourself and an empty apartment, you
  retrieve a rickety chair stored in the garage. Next, you haul in your old TV.
  Before you know it, your space is rearranged using your familiar decor! Akin
  to old programming, you’ve not essentially replaced anything.


  In a second scenario, imagine we entirely eliminate your old furnishings. We
  don’t even give them away; we get rid of them outright. After the shiny
  delivery truck departs, your fresh digs stand on the sturdy legs of
  self-assurance. What was once a place of tattered hopes and broken-down dreams
  is filled with the bright beginnings of an exciting new you.


  _That_ is how positive thinking should work. Otherwise, it remains merely
  wishful.

  ### Applying the Five Levels of Self-Talk


  > "Wanting to be a positive thinker isn’t enough…We are too busy fixing the
  train to realize that we are on the wrong track."- What to Say When You Talk
  to Yourself, pages 89 and 112


  If we want to manage ourselves in a better way, the first step is to change
  our programming. Levels 4 and 5 truly harness our untapped power:


  1.  **Negative Self-Acceptance.** _“I can’t…”_ (e.g., “I can’t lose weight.”)

  2.  **Recognition & Need to Change.** _“I need to… I should…”_ end with an
  unspoken “but”, which makes Level 2 dangerously ineffective.

  3.  **Decision to Change.** _“I never… I no longer…”_ (e.g., “I no longer
  smoke.”)

  4.  **The Better You.** _“I am…”_ You’re painting a new picture of yourself.

  5.  **Universal Affirmation.** _“It is…”_ – expressed as a statement of fact.


  The Five Levels of Self-Talk can be applied in countless situations:


  *   **Daily**. If we allow “details” like driving annoyances, standing in line
  or dealing with rain to upset us, we can change our attitude any moment we
  like.

  *   **Miscellaneous Contexts.** These encompass problem-solving, getting
  organized, “selling”, shifting over-used “carrot or stick” management
  approaches and more.

  *   **Specific Issues.** Who doesn’t wish they could save money? How about
  reframing tight finances as follows: _“I am good at earning what I need. Every
  month, without fail, I put something aside. Each week/month/year, I become
  financially secure.”_

  *   **Habit-Changing.** To move from worry to freedom, we can create and
  practice new language such as _“I choose to look at the world around me in the
  bright, healthy light of optimism and self-assurance.”_
f_conclusion: >-
  Through the simple yet revolutionary techniques of Self-Talk, we can knock
  down walls that have stood in our way until now. It’s honestly the difference
  between living with fulfillment and purpose, versus expending our years
  frustrated and incomplete, contained by the limitations of our own disbelief.

> "You are everything that is, your thoughts, your life, your dreams come true. You are everything you choose to be. You are as unlimited as the endless universe." _\- What to Say When You Talk to Yourself, page 13_

Did you know as much as 77% of what you tell yourself is counter-productive – or that up to 75% of all illnesses are self-induced? How vital would it then be to learn the right words to make your success permanent? Such is the fulfilled promise contained within _What to Say When You Talk to Yourself_ by acclaimed psychologist, Shad Helmstetter, Ph. D. Though published in 1982, this classic unequivocally stands the test of time, as the brain only now begins to offer up its secrets some 30 years later.
