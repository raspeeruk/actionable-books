  ### Potential Trumps Experience


  > "What matters most is what someone can do, not what they have done. Don’t
  let the past limit you or anyone around you."- What You Aren’t Seeing, page
  156


  Attention recruiters, HR professionals and hiring managers. You need to take
  this The Big Idea to heart. As a mom who witnessed the frustration of a recent
  grad trying to break into the job market, I can say without reservation (nor
  motherly bias) that this is true. Resumes chronicle work history and
  experience; they ask candidates to sell themselves on what they have done, not
  what they believe they are capable of doing. Many interview questions also
  delve into past performance rather than looking to the future. And yet, as Tom
  Garland (former president of Avis Budget Group North America) rightfully
  notes, “You have to keep in mind that you are hiring someone for a certain
  position, but you are also hiring that individual for the future.” So, what
  you really want to determine is whether a job applicant has the potential to
  grow with your company and contribute in new and different ways over time!


  You might be thinking, that sounds good in theory but it’s too risky for my
  organization. And yet, Herb’s company Caliper _helped over 4,000 ‘hard core’_
  _unemployed individuals move from welfare to work for the first time in their
  lives_ with a termination rate of under 3% after two years. That’s a pretty
  impressive endorsement of potential over experience. As for my son, who has
  untapped potential in abundance, he finally secured employment with a company
  that seems to value his passion for his field and is willing to train for the
  technical requirements. That’s a win-win situation bursting with potential!


  How might your over-reliance on proven experience be limiting your potential
  and that of those around you? Insights 1 & 2 may help you change your focus.

  ### What are You Practicing?


  > "Musicians have a saying that if you don’t practice for one day, you’ll
  notice. If you don’t practice for a second day, other musicians will notice.
  And if you don’t practice for a week, the audience will notice."- What You
  Aren’t Seeing, page 145


  I smiled when I read this quote and I don’t think you have to be a musician to
  appreciate the truth and wisdom contained within it. We’ve all used
  expressions that mirror these sentiments: “I feel a little rusty today”, “I’m
  having an off day” or “I guess I’m not firing on all cylinders”. Usually these
  statements pertain to something we haven’t done in a while, something we
  haven’t been practicing.


  Whether or not there’s any validity for the assertion that it takes roughly
  10,000 hours of practice to achieve mastery in a given field, I think we can
  all agree that there are no gains or improvements without practice. Athletes,
  master chefs and motivational speakers all spend an inordinate amount of time
  practicing both the fundamentals of their craft and executing those
  fundamentals in ways that simulate real life situations. Even children
  experience the benefits of additional practice time. If it works for them, it
  will work for you too!


  What skills do you need to practice regularly in order to take your competency
  and expertise to the next level? Are you doing everything you can to keep your
  skills in peak condition?

  ### Just a Little Better


  > "I understood that he meant that I had to be as good as I possibly could, to
  keep pushing, to keep trying, to keep stretching…to show them that I could
  surpass their expectations."- What You Aren’t Seeing, page 44-45


  In a world that often overvalues BHAGs (big hairy audacious goals), home runs,
  grand slams and overnight success stories (which never happen overnight), the
  simplicity of striving to be ‘just a little better’ may, at first glance,
  appear to be an excuse to hold back. One simply has to recall the power of
  compound interest to appreciate that striving to be ‘just a little better’
  each day will yield significant results over time. One more push-up, one more
  phone call, a little less talking and more listening, a 1% increase in sales
  completions. Incremental change is usually much easier to both embrace and
  sustain than an ‘all or nothing’ approach.


  The other lesson here is that you should focus on personal development and
  growth. You are trying to be **a better you**, not to beat the competition,
  outshine your team mates or out-perform another division in your organization.
  In athletic lingo, you are striving for a PB (a personal best).


  I think the intrinsic satisfaction that comes with improving your game and
  continually achieving PBs is ultimately more fulfilling than the fleeting
  glory that comes with besting an opponent at any one particular moment in
  time. And I believe it develops a resiliency that spills over into other areas
  of your life. Of course, PBs don’t happen simply because we embrace a
  philosophy of incremental change and small improvements. PBs happen because we
  devote time to practicing that skill.

  Herb Greenberg achieved some amazing things because of his unwavering belief
  in his own potential and the potential of those he sought to help. He focused
  on becoming the best person he could be by striving to be just a little bit
  better each day, and by practicing the skills he needed to succeed in his
  chosen field. Now it’s your turn.

> "At the end of the day, the more we can take in and give out positive messages, the more we will be able to believe in ourselves and in those around us." _\- What You Aren’t Seeing, page 62_

I love a well told inspirational story. I love to root for the unsung hero and imagine how I might tackle similar challenges. I love delving into the psychological backstory and reflecting on questions that challenge my complacency about who I am and what I stand for. If this sounds like you then you will love how Patrick Sweeney weaves all these elements together as he tells the story of Herb Greenberg, a highly successful teacher and entrepreneur, in _What You Aren’t Seeing: How Using Your Hidden Potential Can Help You Discover the Leader Within._

In Sweeney’s words, “This book was created to share insights from Herb’s inspiring story, with the goal of helping you realize your own leadership potential, uncover the potential of those around you, and see a new world of possibilities.” The book examines 18 different leadership traits including empathy, confidence, trust, resilience, courage, grit, persuasiveness, risk-taking and more, using Herb’s story to showcase those traits in action. It is masterfully written and totally engaging from the opening words of the preface through to the closing words of the conclusion.

He focused on becoming the best person he could be by striving to be just a little bit better each day, and by practicing the skills he needed to succeed in his chosen field. Now it’s your turn.

Pick one thing in your work or personal life where you want to excel and deliberately focus on being just ‘a little bit better’ each time you perform that task. Set aside some time every day to practice that skill. Identify one or two ways you can track your progress and celebrate the PBs you achieve along the way.

And, try to look beyond someone’s resume and what they’ve done thus far in their life (or job). Consider what untapped potential lies within them. You may just be surprised by _What You Aren’t Seeing!_

_When have you been surprised by someone’s potential?_
