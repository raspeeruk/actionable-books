  ### It doesn’t have to be Lonely at the Top


  > "It’s a complex world, and you will never know everything by yourself. If
  you are isolated from others, you will be far less likely to be able to
  recognize your blind spots."- What You Really Need to Lead, page 119


  While I’ve read extensively on leadership over the years and promoted the
  value of collective wisdom in my work as a facilitator and consultant, the
  repercussions of leadership isolation that Kaplan highlighted resonated
  strongly with me. We live in a complex, rapidly changing world and there are
  not enough hours in the day to keep up to speed on everything. This holds true
  for leaders in established organizations as well as freelancers, entrepreneurs
  and anyone who telecommutes on a regular basis. We are all susceptible to
  developing blind spots about a myriad of business metrics and our own
  performance.


  I particularly liked the questions Kaplan listed to help readers figure out if
  they were becoming isolated:


  *   Do you seek advice? Do you interview your people (or others in your
  industry)?

  *   Do you listen without interrupting? Do you think you have all the answers?

  *   Are most of your interactions by email, phone or in person?


  My answers to these questions were a wake-up call for me and maybe they are
  for you, too! I will definitely be making changes to ensure I stay connected
  with others more regularly with the goal of staying current on industry
  trends, best practices and identifying my pesky blind spots.

  ### Become a Transformer


  > "A leader that learns to cultivate others and be open to learning can more
  effectively fight through the natural isolation that leaders feel as they
  become more senior."- What You Really Need to Lead, page 57


  When my sons were growing up they loved toys known as Transformers.
  Transformers looked like ordinary racecars or animals, yet with a few simple
  adjustments magically morphed into robots with special powers. Individual
  Transformers could join together and create an unstoppable super robot. Have
  you figured out where I’m going with this analogy yet?


  Aspiring leaders need to adopt a transformer mindset to improve business
  outcomes and minimize their isolation. Look for opportunities to shift from
  doer to mentor, from someone who has all the answers to someone who has
  thoughtful questions. Acknowledge the unique superpowers of your team members
  and colleagues. Rally them around a common vision so you achieve more
  collectively than you could ever achieve individually. As the opening quote
  noted, _leadership is a team sport._ Winning teams learn together and work as
  one unit. Effective leaders know success is a team effort and act accordingly.

  ### Take the Road Less Travelled


  > "Thinking and acting like an owner involves learning to explore intellectual
  as well as emotional matters. It involves knowing what to pay attention to in
  the chaos of your work and life, and knowing how to better understand
  yourself."- What You Really Need to Lead, page 86


  Kaplan suggests _there are at least two leadership-related processes that we
  go through every day_, even though we may not be consciously aware of them.
  One pertains to how we align priorities with vision. That is, knowing our
  unique contributions to key endeavors and then focusing on the critical tasks
  that enable us to provide that value. The second, possibly more challenging
  process, focuses on developing one’s self-awareness and using those insights
  to develop as a leader. The latter process is _the road less travelled_.


  Kaplan points out that _your capacity to understand yourself has an impact on
  your ability to do your job._ If you are not willing to learn more about
  yourself, to reflect on why you do what you do (or why you don’t do what you
  should do), how can you possibly expect to excel at your job or inspire others
  to follow you? Life is not static and Kaplan suggests we put ourselves at
  increased risk for isolation and failure if we do not keep updating our
  understanding of ourselves. Once again, he suggests some strategies and
  questions worth considering:


  *   Why can’t I delegate? Why do I delegate too much?

  *   Why can’t I admit I made a mistake? Why do I need to assign blame?

  *   Why didn’t I speak up at the meeting? Why did I monopolize the
  conversation?

  *   Why was that decision so hard to make? Why can’t I change my mind?


  Regularly seeking honest feedback from others regarding your strengths and
  limitations is another way to enhance your self-awareness and eliminate your
  blind spots. If you are serious about developing your leadership capabilities,
  you must choose the road less travelled and spend time getting to know
  yourself better.
f_conclusion: >-
  _What You Really Need to Lead_ distinguishes itself from its competition in
  the ‘how to become a leader’ genre by highlighting the avoidable fallout that
  accompanies unaddressed blind spots – be they about business know-how or
  personal habits and behaviours – and providing helpful questions and exercises
  to help leaders at all levels minimize those blind spots. I was surprised to
  discover that some of my past leadership challenges and lackluster results, as
  well as more recent ones as a self-employed consultant, were likely the result
  of social isolation – trying to do too much alone. Armed with this insight, I
  am changing how I do a few things, including the simple acts of using the
  phone instead of email more often and scheduling meet-ups over coffee or
  lunch.

  "Leadership is a team sport. That is to say, your success is inextricably
  linked to the activities and contributions of others. You are highly unlikely
  to become a leader or develop your leadership capabilities all by yourself."

> "Leadership is a team sport. That is to say, your success is inextricably linked to the activities and contributions of others. You are highly unlikely to become a leader or develop your leadership capabilities all by yourself." _\- What You Really Need to Lead, page 17_

I have a long-held fascination with leadership and have read innumerable books on the topic. Clearly I am not alone, as a quick keyword search of the Actionable Books website generated a list of 135 summaries on books tagged for leadership, four workshops, two podcasts and at least eight blog posts! Search for ‘books on leadership’ on Google and you get 340,000,000 possible hits while Amazon.com generates 177,099 possibilities.

So, what could Harvard Business School professor Robert Steven Kaplan possibly say in _What You Really Need to Lead: The Power of Thinking and Acting like an Owner_ that hasn’t already been said? Like others before him, Kaplan believes leaders are made not born and that leadership is _a way of thinking and acting_ rather than positional power and control_._ He covers much of the same leadership territory that other authors in the genre have noted (i.e. commit to learning, ask questions, build relationships, develop teams) however he tackles these familiar topics using the lens of “ownership” to convey his key messages.

Kaplan emphasizes that becoming a leader is a lifelong journey and more importantly, that it is not something we can do alone. While we need to take ownership for our own growth and development and do our jobs with a stronger sense of ownership over the outcomes, our greatest leadership challenge is guarding against trying to go it alone.
