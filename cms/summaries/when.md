  ### Larks, Owls and Third Birds


  > "We are smarter, faster, dimmer, slower, more creative, and less creative in
  some parts of the day than others."- When, page 22


  We all experience the day in three stages – a peak, a trough and a rebound.
  About three-quarters of us (larks and third birds) experience it in that order
  and one in four people who are night owls, experience it in the reverse –
  recovery, trough, peak.


  People feel increasingly happy, warm toward others and enjoy themselves more
  increasingly throughout the morning, less warm in the afternoon and warmer
  again in the evening. Research has also shown that time-of-day effects can
  explain 20% of the variance in performance on cognitive undertakings. For
  example, students scored higher in the mornings than in the afternoons.


  How can you use this knowledge to your benefit?


  First, figure out your type:


  1.  What time do you usually go to sleep?

  2.  What time do you usually wake up?

  3.  What is the middle of these two times?


  If that numbers falls between 12am and 3am you are a Lark. If it’s between 6am
  and 12pm you are an Owl. Most people are not an Owl or a Lark but fall into
  the Third Bird category. If it’s between 3:30am – 5:30am you are a third bird.


  Now that you know your type, you can identify the peak hours you may want to
  protect for your most challenging work. Perhaps you will want to book that
  appointment with a tough customer for _their_ peak time.


  The trough is the tough time. You may not want to book your surgery (yikes!
  The stats are staggering) or take a test during this time. More creative
  endeavors may be better suited here. But you don’t always have a choice. We’ll
  talk more about what to do to protect yourself from the dangers of the trough
  in Gem #2.

  ### Afternoons and Coffeespoons


  > "You probably have a to-do list. Now it’s time to create a ‘break list’,
  give it equal attention and treat it with equal respect."- When, page 75


  I still felt guilty about it: the day, when, as a pharmaceutical sales rep, I
  pulled my car over mid-afternoon and (deep sigh) took a nap. But not anymore!


  The statistics Pink shares are staggering. Bottom line, the overall benefits
  of napping to our brain power, productivity, and overall health are massive.
  And breaks, contrary to popular belief that they are wasteful, actually
  contribute to our productivity in significant ways!


  For example: taking tests in the afternoon without a break produces scores
  that are equivalent to spending less time in school each year, and having
  parents with lower incomes and less education. But taking the same test after
  a twenty or thirty-minute break leads to scores that are equivalent to
  students spending three additional weeks in the classroom and having somewhat
  wealthier and better-educated parents. Whoa. That puts the proposal to cut
  recess out the window!


  By studying the most successful people in the world and sharing their secrets,
  Pink shows us how much more productive we can be when we strategize naps and
  breaks to avoid the dreaded afternoon slump. For example:


  1.  Have a **napuccino** – about seven hours after waking, drink a cup of
  coffee and set your timer for 25 minutes; five minutes to fall asleep and 20
  minutes to sleep. Repeat as necessary each day.

  2.  **Walk** – Set your timer every hour and take a five-minute walk.

  3.  Get **outside** – nature replenishes us.

  4.  Be **social** – talk to someone about something other than work. Better
  yet, thank someone.

  5.  **Shift gears** – meditate or just focus on your breathing, or listen to a
  funny podcast.

  6.  **Lunch break** – don’t eat at your desk, try to include any of the above
  suggestions in the break you take for lunch.


  The highest performing people work fifty-two minutes and break for seventeen.
  The highest performing schools have fifteen-minute breaks every hour. But even
  micro breaks can help.


  If you introduce more breaks into your organization or just into your own day,
  you too will enjoy increased motivation, concentration and enhanced
  creativity.


  The ideal plan to ward off the afternoon slump? Consider a short walk outside
  with a friend during which you talk about something other than work.

  of when."- When, page 89


  When we begin the school day has tremendous implications beyond what time the
  gym is available for extra-curricular activities. Why?


  The timing described above changes throughout life. After genetics, the
  biggest predictor of what type of bird you are is your age. You know young
  children are usually Larks; waking up raring to go early and petering out in
  the early evening. Around puberty however, those larks morph into owls. They
  wake up later, experience their best energy in the late afternoon and evening
  and fall asleep well after parents.


  Beginning the school day for teens before 8:30am can impair their health and
  hobble their grades. The evidence is so overwhelming that the American Academy
  of Pediatrics issued a policy statement calling for middle and high schools to
  begin no earlier than 8:30am. The CDC concluded that “delaying school start
  times has the potential for the greatest population impact” in boosting
  teenage learning and well-being.


  For example, car crashes and depression go down while attendance and grades go
  up! In one study of 30,000 student across seven states, high school graduation
  increased by 11%! Wow! A proven, free way to make significant change. Why
  aren’t all school boards onto this? (When you grab your copy of _When_, check
  out pages 90 and 91 for evidence that shows we must run not walk to our school
  board offices to demand this change.)

  What am I going to do differently? I am going to take down time much more

> “I used to believe that timing was everything. Now I believe that everything is timing.” _\- When, page 218_

Have you ever said: “Timing is everything”? What exactly did you mean by that?

We’ve all studied _how-to_ books and lately we’ve focused on _why-to_ books but what about _when-to_? Think of this book as a new genre of _when-to._ It gives you glasses to make the invisible effects of timing, visible.

Daniel Pink, who has authored some of my favorite books on behavioral psychology, brings new insight to help us work smarter and live better. _When, The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing,_ is his sixth game-changing book. In it, he analyzes more than seven hundred studies from the fields of economics, anesthesiology, anthropology, endocrinology, chronobiology and social psychology to unearth the hidden science of timing. He then guides us to think how discoveries around the invisible power of timing can help us better build teams, organizations, schools and lives.

If you want to improve your performance, enhance your health and deepen your satisfaction, read on for just three of the many gems from this excellent book.
