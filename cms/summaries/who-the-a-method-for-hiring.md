  ### Who Matters


  > "Who is where the magic begins, or where the problems start."- Who, page xiv


  “The most important decisions that businesspeople make are not _what_
  decisions but _who_ decisions.” (Jim Collins, _Good to Great_). _What_ refers
  to your strategies, your products, services and processes. It’s people (the
  _who_) who decide the _what._ Without the people, there is no _what._ This may
  be obvious but we often waste time trying to fix the process when the right
  person would have fixed it long ago. We make do with what we have and set up a
  culture of adequacy. What a disservice to ourselves and to our staff. “Your
  success as a manager is simply the result of how good you are at hiring the
  people around you” (Joe Mansueto, Founder of _Morningstar_).


  “The leaders we interviewed for this book spend as much as 60% of their time
  thinking about people.” (_Who_, page 149).


  Based on their research, the authors have concluded that a single hiring
  blunder can cost 15 times the person’s base annual salary. Some of that is in
  hard costs such as recruitment, compensation, training and severance. Go
  beneath the surface and it’s worse; what about the mistakes, missed
  opportunities, damaged customer relationships, disruption to the team and
  management time?


  _Who_ mistakes happen when managers:


  *   _Are unclear about what is needed in a job_

  *   _Have a weak flow of candidates_

  *   _Do not trust their ability to pick out the right candidate from a group
  of similar looking candidates_

  *   _Lose candidates they really want to join their team_

  ### The Power of Priority


  > "We define an A Player this way: a candidate who has at least a 90 percent
  chance of achieving a set of outcomes that only the top 10 percent of possible
  candidates could achieve."- Who, page 12


  An A Player is usually not a brilliant all rounder who comes to you
  immaculately dressed with the gift of the gab and a winning smile. The A
  player is in the top 10% in a specific quality. Think “All Star Goaltender”
  rather than “Good Hockey Player”. To better qualify fit with the role,
  consider the following pieces of information: This where you define what you
  need (few companies or individuals do this):


  *   **Create a scorecard with 3 parts** – 1) the job’s core purpose, 2) what
  does success look like for this role, including the metrics to measure the
  results and 3) what behaviours, skills and values match this role?

  *   **The source of your applicants**. can you gather background information
  on the person, beyond what they’re telling you, and beyond the typical
  “reference calls?”

  *   **How to sell the selected person on the job**. Understand what she or he
  cares about, and look for the real opportunities in the role to provide them
  with it.

  ### Beware the Resume... and your response to it


  > "What is a resume? It is a record of a person’s career with all of the
  accomplishments embellished and all the failures removed."- CEO George
  Buckley, quoted in Who, page xvii


  Before we learn how to hire the right candidate, it’s worth looking at our own
  hiring mistakes. The authors refer to **“voodoo hiring methods”**, some of
  which you may be guilty of using in the past. These practices include:


  *   The Art Critic

  *   The Sponge

  *   The Animal Lover

  *   The Chatterbox

  *   The Prosecutor

  *   The Fortune Teller


  **“The Art Critic”** prides herself on her ability to judge what she sees. Her
  gut tells her all she needs to know but she ends up with a stomach ache. Don’t
  trust your gut – your instinct can help you tell someone is wrong for the job
  but not that someone will amaze you with the results. **“The Sponge”** likes
  to let everyone interview a candidate – the more the merrier. If everyone
  likes him, he’s got to be good. Typically the same superficial questions get
  asked by each team member and all you actually learn is that this candidate is
  patient enough to handle repetition. Then there’s **“The Animal Lover”** with
  his back pocket list of pet interview questions that he brings to every
  interview. He’s looking for the cleverest response – fun, but what does that
  have to do with _this_ job? Pick up a copy of _Who_ to find out about **“The
  Chatterbox”**, **“The Prosecutor”** and **“The Fortune-teller”** and more.
  There’s a profile or two for each of us who have hired poorly or who have
  occasionally hired well through sheer luck. No more will we “voodoo hire”.
  Embrace the knowledge in this book and you will see how to hire A Players,
  consistently.


  As a starting point, beware how much stock you put in the resume. It’s a good
  conversation starter, but remember that the depth of that conversation (and
  the value of it) is up to you. As we walk through insight #2, start to think
  through the specific questions you can ask a candidate – questions that well
  help you **quantify** the value this person could have to the role and the
  team.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Who_ is exceptional because it offers us achievable techniques to hire people
  who will ensure that they (and our businesses!) thrive.

Do you own a small business and seek someone to help your business grow? Are you on the board of directors searching for new CEO? Perhaps you’re a parent who had a bad experience with a baby sitter. Geoff Smart and Randy Street provide a simple, practical, and effective solution to hiring the A players in their _New York Times_ bestseller, _Who_.

If you have had a problem hiring, you’re not alone. _The Economist_ recently reported that finding the right people is the single biggest problem in business today (_Who_, page 4). _Who_ provides learning acquired from an unprecedented assemblage of more than 20 billionaires, over 30 CEOs of multi billion dollar companies, plus other CEOs, managers, investors, non-profit heads and management experts who were interviewed over more than 1300 hours.

There’s an equally powerful side benefit to _Who: The A Method For Hiring_. You can turn it around and apply the learning to help you define the right job for yourself and impress the hiring team, even if they don’t ask the right questions.
