  ### Fuel perceptions with intentional stories


  > "The fuel of perceptions--good and bad--is storytelling. That’s why we need
  to be more intentional about the stories we tell."- Whoever Tells the Best
  Story Wins, page 22-23


  Simmons identifies six of the most influential story types:


  *   **Who-I-am stories** tell listeners what qualifies you to influence them.

  *   **Why-I’m-here stories** establish your reasons for being there.

  *   **Teaching stories** instruct without sounding like a lesson.

  *   **Vision stories** reframe the present as inevitable steps toward a
  worthwhile future.

  *   **Values-in-action stories** illustrate principles by showing how they
  play out in the real world.

  *   **I-know-what-you’re-thinking stories** empathize and disarm inevitable
  skepticism.


  Simmons contends that we tell these six types of stories all the time.
  Unfortunately, our default storytelling mode too often turns negative. To
  increase our positive influence on others, she urges us to mindfully tell
  stories that achieve goals rather than reinforce problems.


  Never is this more on display than at a wedding. I happened to finish
  Simmons’s book while attending my oldest son’s wedding in sunny, snowy Denver.
  This gave me occasion to hear both positive and negative stories of each type.
  Without naming names, one guest told a who-I-am story that made him sound like
  a perpetual victim wronged by the universe at every turn while another shared
  a vision story about her potential startup that had me reaching for my
  checkbook. Each story fueled my perception of the teller, but in entirely
  opposite directions.

  ### Tell stories that add substance to vision


  > "Story forces substance back into the vision process. Laminated cards with
  core values and quippy sound-bite visions are exposed as superficial and
  one-dimensional when compared to vision stories."- Whoever Tells the Best
  Story Wins, page 99


  According to Simmons, it’s impossible to imagine the future unless you
  actually take someone there through story. It allows your listener to
  “experience places and times intimately enough to play out the possibilities.”
  Compelling vision stories also validate the difficulties of achieving it,
  giving due regard to the real pain, sacrifice and frustration that will
  undoubtedly occur.


  Another favorite author, Daniel Pink, provides a compelling framework for
  sharing a vision story in his 2013 book, [_To Sell is
  Human_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/to-sell-is-human/).
  His “Pixar pitch” helps to give any pitch (or vision) a narrative structure by
  framing it using the six blanks used by Pixar films: Once upon a time
  \_\_\_\_\_\_, Every day \_\_\_\_\_\_, One day \_\_\_\_\_, Because of that
  \_\_\_\_\_\_, Because of that \_\_\_\_\_\_, Until finally \_\_\_\_\_\_.

  ### Tell stories that validate then dispel objections


  > "People like to stay safe. Many times they have already made up their mind,
  with specific objections to the ideas you bring...it is a trust-building
  surprise for you to share their secret suspicions in a story that first
  validates and then dispels these objections without sounding defensive."-
  Whoever Tells the Best Story Wins, page 25


  Of the types, my favorite is the I-know-what-you’re-thinking story. According
  to Simmons, telling one makes you seem telepathic because you’ve magically
  anticipated unstated reservations about you and your message.


  To help craft different stories of each type, she suggests coming up with one
  about a time you shined, another about a time you blew it, a third about a
  mentor and a fourth that comes from a book, movie or special event.


  For my I-know-what-you’re-thinking story, I chose a time I shined. Since my
  natural presentation style is extremely low-key, audiences occasionally feel I
  lack Tony Robbins-like enthusiasm for a topic even when I’m passionate about
  it. To acknowledge then dispel this myth during one presentation, I shared a
  story about how I once got so intense at a daughter’s volleyball match, the
  local news photographer snapped a picture of me cheering at the top of my
  lungs. Then I shared the photo of me with my arms flying and told my audience:
  “In spite of how I sometimes come across, this is how I feel about you and
  this subject matter.” More important than the ensuing laughter, my audience
  believed me in ways merely repeating the words, “I’m excited,” would never
  have accomplished.

  Annette Simmons believes “every problem in the world can be addressed–solved,
  made bearable, even eliminated–with better storytelling.”

Annette Simmons has nothing against facts, statistics and other objective data. She just wants people to actually hear what we’re trying to tell them. And to be heard, we need to tell stories.

In _Whoever Tells the Best Story Wins_, she equips us with the storytelling skills we need to give listeners faith in us and our good intentions.

Above all, this book is actionable and only succeeds if we make the effort to create our own stories using the templates she provides. If we don’t, we’re merely listening to a master storyteller share some great tales.
