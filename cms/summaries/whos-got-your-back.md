  ### Even the Lone Ranger Had Tonto


  > "Behind every great leader, at the base of every great tale of success, you
  will find an indispensable circle of trusted advisors, mentors and
  colleagues."- Who’s Got Your Back, page 10


  Ferrazzi uses _Who’s Got Your Back_ to share this one important message:
  People are more successful in life (and work) when they are connected to, and
  in constant interaction with, a trusted collection of likeminded individuals.
  Ferrazzi calls those connections your “lifelines”.


  The premise of the book is pretty straight forward. 1) Find a small number of
  people who you would like to build a mutually caring and supportive
  relationship with, 2) build those relationships and 3) allow those people to
  push, challenge and hold you accountable to becoming more successful than you
  ever would have on your own.


  The idea is simple in theory, yet potentially daunting in reality and near
  impossible without the proper framework in place. Luckily for us, Ferrazzi not
  only explains the value of having lifelines, but provides step by step
  instruction on how to create our own.


  For the purposes of this discussion, let’s assume you have a couple people in
  mind that you would like to have on the “Board of Directors” for You, Inc.
  First, you need to create a supportive foundation in which to mutually explore
  issues and areas of opportunity. As Ferrazzi explains, _“There are four core
  mind-sets – which can be learned and practiced – that form the behavioural
  foundation for creating the kind of lifeline relationships I’m talking
  about.”_


  Those four mind-sets include:


  **Generosity:** The genuine interest in helping the other person without
  payment or trade.  

  **Vulnerability:** A willingness to identify and admit weaknesses.  

  **Candour:** Honesty at its truest level; the willingness to call BS on
  someone’s excuses or false logic.  

  **Accountability:** An openness to being held accountable, and a willingness
  to hold the other accountable to their commitments.


  So how do we establish these kinds of relationships?

  ### Sparring to Lose


  > "You know, Ajit, the goal of an argument is not victory, it’s progress. Ask
  yourself, have we developed any new insights in our discussion? If the answer
  is yes, then we’re making progress."- Who’s Got Your Back, page 180


  So how do you maximize your lifelines, once you’ve identified them and built a
  safe environment? Be open. Be open to suggestion, recommendation, and
  downright confrontation. The point is, you brought these people into your life
  with the intention of growing, of becoming a better version of yourself.
  Ferrazzi explains it as having people around to help you “bust through your
  own glass ceiling”. So keep that front of mind. If you’re asking people to
  challenge you, then appreciate them when they challenge you!


  Put yourself in situations that allow you to grow. Bear your soul and ask the
  tough questions. Get into heated debates. Defend and attack ideas, not
  identities. Keep in mind these are people who love and respect you, but that
  doesn’t mean they have to agree with your ideas. I love this quote from
  Ferrazzi: _“Sparring isn’t about winning. In fact, just the opposite – you
  hope you’ll change! Looking forward to being wrong is one of the most
  eye-opening opportunities sparring offers!”_


  In a discussion or “sparring” match, you get to either be right, or you get to
  improve. You decide which one’s more important.

  ### The Art of the Long Slow Dinner


  > "It’s a sad state of affairs that more and more of us rely so much on the
  moment of birth or marriage or death to step out of our busy, driven lives to
  satisfy our hunger to establish deep relationships with each other."- Who’s
  Got Your Back, page 35


  We rush around a lot these days. (You may have noticed.) We schedule, we
  travel, we barter


  (I’ll do this for you, if you do this for me) and we generally try, 24/7 to
  accomplish “more”. There’s nothing inherently wrong with ambition. Where I
  would argue there is something wrong is in our depreciating ability to enjoy
  the moment; to genuinely connect with the people in our lives and, in doing
  so, foster a greater sense of connectedness.


  As much a metaphor as an actual event, the “long slow dinner” doesn’t have to
  be a dinner at all. Simply put, the long slow dinner is a chance to connect;
  an opportunity to build a deeper, more meaningful relationship by showing
  genuine interest in the life of another; an interest, a willingness to help,
  and no hidden agenda. All that’s required is a mutually comfortable space in
  which to speak with someone you trust, someone who you genuinely want to see
  succeed. That, and no looming deadlines. The work day lunch doesn’t usually
  work, unless you both have extremely flexible work schedules.


  Pick an evening over the next two weeks and take someone for dinner, strictly
  for the purpose of helping them grow. Skip the small talk. “Why?” is a great
  question to build depth. Find out what drives them and how you can help.
  You’ll be amazed at the level of depth and appreciation that simple
  three-lettered word can create.
f_conclusion: >-
  With _Who’s Got Your Back_, Ferrazzi reminds us of the importance of asking
  for help. Anyone who feels they “know it all” has quit growing and will soon
  be surpassed. Only through surrounding yourself with people you can learn from
  – people who genuinely care about your success (and you about theirs) – can
  you surpass even your own wild expectations for life and success. Today, pick
  someone you admire and invite them out for the long slow dinner that could
  change your life.

There’s a lie in popular society today, a lie that we embrace and endure because it’s sexy, inspiring and makes for a great story. It’s a lie epitomized in the likes of Steve Jobs, Martha Stewart, Richard Branson, Bono and virtually every other great name of our time. We look at these leaders, these captains of industry and we see individualism. We celebrate the “lone ranger”, the maverick who apparently went solo and overcame all obstacles to achieve wild success. Those who show weaknesses _are_ weak, and those who look to others for support and guidance are lesser people. Right?

As bestselling author Keith Ferrazzi teaches in his brilliant work _Who’s Got Your Back_, nothing could be further from the truth.
