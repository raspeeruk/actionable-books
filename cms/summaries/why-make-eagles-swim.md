  ### Watch and Listen for Relevance


  > "As important as it is to uncover our own attribute profiles, one of the
  most powerful applications of this concept actually lies in tuning into the
  traits of others."- Why Make Eagles Swim? page 91


  I confess my initial focus as I was reading this book was to discover my own
  attribute profile. I was relieved to learn that self-awareness is an essential
  first step as we are prone to interpreting others’ behaviours through the
  lenses of our own strongest attributes and biggest challenge areas. If you’ve
  ever said to yourself, “I don’t understand how he can do that/be that way” you
  are likely seeing the situation through the lens of your own attributes.


  Munn suggests we can discover clues to the attributes of others simply by
  becoming more active and engaged listeners. Rather than listening for content,
  Munn wants us to watch and listen for relevance; to pay attention to what
  someone’s words and actions reveal about their natural attributes. For
  example, when someone says “She must have felt awful,” it suggests they can’t
  imagine _not_ feeling that way. This individual cares how others feel and is
  highly empathic. Similarly we often react negatively to attributes that oppose
  our own. By paying attention to what ‘drives us crazy’ in others, we can
  identify their inherent strengths and our areas of weakness.


  Munn warns us not to jump to conclusions based on a single comment or action.
  Instead he advises readers to look for patterns over time and, when in doubt,
  to ask questions to clarify any assumptions you might be making. One fun way
  to practice listening for relevance is to watch interviews, movies and TV
  shows. Take note of what people or characters said and did that might reveal
  their strengths and weaknesses. It’s a low risk environment and gives you an
  excuse for binge watching a season’s worth of _Big Bang Theory_ or _House of
  Cards_ this weekend!

  ### Dark Needs Light and Day Needs Night


  > "The attributes that are most at odds are actually the pairs that most need
  each other."- Why Make Eagles Swim? page 145


  Consider these two sayings:


  *   Opposites attract.

  *   Birds of a feather flock together.


  Which one is true? Of course, both are true…and both are false. People enjoy
  interacting with others who share similar values, hobbies, dreams and social
  status. We are also drawn to people strong in traits we wish we had. Yet,
  opposites don’t always attract: there are people who simply ‘rub us the wrong
  way’ and we try to minimize our interactions with them.


  Munn suggests that the real lesson of attribute-based leadership is this: _the
  very attribute you would naturally avoid working with is probably the one that
  is best suited to help you._ We saw this in action with Diane and Harry. When
  you catch yourself becoming judgmental of another person’s approach, remind
  yourself that all attributes have value. Ask questions to explore the opposing
  perspective and challenge your own preferences in service of the larger goal.


  Beyond individual learning and development, attributes can positively
  influence and improve hiring decisions, team composition, problem-solving, and
  employee engagement. Identify your current team members’ natural strengths and
  align the work they are doing with those strengths. Fill vacancies with people
  who possess different yet complementary attribute profiles and educate your
  team about the benefits this diversity will yield.

  ### Embrace Differences


  > "By working with and valuing people who are different from you, you can
  propel your personal growth – and your effectiveness in the workplace – to the
  next level."- Why Make Eagles Swim? page 126


  I listen to a jazz radio station and one song that numerous artists have
  covered is “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” written by George and Ira
  Gershwin. You may recognize its _“You like to-may-toes and I like
  to-mah-toes”_ stanza and the quandary of ending a relationship with someone
  you love because they pronounce words (either, neither, potatoes, pajamas)
  differently. It sounds ridiculous and yet so often we let differences divide
  us rather than strengthen us.


  Munn shares the story of Diane and Harry, two executives with opposing
  strengths, who frequently clashed when working together. Diane is a
  ‘developer’ focused on growing the skills of her team. She is also a ‘learner’
  who gathers extensive information before making a decision. Harry is her
  opposite: a ‘decisive’, in-charge guy (commander) who makes decisions quickly
  and pays little attention to his team beyond how they achieve their
  objectives. With the attributes paradigm as a point of reference, each learned
  something from the other’s style that improved their own personal
  effectiveness. Diane observed that her team’s performance suffered when she
  did not promptly address unacceptable individual contributions. Harry
  recognized he could avoid costly errors if he explored issues more fully and
  assigned tasks to align with individual strengths.


  We inadvertently trip ourselves up when we view some attributes as strengths
  and others as weaknesses. Attributes are neutral – neither positive nor
  negative. When we adopt this mindset, we will start to recognize opportunities
  to appreciate and leverage the natural strengths of our colleagues for the
  benefit of all concerned.
f_conclusion: >-
  I found the attributes framework presented in _Why Make Eagles Swim?_ a
  refreshing change from the fix-your-weaknesses philosophy often encountered in
  the workplace. Using practical and insightful examples from his corporate
  practice, Bill Munn showed how a strengths-based paradigm promotes mutual
  understanding and appreciation, and establishes a foundation for more
  meaningful engagement and collaboration.

> “We need a perspective on growth and development that’s focused on where we as well as others are naturally gifted.” _\- Why Make Eagles Swim? page 4_

_Why Make Eagles Swim?_ is a book about valuing strengths and ignoring weaknesses. Management coach Bill Munn advocates persuasively for an engagement philosophy that identifies and develops people’s inherent talents so they can soar higher (like eagles) instead of struggling to improve areas of weakness (teaching eagles to swim better). He challenges the ‘myth of well-roundedness’; the idea that everyone should strive to be good at everything, and illustrates through real-life stories how an attributes-based approach is more effective in attaining personal and organizational success.

_An attribute is an inherent trait or characteristic that influences your perception of and behaviour toward the world around you._ Drawing on years of personal and corporate experience, Munn has created 14 archetypal attribute profiles to describe these inherent traits. Some people are natural communicators, others more conceptual and strategic. Creators are inspired to act on new ideas while logicians analyze for cause and effect. Each of us is a unique blend of these 14 attributes – some very strong, others more subdued. Understanding and recognizing these attributes in ourselves and others opens up a different way of valuing and utilizing our collective strengths.

While eagles can swim when they need to, it’s a situational necessity not a natural preference. How many employees in your organization are expending valuable time, energy and resources trying to make situational gains in areas that are not aligned with their natural strengths? Now, imagine the difference if you instead focused them on doing more of what they do best. Bill Munn and I envision your employees and your organization soaring to new heights!
