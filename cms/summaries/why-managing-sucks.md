  ### Wake Up! We Need A Better Way


  > "We’ve learned that when people have complete control over all of their
  time, they begin to use it wisely to optimize every aspect of their lives,
  including work."- Why Managing Sucks, page 6


  We see countless studies on employee engagement, with employees who are
  frustrated by inconsistent work practices, combined with increasing financial
  and family pressures. They are overwhelmed and unable to contribute fully to
  their work.


  The authors argue that we are over-managing the work schedule by insisting on
  set times and places to work (with employees focusing on face-time with the
  boss or colleagues), and seeing poor productivity from our efforts.


  Still not convinced? Here’s how it can work.

  ### No Results, No Job


  > "Everyone was hired to do a job. They need to be clear about their
  measurable results. If they can’t meet results, no job."- Why Managing Sucks,
  page 30


  All this time, we’ve been focusing on the wrong thing. We’ve been reprimanding
  employees for being late, and avoiding conversations about outcomes. Or worse,
  we’re unclear about what exactly is required, leaving everyone to work in ways
  that aren’t driving business results.


  **One of the biggest challenges for managers in moving to a ROWE is they now
  need to set clear goals, and deal with performance issues quickly**. Employees
  need to understand that they are responsible for getting the work done, and
  managers must focus on ensuring outcomes are met. “HR should be coaching
  managers to be results-focused and objective, and not to cling to old
  subjective beliefs about what work should look and feel like.”


  They are clear to say – this is “disruptive social change.” Implementing a
  ROWE in its truest form won’t be easy, but it is the only way to address the
  significant workplace issues we face today.

  ### Don't Manage The Hours, Manage The Work


  > "...one of the biggest, most dangerous management traps is focusing on
  time."- Why Managing Sucks, page 72


  For managers and employees, it is much easier to manage by the clock. If the
  employee is at their desk at the expected time, both parties may choose to
  believe that success will follow.


  **In a ROWE, employees decide how, when, and where they will get work done.**
  If you’re thinking “we have a flexible work environment so it must be a ROWE”,
  flex work policies simply confuse the issue. The control is still with the
  manager to set guidelines, ensure the policy is followed, and employees are
  “checking in” from their home office during business hours. **In a ROWE,
  there’s no set schedule, no check in – you focus on getting the work done.**


  Managing by time doesn’t help us get the right work done. It’s easier for
  managers to work this way, because they can see their employees and may
  believe that means they know the work is getting done, but as the authors tell
  us, we need to manage based on clear, measurable outcomes, not by time.


  “An authentic ROWE is, in its essence, a contemporary work culture built on
  the foundation that we hire people for clear, measurable results.”


  Hmm, no set schedule? If you’re thinking that this feels like you will be
  expected to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, guess what? Most employees
  already are. The difference with ROWE is that “every day feels like Saturday”.
  You manage all of the aspects of your work and your life, and you are in the
  driver’s seat.


  Well, does ROWE = anarchy? On the contrary.
f_conclusion: >-
  The book is packed with ideas, client testimonials and suggested tactics for
  starting to make ROWE-like changes immediately, even in environments like
  education, healthcare, and manufacturing. If you lead people or have a boss,
  this is a book to read as a team and start to explore how you can create a
  ROWE for your organization. Studies show ROWEs have significantly higher
  productivity and employee engagement, and can be a marketplace differentiator.

The working world today is broken. Organizations are asking employees to do more with less, we waste hundreds of hours commuting at the worst times of the day, and we lose too much time in endless meetings. We continue in this mode as many others have for generations, and wait for the day when we can retire and finally get some sleep.

**Good news – there is another way to work.**

In _Why Managing_ _Sucks and How to Fix It_, authors Jody Thompson and Cali Ressler challenge us to redesign the way we work with the creation of a **Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE)**, a workplace model they invented over ten years ago while working at Best Buy. **They want us to focus on the results, and not worry about the how, when or where of work.**

In the five years since they published their first book, _Why Work Sucks,_ their model has now been successfully implemented in many organizations, and these companies are realizing tremendous business outcomes as a result. This isn’t a fantasy description of a “fun place to work” – this is a new model for how work _should_ be. They believe flexibility shouldn’t be provided to a chosen few, it should be ingrained in a changed corporate culture that provides employees with “improved ability to manage their whole lives in a healthy and happy way.”

The essence of it is that employees, not managers, need to own the work. They alone should determine where the work should be done (whether office, home, or coffee shop), when the work should be done (start at 2 pm? end at 2 pm?), and how the work should be done. Managing becomes a coaching, measurement and issue support role, ensuring that targets and objectives are clearly defined and revisited often.

I am excited about sharing this book with my clients. With _Why Managing Sucks_, managers and employees can really start to picture a different way of working, in an environment that meets the needs of managers and employees alike, by focusing on the results.

Have you worked in a ROWE? Can you imagine working in a ROWE organization?
