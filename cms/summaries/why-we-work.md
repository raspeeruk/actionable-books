  ### False ideas twist reality


  > "However, there are two things about idea technology that make it different
  from most ‘thing technology.’ First, because ideas are not objects, to be
  seen, purchased, and touched, they can suffuse through the culture and have
  profound effects on people before they are even noticed. Second, ideas, unlike
  things, can have profound effects on people even if the ideas are false."- Why
  We Work, page 67


  Nature will never create a Ferrari, and it would be extremely unlikely a play
  by Shakespeare would ever be written by the computer generating random
  characters. Ideas, like all inventions, are unique products of the human mind.
  Nature has a long process which is never complete for testing and tweaking its
  creations. Human brains work much faster, and we finish our inventions. We
  know when things made of physical parts don’t work. Ideas can be deceptive,
  and it’s hard to determine whether or not they work, we may believe them even
  when they are not true. Then we invent more theories based on the false ones.
  All ideas, true and false, shape our reality when we believe them.


  Issac Newton performed experiments where he used a prism to split visible
  light into a spectrum. There were five distinct bands of color (red, yellow,
  green, blue, and violet) but he thought the spectrum should match the scale of
  seven notes. Newton added orange and indigo, which others identified as the
  mixing of two bands. Newton was an expert. He made a spurious connection
  between light and music, and we trusted him. We still see seven colors in a
  rainbow 300 years later. This example shows how a false idea becomes accepted
  as true.

  ### Realize employee ability and promote development


  > "They discovered that managers also seem to have either fixed or incremental
  theories of employee ability. If managers had a fixed theory of ability, they
  were less likely to notice changes in employee performance, and less likely to
  provide feedback and coaching aimed at improvement, than if they had an
  incremental theory of ability."- Why We Work, page 78


  Schwartz mentions the work of Carol S. Dweck, author of
  [_Mindset_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success/).
  She talks about how children achieve things differently depending on their
  goal. If their goal is performance (social recognition and rewards) they avoid
  challenges and give up when they fail in search of easier goals. Children with
  mastery goals (personal satisfaction of doing something well) work harder when
  they fail, so they learn more and become smarter. Not surprisingly, adults at
  work accomplish goals the same way.


  Managers who have a fixed idea of employee ability create a declining work
  environment. They recognize and reward the good performers and don’t help poor
  performers improve. Performance scores become what is important, and employees
  learn how to reach the goal. When Mastery is not the goal, growth and learning
  are unimportant. Employee potential is ignored at considerable expense to the
  organization. Employees are left feeling unsatisfied with their work and work
  only for a paycheck.


  Managers who foster improvement by providing additional training and support
  to employees, especially poor performers, create a growth mindset in the
  workplace. When managers encourage learning and tolerate error, employees feel
  valued and form a deeper connection to the work and the goals of the
  organization. They promote growth, not only personal satisfaction of their
  employees but growth in the company. Employees become engaged and productive
  instead of doing the minimum to reach a goal or giving up and moving on.

  ### Presume people work for more than a paycheck


  > "You start out believing that people are basically lazy, don’t want to work,
  and care only about their pay when they do. Based on this belief, you create a
  workplace that is focused only on efficiency, with jobs that are mindlessly
  repetitive, counting on the paycheck to motivate the workers. Lo and behold,
  in an environment like that, all that matters to workers is their pay."- Why
  We Work, page 75


  If we begin by supposing our employees only work for a paycheck, it is
  necessary to have a structured work environment to keep them on task. Jobs are
  kept small, straightforward and monotonous to be completed efficiently with
  little skill or training. Supervision is hierarchical and punitive.
  Performance is over-measured, and employees are paid according to key
  performance statistics. Autonomous decisions made through discretion—even if
  they are in the best interest of the company—may measure against an employee.
  By believing people work only for pay, we create a work environment that
  validates that idea.


  If we begin by assuming our employees work for richer rewards of meaning,
  discretion, engagement, autonomy, and opportunity to learn, we create
  satisfying work beyond a paycheck. Teams are decentralized and self-managed
  giving them freedom and choice. They provide extensive training with lots of
  opportunities to learn and master more complex jobs. They measure performance,
  but they don’t over measure. They trust employees to do their best work. They
  have a mission that is more than words, and a central goal employees believe
  in. They support employees as a team rather than individuals by providing pay
  and employment security above the standard without relying excessively on
  personal rewards.
f_conclusion: >-
  Even in the most structured and mechanized jobs, there are those employees who
  see beyond their job description and add challenges and variations to their
  work to create value and meaning while doing almost any job. They may
  challenge themselves to create quality human interactions or create beauty in
  other ways that are not intrinsic to the job. These people don’t believe that
  work should be done only for pay. There are also companies that have
  reexamined the accepted idea that job satisfaction should be the price of
  productivity. They allow for growth and learning, measure performance but
  emphasize good work, and compensate team members equally because everyone
  helps the organization, they value employees and their job. These individuals
  and organizations reject the idea that we work for pay and build value into
  their lives and their companies without sacrificing financial success. Our
  human nature defines not only who we are, but it shapes our world. Isn’t it
  worth changing our minds about why we work?
f_quote-2: >-
  "If we want to help design a human nature that seeks and finds challenge,
  engagement, meaning, and satisfaction from work, we have to start building our
  way out of a deep hole that almost three centuries of misconceptions about
  human motivation and human nature have put us in, and help foster workplaces
  in which, challenge, engagement, meaning, and satisfaction are possible."

For the past three centuries, we have focused on performance, productivity, and efficiency in the workplace. We have accepted the idea that work is not supposed to satisfy the worker, people work for money and division of labor, routine, mechanized work is the way to make more money. Only highly educated professionals should hope to find meaning, discretion, engagement, autonomy, and opportunity to learn and grow in their work. In _Why We Work_, Barry Schwartz challenges this view and elaborates on why it damages our society.
