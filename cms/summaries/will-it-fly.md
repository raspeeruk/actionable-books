  ### Do Your Homework!


  > "Your earnings are a by-product of how well you serve your audience, and you
  can only best serve your audience when you know exactly who they are, what
  they’re going through, and what will get them to take action."- Will It Fly?
  page 189


  Homework. If you are like me, the word causes you to shudder and conjures up
  images of dull, dreary and painfully boring exercises supposedly designed to
  help you master a concept. It took time away from far more interesting and
  personally rewarding activities and so was to be avoided or rushed through as
  quickly as possible. That strategy may have worked for you in school, however,
  it’s a strategy that will likely prove to be a costly mistake in business.


  Flynn advises aspiring entrepreneurs to invest the time to do in-depth
  customer research before investing too much money and energy in launching a
  new product or service. Surprisingly, the frameworks and strategies he shares
  are both simple to do and interesting. The result is a Customer PLAN that
  improves your chances of developing a product or service that customers will
  actually buy. In a nutshell, PLAN is shorthand for:


  **P**roblems – what your potential customer struggles with or is frustrated by
  and is seeking a solution for


  **L**anguage – how your customer describes their problems, goals, and
  aspirations (keywords, phrases)


  **A**necdotes – real life customer stories that help you ‘stand in their
  shoes’


  **N**eeds – what you believe the customer requires to solve an identified
  problem (which is different than the product or service you are going to
  validate or build – that is the mechanism through which you hope to satisfy
  the identified need).


  Aspiring and established business owners alike should take this homework very
  seriously because a successful business excels at solving customer problems.
  Failing to intimately understand your customer’s biggest problems and unmet
  needs, the language they use (and therefore will relate most easily to) and
  the context within which these problems or aspirations manifest themselves,
  jeopardizes your chances of delivering a desirable solution that people will
  pay for.


  Before you drop this summary to pull together your customer PLAN, let’s look
  at some other important research that Flynn believes will help you bring your
  business idea to market more effectively.

  ### Test the Waters


  > "The problem that a lot of startups and entrepreneurs run into, even when
  they do the proper research, is that they don’t validate the research through
  real-life testing with real-life customers."- Will It Fly? page 40


  Learning about your ideal client—who they are, what problems they are trying
  to solve, where they look for solutions and who they engage with—is important,
  yet not sufficient, pre-launch research. Smart entrepreneurs take the time to
  test the waters with a small sub-set of their targeted customers. The sayings,
  “Talk is cheap” and “Actions speak louder than words” ring true in the world
  of business. Flynn emphasizes the importance of having “_your target audience
  validate_ \[your idea\] _with their_ **_actions_**_, not just with their
  words.”_ and outlines four critical steps in the validation process:


  1.  Get in front of your target audience.

  2.  Hyper-target.

  3.  Interact and share your solution.

  4.  Ask for the transaction.


  The steps are sequential and done on a micro-level to test the usefulness and
  desirability of your business concept up to this point. You must find and
  capitalize on ways to be visible to your ideal customer before you can share
  your solution and invite people to try it. Again, Flynn generously describes
  both online and offline ways to do this, from targeted click-through
  advertising and participating in forums and social media groups to attending
  industry conferences, doing speaking engagements and even offering freebies.


  You have probably been on the receiving end of another vendor’s pilot
  testing—offers of a free webinar, a free download of a tool or white paper, or
  a survey on what topics the blogger you follow should focus on in the coming
  year. Testing your concept with a small sample of your customers both
  validates you are on the right path and generates suggestions to further
  improve your offering. This saves you time and money in the long-run.

  ### Pan for Gold


  > "By identifying existing authorities that your target audience already
  trusts, you can collect massive insight as to how your audience behaves, what
  they respond to, and what they ignore."- Will It Fly? page 167


  Every business owner dreams of striking it rich. What many often overlook is
  the painstaking work that goes into finding that nugget of gold buried within
  the sand and gravel. Once again, Flynn simplifies our prospecting by having us
  populate a marketing map (actually a multi-tabbed spreadsheet) capturing the
  **places, people and products** that currently describe our market niche.


  Much of this panning for gold occurs online—in blogs, forums and social media
  groups—so there really isn’t any excuse for avoiding this type of homework.
  Especially when Flynn shares a super simple sniper search strategy that is
  definitely worth its weight in gold (insert keyword: keyword)! Translated,
  this means honing your Google search to generate targeted results. So if your
  business idea is related to fly fishing, your searches look like:


  Blog: fly fishing


  Forum: fly fishing


  Podcast: fly fishing


  A well-researched market map helps you to identify:


  *   where your customers hang out online and what makes them tick,

  *   the key influencers within your identified market niche, and

  *   the products and services currently being pitched to your potential
  customers.


  This is a goldmine of information that will help you to _launch, grow and
  monetize your business_ and it is homework that most of your competition has
  skipped over.

  I thoroughly enjoyed reading _Will It Fly?_ Pat Flynn is an engaging and
  inspiring business coach who convinced me market research is not a complicated
  undertaking. I have scheduled time in my calendar to complete my market map
  and develop my customer PLAN and I’m actually looking forward to it. This
  quote, posted in the product notes for the book on Amazon.ca, sums things up
  perfectly: _“Will It Fly? will challenge you to think critically, act
  deliberately, and dare greatly.”_ What more could you possibly ask from a
  book?

Although he doesn’t know it yet, Pat Flynn has become my new BFF (best friend forever). His book _Will it Fly? How to Test Your Next Business Idea so you don’t Waste Your Time and Money_ takes the often overwhelming process of assessing a business concept and breaks it down into simple, actionable and, dare I say, fun activities that help you assess, test and validate your idea before you quit your day job. He utilizes an airplane metaphor to guide readers through the various stages of this process and shares his own developmental work to illustrate both the process and the output. This isn’t the type of book you simply read: this is a hands-on manual that teaches you to fly (if you do the work as you go)!
