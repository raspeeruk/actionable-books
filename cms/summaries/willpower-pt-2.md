  ### Influence Great Outcomes


  > "Exercising self-control in one area seemed to improve all areas of life."-
  Willpower, page 136


  The authors provide extensive examples of how those who were able to develop
  skills to master self-control in one aspect of their lives (such as exercise),
  led to abilities in all other aspects (e.g., they smoked less, drank less,
  kept their homes cleaner, etc.). Building a strong foundation of strength in
  self-control gives us the ability to exert willpower in many aspects of our
  lives. This becomes particularly important if the goals you set require
  persistence and dedication, as it can be too easy to get off track.

  ### Routine and Good Habits


  > "...their willpower gradually got stronger, so it was less readily depleted.
  . . (a)s long as you were motivated to do some kind of exercise, your overall
  willpower could improve."- Willpower, page 137


  The example above talks about exercise but it applies to any scenario where
  you need to exert self-control. Doing so can help build willpower that can
  apply to all aspects of your life. Good habits of exercise and moderate
  portion control, for example, can become routine and no longer requires
  exertion of willpower to maintain the habit.


  _“If you struggle with temptation and then give in, you’re still depleted
  because you struggled. Giving in does not replenish the willpower you have
  already expended.”_


  The authors cover key willpower drains such as procrastination and dieting,
  and many of the elements they cover are common stumbling blocks for anyone
  trying to make their resolutions or commitments stick.


  The book focuses primarily on the individual’s perspective in conquering
  self-control, but it would be interesting to consider it from a marketing or
  manager’s perspective – what do you need to do to break down someone’s
  willpower (e.g., for impulse purchases) or motivate them to stick to tough
  tasks to reach significant goals?

  ### Boost Willpower and Self-control


  > "To promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make the
  body want to go and do that very thing."- Mark Twain, quoted in Willpower,
  page 234


  Our minds can play physical tricks on us, as felt in the cravings for the very
  thing we are trying to eliminate from our life. The authors provide extensive
  evidence connecting our body’s sugar (glucose) levels to our ability to exert
  self-control. If your glucose levels are low, so is your willpower; plus, you
  deplete glucose by exerting willpower as well.


  _“Even just expecting to exert self-control makes the body hungry for
  sweets.”_


  So how to overcome what might seem like a losing battle? The authors recommend
  planning for a period that requires strong self-control, particularly in
  ensuring you manage the physical impact of willpower exertions.


  **Some of their tips include:**


  *   **Small, frequent (healthy) meals to “feed the beast**” with low glycemic
  foods (they mention vegetables, nuts, raw fruits (apples, blueberries, pears)
  cheese, fish, meats, olive oil and other “good fats” to regulate your blood
  sugar levels.

  *   **Ensure adequate sleep** – “by resting, we reduce the body’s demand for
  glucose, and we also improve its overall ability to make use of glucose in the
  bloodstream.”

  *   Try **small physical self-control routines** (like using proper posture,
  or always using “yes” instead of “yup”) which can strengthen your brain for
  bigger tasks, like dieting or quitting smoking.

  *   **Tackle only one change at a time**. You don’t have enough willpower to
  handle multiple changes.

  *   **Defer the reward** – tell yourself “not now, maybe later” is sometimes
  enough to trick your brain into avoiding it altogether.

  So… find that New Year’s resolution or lifelong goal that you want to achieve,
  and get started! With _Willpower_, you have the framework, strategies and
  tools you need to accomplish any of those major goals on your list. Just make
  sure you only tackle one goal at a time. Oh, and bring a snack.

Ever have a goal that seemed out of reach? If you are like 99% of the people I know, you have tackled a change, resolution or new self-help project that became too difficult to see through to the end. If those goals are still on your life to do list, _Willpower_ can help you reach them, by teaching you the physical and mental elements necessary for developing the self-control you need to keep you on that path. While I am not convinced that willpower is the _greatest_ human strength (I would argue our capacity for compassion would top any list), I do agree that strengths in willpower and self-control are key for anyone who wants to set and achieve a significant goal.

The authors of this book, Roy Baumeister and John Tierney, have spent a lifetime analyzing willpower and its effects on human life. Although scientific, with numerous studies referenced throughout, the structure and approach are easy to follow, and the reader is left with a workable set of approaches for improving willpower and self-control.

The authors provide extensive examples of how those who were able to develop skills to master self-control in one aspect of their lives (such as exercise), led to abilities in all other aspects (e.g., they smoked less, drank less, kept their homes cleaner, etc.). Building a strong foundation of strength in self-control gives us the ability to exert willpower in many aspects of our lives. This becomes particularly important if the goals you set require persistence and dedication, as it can be too easy to get off track.
