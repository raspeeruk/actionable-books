  ### Your body can be louder than your words


  > "…the nonverbal cues are more than 10 times as important in your audience
  perceiving your belief or conviction concerning the material."- Winning Body
  Language, page 7


  If you are interested in persuading and influencing others, you should be
  aware that your body may not be supporting your words. Imagine if you took
  control and focused your body to support your message. Compared to the brain,
  it is a much larger organ and it can quickly draw the minds of everyone around
  you into or out of alignment.


  You likely remember Mehrabian’s 7-38-55 percent rule. Before his research, we
  all guessed that words would be the most impactful element of communication
  between words, tone of voice, and body language. He threw that thinking upside
  down with his claim that body language accounts for 55% of a receiver’s
  understanding, tone of voice accounts for 38% while words are responsible for
  only the remaining 7%. Think about that. The feeling, attitude or intent of
  our communication is almost entirely dependent on the non-verbal message
  (93%), not on what we say! So let’s increase our awareness of what to do and
  not to do with our body language.


  Bowden talks about where our hands are when our mouth is talking. He divides
  the body into the GesturePlane System. Above the head is “ecstasy”, from the
  temple to the top of the head is “thought”, from the chin to the nose is
  “disclosure”, from the waist to the chin is “passion”, the waist itself is
  “truth”, below the waist is “grotesque” (from the word cave or meaning hidden
  and thus untrustworthy). So, keep these planes in mind when you move your
  hands. What are you trying to communicate?

  ### Do you really mean it?


  > "…my eyes were opened to the extreme power in the body to understand and
  change psychological and emotional states. (More so than thought, intention
  and feeling can ever do by themselves)."- Winning Body Language, page 28


  The sun is setting and the campfire is aglow with crackling flames and golden
  red embers. You hear the peaceful cry of the loon just off the shore.
  Everything is perfect. As you stand together looking out over the lake, he
  puts his hands in his pockets and utters the words you were waiting to hear “I
  love you”. But wait, something isn’t quite right. What is it? Did you see it –
  the conflict between the words and the body language?


  Let’s try that again….


  The sun is setting and the campfire is aglow with crackling flames and golden
  red embers. You hear the peaceful cry of the loon just off the shore.
  Everything is perfect. As you stand together looking out over the lake, he
  turns to you, cups his hands over each other on his chest and utters the words
  you were waiting to hear “I love you”.


  Ah, that’s better. In the first example, his body wasn’t mirroring his words.
  With his hands in his pockets, they are hidden from sight. This causes
  distrust. In the second example they were on his chest which communicates his
  passion.


  Bowden teaches us the “PassionPlane”–where your hands should be–to express
  passion. When your hands come up to your chest when you gesture and speak
  there is an energetic buzz. Try it yourself. Say “I love you” with your hands
  down to your side. Now move your hands up to your chest and say it. Feel the
  difference?


  A passionate, energized body will impact how well your message is received.
  The audience responds in wonderful ways because they can’t help but feel and
  mirror your excitement. Your audience will never rise above your level of
  enthusiasm. I’m not so shy to gesture with my hands now from the stage.

  ### A tip to reduce anxiety while presenting


  > "...this physical positioning of the hands at the height of the belly and
  open: across all cultures and across all times, is the strongest symbol for
  ‘you can trust me’."- Winning Body Language, page 56


  If you are like 95% of the population, you will experience some anxiety over
  presentations. Want a quick tip to reduce this anxiety?


  Most presenters make the common mistake of standing still and dropping their
  hands down to their side when presenting. In fact, they have often been
  trained to do this! But don’t! When you stand still with your arms hanging
  down, the body takes this as a signal to rest, or even sleep. The voice
  follows and drops in tone.


  This standing with your arms at your side position may also subconsciously
  tell your body that you are now a static target. Your body responds by
  “playing dead”. After all, if I am in danger (the audience could eat me alive)
  and I can’t move, then I better pretend to be dead or very weak so I won’t get
  eaten. It’s just evolution working. In both situations, the audience quickly
  mirrors the relaxation and trances out.


  Rather, simply raise your hands to your “TruthPlane” above your waistline.
  This serves as a counter measure to the physical effects of the anxiety. Most
  people describe the feeling that they get from having their hands around the
  navel area as being ‘centred’, ‘collected’, ‘composed’ or ‘calm’. They feel
  more levelheaded, balanced and energized. The audience perceives and aura of
  calm, professionalism.


  As a professional speaker, I always wondered what the heck to do with my hands
  and this tip really helped. I now hold my elbows at my side with my hands at
  waist height extended toward the audience with my palms facing upward and
  toward each other. To make points I will move my hands or bring my fingers
  together. The “truthplane” is now their home base.

  What is the vocabulary of your body language? Bowden illuminates an important
  nonverbal aspect that can help or hinder your ability to influence and
  persuade. Being more aware is the first step. Understanding the various planes
  and what they communicate is the next.

How are you sitting right now? What is it saying to people around you? Did you just sit up a little straighter? How much thought do you put into what your body is saying when your mouth is talking?

Mark Bowden is an elite trainer to G8 Leaders, Fortune 50 CEOs, and business people who want to gain an advantage beyond the words they speak. We can benefit from his lessons too since he packaged them in a step-by-step guide in his book _Winning Body Language_.

The bottom line, you will improve your ability to communicate and persuade. His lessons help you achieve consistency between the messages you send verbally and those you send nonverbally. Introducing us to the various “planes” of our body, Bowden shows us what not to do and what to do to gain trust and influence.

Oh, a final quick tip. Would you like people to feel instantly engaged and immediately like you when they meet you? It all starts with the handshake Bowden says. When you shake hands, simply turn the other person’s hand quickly and gently so that it is slightly over yours, and at the same time quickly and gently move both yours and his clasped hands closer toward and into your vulnerable stomach area (right at a level with the belly button – the TruthPlane). I think I’ll give it a try! What are you going to try? What does your body say to your audience?
