  ### The Story Test


  > "We can create patterns of stories that lift audiences up to become
  evangelists for our messages and call them to participation in a creating a
  better world."- Winning the Story Wars, page 32


  Stories are at risk. “Sins” are being committed. The sins include:


  *   **Narcissism** – Stories become self-centered instead of being about “us.”

  *   **Authority** – “Just the facts” lack emotional connection to the story.

  *   **Insincerity** – Stories that try too hard to please lose their core.

  *   **Puffery** – Stories with no substance fall flat.

  *   **Gimmickry** – Pursuing “going viral” can create a “falsity” to a story.


  The point is stories are in danger of losing their value and potential in
  engaging people. Marketers are guilty of attacking them in multiple ways, so
  we need to test our stories and ensure they are sin-free. We need to craft
  stories to engage honestly and personally.


  The story test includes:


  *   **Tangible** – Present information that people can “touch” and “feel.”

  *   **Relatable** – Include characters that people want to see rewarded or
  punished.

  *   **Immersive** – Develop the story so others can learn something of value.

  *   **Memorable** – Add scenes and metaphors that make it easy for people to
  recall the core message.

  *   **Emotional** – Elevate others in what they feel or learn.


  To prevent stories from committing sins, they need to pass the story test. The
  more the above elements are in a story, the greater the opportunity for the
  story to be powerful and engage a community.


  To create story evangelists, these elements need to be embraced fully in order
  to write a story that stands the test of time.

  ### Know Your Values


  > "But the core strategy of empowerment marketing is not about magical
  fulfillment. It’s about values and inspiration."- Winning the Story Wars, page
  134


  Brands have an opportunity to promote higher values. To do this, we need to
  understand them and make a commitment to them. Values need to be embedded into
  the story test elements. It is a powerful engagement point between the brand
  and the audience (i.e., customers, enthusiasts).


  Some brands have values defined by who they are. Patagonia is about
  adventurers; it is the value on which it was founded. Amnesty International is
  about human rights; it just is who they are. If the brand doesn’t have
  ready-defined values, then there is a two-step process to select them:


  **Step 1:** Review values and think about what you want to be. Try out
  different values and see what fits. The author lists out nine brand-defining
  values that come from Maslow’s hierarchy, and they include: wholeness,
  perfection, justice, richness, simplicity, beauty, truth, uniqueness, and
  playfulness. Again, the key point is to answer this question: Where do you
  want to go?


  **Step 2:** Narrow the values to three, with one or two being ideal. Selecting
  a value(s) that align across four areas – founding story, offering,
  leadership, and audiences – will be the best.


  Alignment of values is critical, as it relates to authenticity of the brand
  and story.

  ### Tell the Truth


  > "Telling the truth – most importantly, the truth that human nature goes
  beyond our basest desires and orients to a higher potential – provides the
  foundation of a storytelling strategy that can build your next breakthrough
  communication – and your entire brand."- Winning the Story Wars, page 115


  Why is it challenging to tell the truth in stories? The reasons may relate
  back to the sins, but telling the truth should be at the center of our
  stories. It is just solid marketing.


  Telling the truth needs to bring the brand to life and the author provides
  three tactics to do this.


  **The first is to tell a more resonant truth.** In the 1950s, when Cadillac
  was telling the story of personal achievement and fine taste, Volkswagen
  Beetle took a “Think Small” approach, changing the truth to living within your
  means.


  **The second tactic is to emphasize the power of the audience.** Nike launched
  a “Courage” campaign in which athletes tell their story of perseverance and
  overcoming the odds. The story is about the audience; it is a story about
  others that breathes life into the brand.


  **The third tactic is inspiration.** Inspired customers become brand
  evangelists. Think “Yes We Can,” and you see the power of inspiration in the
  story.


  Truth comes through in different ways – communicating what your product really
  is; bringing your audience into the story; or inspiring your audience to
  become partners. Telling the truth means living the truth, too. This approach
  needs to embody the elements in the story test as well as avoid the story
  sins.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Winning the Story Wars_ is full of character and advice on how to develop
  stories that can stand the test of time. Our culture is influenced by great
  stories, changing what we do and how we do it. Stories built upon the sins and
  inauthenticity, on the other hand, are quickly uncovered and rejected.

  "So many of the stories that have really stuck, that have shaped culture, are
  about one thing: people reaching for their highest potential and struggling to
  create a better world. If the test of time is our judge, stories with this
  formula have a near-monopoly on greatness."

We love great stories. They engage. They provide an outlet or a relation point. Stories bring us in and, at times, change us. This is what _Winning the Story Wars: Why Those Who Tell (and Live) the Best Stories Will Rule the Future_ by Jonah Sachs celebrates.

Our culture is pulled forward or changed through stories and the myths embedded in them. Myths are not lies; they hold us together around a set of common beliefs and values. “When myths are functioning properly, they bring us together and get us to act by using a specific formula that appears to be universal across all cultures” (pg 59).

Stories play a central role in our culture, our life, and our marketing, so we need to get them right and empower their value. And “getting them right”, Sach tells us, is becoming more rare as stories are packaged as cheap marketing tools.

Building a successful brand is about sharing stories that engage and empower a community. As Jonah Sachs said, “Perfect alignment of your organization’s values and actions may be a destination you will never fully attain, but the moment you set out on the path, you begin generating compelling content perfectly aligned with your story strategy.”
