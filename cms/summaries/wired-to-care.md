  ### Walk a Mile in Their Shoes


  > "Over time, any organization can learn to hear what people outside its walls
  are talking about, feel what they are feeling, and see the world through their
  eyes."- Wired to Care, page 139


  What is empathy? Empathy means to be able to feel what someone else is
  feeling. Or, at least, to be able to strongly imagine what another person
  feels in his or her situation.


  **How can we create strong empathy?** The old saying goes “Walk a mile in
  their shoes.” One day in 1979, Patty Moore, an industrial designer, came up
  with a unique way to do just that. In order to understand what it was like to
  be an elderly person, Patty modified her appearance, movement and senses to
  change how she experienced the world. She put on a body brace to make her
  shoulders hunch. She plugged up her ears to make hearing difficult. She added
  glasses to make it harder to see. When she had achieved the desired effect –
  making herself “old” – she went about her day. Simple tasks were much, much
  harder. Climbing stairs, dialing a telephone number and opening a refrigerator
  door all represented a challenge.


  Patty continued her experiment for three years. She paved the way for a new
  approach to understanding customers’ needs. For example, if an elderly person
  can’t open a fridge door, perhaps there’s something wrong with the door. Also,
  if a door can be made to open more easily, that will benefit all customers,
  not just the elderly.


  Patty worked with a range of large companies over the years, including Boeing,
  Toyota and Merck. Through her approach, many organizations have learned to
  create products and services that meet unspoken needs. This helps make life
  easier for many.


  The lesson here is that **when we have empathy for others we can uncover
  hidden difficulties and obscure opportunities.** Finding solutions where none
  existed previously can open up new markets, make work meaningful and
  ultimately improve the bottom line.

  ### Stories Not Statistics


  > "The more time you spend with the people you serve, the more the line
  between producer and consumer begins to blur."- Wired to Care, page 164


  If we cannot directly experience what our customers’ lives are like, at least
  we can spend time with them, get to know them and ask what their lives are
  like.


  Mercedes-Benz wanted to make cars that appealed to young Americans. A group of
  twenty executives travelled from Germany to California to meet with innovation
  experts. As Patnaik and his team from Jump were meeting with the executives,
  he mentioned the opportunity they were missing. They had travelled all the way
  to San Francisco, where their desired market lived, and they were spending all
  their time holed up in their hotel.


  At this moment, he opened the conference room doors, to reveal ten men and
  women from the Bay Area. Put together in small groups with the young
  Americans, the executives were able to chat and understand better what their
  lives were like. Some of the insights astounded the Mercedes leaders, such as
  the realization that these affluent individuals didn’t really care about cars.
  Some people didn’t wish to own any car, let alone a luxury vehicle.


  The experience the Mercedes leaders had were far more meaningful than any
  report or market research statistics. They had met with their market and made
  an emotional connection with real people. It created a fresh perspective and
  put faces to their most important stakeholders – real (potential) customers.

  ### Be Your Customer


  > "The simplest way to have empathy for other people is to be just like
  them."- Wired to Care, page 71


  Imagining how someone else feels is much easier when you believe the other
  person is just like you. For companies to have empathy for their customers,
  the best way to do this is to be just like their customers. Better still, to
  BE their own customer.


  When companies become successful, they can lose touch with the large majority
  of the people they serve. Take airlines for example. **How often do airline
  executives fly economy?** How can they really have empathy for the bulk of
  people who buy airfare?


  I recently had yet another horrible experience flying United Airlines. After
  realizing that, in economy, they charge for every checked bag, every beverage
  and the in-flight movies and shows, I tried to relax in my seat. I switch off
  the screen in front of me and turned the volume off. As I started to get
  comfortable, the screen switched back on with full volume, to blare a United
  advertisement in my face. It seemed somewhat ironic, given that the ad
  depicted how much United cares about customers.


  Other companies do a much better job. For example, Harley Davidson hires
  riders. Outside their headquarters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a sign states the
  company’s priorities: “No cages. Motorcycle parking only.” After buying Harley
  back from AMF in 1982, managers set out to reconnect with and hire riders. As
  Lara Lee of Harley said “We don’t think about how we can sell more stuff to
  customers. We think about how we can better serve riders. Because at the end
  of the day, we are them and they are us.”

  _Wired to Care_ creates a strong case for developing Open Empathy
  Organizations. The concept allows all employees to have firsthand knowledge of
  why what they do is important and how they can each add or subtract value.
  Imagine working in such an organization: What you do every day makes a
  difference. You’re creating or supporting products and services that make
  people’s lives better, for people you care about. It’s a compelling vision.

Market research has existed since the 1920s. We’re all aware that companies use focus groups, surveys and product tests to see what customers think of products, services and advertising.

What’s new in _Wired to Care_ is going beyond market research and embracing empathy as a marketable concept. Companies who embrace empathy (or what the author calls Open Empathy Organizations) care deeply about these questions: **What are the lives of our customers like? What do they really want and need?**

Wired to Care shows that companies who adopt this way of working will flourish. It also shows how to develop empathy, through real examples of companies who have succeeded in truly understanding their customers. The book’s author is Dev Patnaik, Principal of Jump Associates, which is a growth strategy firm. Patnaik shares many fresh stories that illustrate concepts of empathy and connecting with customers.

After reading this book, I hope that in the future more and more organizations will realize that empathy will benefit their customers, shareholders and staff. **Empathy means better products, better services and happier employees for everyone.**
