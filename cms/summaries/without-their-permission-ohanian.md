  ### Make the world suck less


  > "The open Internet is not a magic wand, but as a technology it has the
  potential to do tremendous things – to allow awesome people to reach their
  full potential."- Without Their Permission, page 243


  Equality is a beautiful thing.


  We all carry ideas we are passionate about, voices that need to be heard and
  projects that need to spread. **And since we have access to the Internet, we
  have no excuse not to take action.**


  This can be incredibly empowering to some and absolutely frightening to
  others.


  **In an online world that doesn’t require permission, why are some of us still
  waiting for it?**


  The innovators, AKA the Alexis Ohanians of the world, are not waiting. They
  are busy building, connecting and spreading ideas. Every day, more and more
  people are joining this change movement. If you want to avoid becoming
  obsolete, it is time you value your own online freedom, along with your unique
  vision, and do something. **Seriously, do _anything_.** Just make a move.


  Where in the web should you start?

  ### Find people who give a damn


  > "If you’ve had the pleasure of working with an elite team you know what a
  difference it makes. And if you haven’t, you know what it’s like when it’s not
  working. And it’s bad."- Without Their Permission, page 117


  Whether you’re a solopreneur or you lead a growing team, **if you want to make
  the world suck less, you need a kickass support team.** Sure, they need to be
  competent and driven and quasi-entertaining (that’s a plus). But more
  importantly, they need to take pride in their work.


  If your team doesn’t give a hoot about your mascot – _you do have a mascot,
  right?_ – and your mission, you may need to reevaluate your hiring process. As
  Alexis says, **_“hire wisely and fire quickly.”_**


  **Here’s a list of questions Alexis likes to ask potential hires:**


  *   What have you built?

  *   You’ve got a week left to live – we can safely assume I’ve given you the
  week off. What do you do?

  *   What’s the last awesome thing you learned?

  *   If you could do literally anything you wanted for a living, what would it
  be?

  *   What’s your spirit animal? (Calling all zebras!)


  Not only will the questions above give you a chuckle, you will also be able to
  find the people who truly give a damn.


  **The digital revolution is forcing all of us to step up our game, BIG time.**
  It forces us to develop skills that fall outside of our comfort zones. It
  forces us to stop apologizing for high standards and expectations. And it
  forces us to push ourselves, stop making excuses, and **start making the world
  suck less.**


  After all, the open Internet is a gift and an opportunity.


  What will you make?

  ### Learn how to write code


  > "Even if you end up never starting something of your own, the skills you
  learn in development are highly sought after these days."- Without Their
  Permission, page 102


  **What languages do you speak?** Most likely English. Un poco de español. Vous
  peut-être même parler français. But what about one of the most important
  languages of the 21st century?


  We’re talking about the one-and-only language that elevates you from the idea
  person to the power position we call _The Maker_.


  **The Language = Programming.** _(Duh.)_


  If you want to become _The Maker_, you might want to follow these 3 steps:


  1.) **No more excuses, like…** _Programmers are kids, not 35+. I’m too old.
  And I’m not geeky enough to be a hacker. Do I need a snippet of JavaScript
  tattooed to my back first? Oh, and I never attended a computer science class
  in high school._ **Stop with the excuses already.**


  2.) **Develop your arsenal of tools.** If you truly want to operate without
  _their_ permission, then you need to empower yourself. If you’re ready for a
  challenge, take advantage of the growing number of free tools and resources
  available to you:


  *   [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)

  *   [Code.org](http://code.org/)

  *   [Rails for Zombies.org](http://railsforzombies.org/)

  *   [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/)


  Yes, it will take time and a ton of patience to become proficient in HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, etc. but **if you don’t start, you will continue to feel
  frustrated, stalled and even unmotivated.** You might even toss a few
  life-changing ideas in the trash.


  3.) **Stop asking for permission.** Permission is _so_ 20th century.

Let’s kick this party off with a Tweet from the co-founder of Reddit, Alexis Ohanian.

**_RT @alexisohanian:_** _@kirahug @actionablebooks_ **_Woot!_** **_Go make the world suck less_**

Indeed. Go make the world suck less. Consider Alexis your enthusiastic guide into the land of world domination.

_Why should we listen to_ this _guy?_

1.  Sixteen months after Alexis graduated from the University of Virginia, **he sold Reddit to Condé Nast and became a millionaire.**
2.  Alexis founded a social enterprise ([Breadpig](http://breadpig.com/)), launched a travel search engine ([Hipmunk](http://www.hipmunk.com/)), and has invested in more than sixty startups and advised hundreds more.
3.  As an avid proponent in the fight for our open Internet, **Alexis fought against two evil legislative bills – the Top Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA).** He continues to champion the fight for our online freedom. _Alexis, we salute you._

**The open Internet has leveled the playing field.** If you have a connection and a laptop, you can build your ideas exponentially and share your work with the world.

In _Without Their Permission_, Ohanian not only shares his personal story, but also highlights his top lessons learned and a myriad of inspiring stories that will motivate you to **create something awesome.**

If Alexis is living the dream, maybe we all can. Sure, we won’t all become millionaires by the time we’re 25, but we all do have the opportunity to **innovate and disrupt the status quo.**

### The Big Idea

The Big Idea: The biggest takeaway from the book

### Make the world suck less

> "The open Internet is not a magic wand, but as a technology it has the potential to do tremendous things – to allow awesome people to reach their full potential."- Without Their Permission, page 243

Equality is a beautiful thing.

We all carry ideas we are passionate about, voices that need to be heard and projects that need to spread. **And since we have access to the Internet, we have no excuse not to take action.**

This can be incredibly empowering to some and absolutely frightening to others.

**In an online world that doesn’t require permission, why are some of us still waiting for it?**

The innovators, AKA the Alexis Ohanians of the world, are not waiting. They are busy building, connecting and spreading ideas. Every day, more and more people are joining this change movement. If you want to avoid becoming obsolete, it is time you value your own online freedom, along with your unique vision, and do something. **Seriously, do _anything_.** Just make a move.
