  ### It’s All Free, Baby!


  > "To be reading this book, thinking about how to use this great platform, the
  Internet, to share your world-changing ideas, ideally from a comfortable seat
  somewhere, is itself a great luxury."- Without Their Permission, page 39


  We’re fortunate that the internet is a free and open place where every URL is
  accessible from anywhere in the world by anyone who has an internet
  connection. Unless you’re in China or one of the other Communist countries
  trying to censor the internet, ideally it should be a free and open place.
  This gives each and every one of us the opportunity to build something people
  want without huge barriers to entry. Building an online business doesn’t take
  a huge influx of capital – all it takes is $9.99 to buy a domain name
  (GoDaddy.com does it cheap) and to invest some time learning how to create a
  website…all the knowledge you can find for free on the internet with some time
  to invest. The key here is building something people want or need in a way
  that will make lives easier, more enjoyable or just more fun. And to build
  something people want, you just have to start.

  ### Knowledge Is (Almost) Free


  > "These are stories about determined and connected individuals who’ve
  inspired and mobilized people because of a technology that closed the gap
  between inspiration and action."- Without Their Permission, page 172-173


  Ohanian says you can find any information you need on the internet. Sure, you
  have to be selective and think critically about what’s true and what’s not but
  the point is that knowledge is free as long as you take the time to source it
  out. That’s another big aspect of Ohanian’s book – he talks about how to use
  all the resources you can find to teach yourself what you don’t already know.
  Find advisors to teach you about online marketing, angel investors and search
  engine optimization among other topics. For sure, some of these advisors will
  ask you to pay for their time, go to their seminars or buy their sales
  programs but there are also many out there looking to support new
  entrepreneurs and for the price of a cup of coffee, will give you tons of
  great information. These advisors were first-time entrepreneurs themselves and
  many are looking for opportunities to mentor like they themselves were
  mentored once upon a time. You can also find books, blogs and white papers
  that will teach you about writing code and design features for your site and
  many of these resources are available online, completely free.

  ### Just Start It


  > "What are you waiting for? Someone’s permission?"- Without Their Permission,
  page 245


  Okay, so you’ve got an idea that could revolutionize something for someone but
  you’re not confident if it’s just you that thinks it’s a good idea or if other
  people will see the value in it as well. Or, you have an idea and more than
  just your parents and your best friend thinks it’s a good idea, but you’re not
  sure if you can make any money at it. Sound familiar? Ohanian was in that
  place with both reddit.com as well as hipmunk.com so to test his idea, he did
  just that…tested them. He built what’s known as a “Minimum Viable Product”,
  the very basic version of the site that is now reddit.com and hipmunk.com and
  showed it to his friends, colleagues, and other smart (and probably not so
  smart) people to see what they thought. I’m sure his initial concept site
  wasn’t fancy or the most visually appealing but the important part was that it
  demonstrated the service and user flow of information so people could get the
  idea. I’m sure he asked questions similar to:


  *   Was the concept something they could get behind?

  *   Did the functionality and process flow make sense?

  *   Is the product/service something people want?


  He offered up the minimum features and functionality and tested his ideas. And
  then made adjustments based on feedback until he was ready to build what is
  now the end product. But the point is he built it, he started it…didn’t just
  sit around waiting for his idea to be perfect, but went out and made
  improvements to something he’d at least started at the very basic level.
f_conclusion: >-
  The internet has opened up equal opportunity like nothing we’ve experienced
  before. In a free and open internet, there are such small barriers to entry
  that all you need is a good idea that’s also something people want, and some
  dedicated time and energy to bring that idea to life. So just start. Or as
  Ohanian would say, “_Want to make the world a better place? Or, as I like to
  say, just make it suck less? What are you waiting for?_”

Alexis Ohanian has done it all when it comes to the online world. First, he and a buddy started an online business and built it to sell, where it was indeed sold to Condé Nast sixteen months later for an undisclosed sum of money. Undisclosed sum! As in, too much money to talk about! Then, he started another company with this same buddy, as well as another partner who was skilled in sales and made that company into something huge and successful. Now, when he’s not advising to this second company, Hipmunk, he’s a venture capitalist and advising to many, many entrepreneurial ventures around the world. And he’s also petitioning government on behalf of the internet, campaigning to maintain a free and open internet so other people have the opportunity to build and grow other online businesses like he has. Seriously, this guy is my latest role model.

I tell you all this because Ohanian is the topic of this book – or at least the learnings and takeaways from his experience are the topics discussed in this book. For anyone who’s ever started, dreams of starting, or has already sold, an online business, this book will be entertaining and informative for you. Broken up into three sections, there’s really something in this book for whatever stage of the online game you’re in.
