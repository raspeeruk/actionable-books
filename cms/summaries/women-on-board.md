  ### Vision equates success


  > "Great directors go the edge of business issues, openly bringing up the
  unanswered questions, and encouraging discussion… Visionary boards spend time
  on forward looking issues, not just backward looking ones."- Women on Board,
  page 193


  Reading this book has given me a better grasp of the complex world of
  corporate boards. Having a board that performs well and that is visionary is
  quite an accomplishment. A board is a team. It needs to work together and is
  in constant need of nourishment to keep growing. It requires a tremendous
  amount of work to be able to cope with elements that can be local based,
  national or global in nature.


  Being a visionary is key to long-term success. How do you know if a board is
  ‘visionary’, up with the times, and adapted to our changing world? Here are
  few points taken from a list of self-assessment questions to help you find
  out.


  *   **The board governance model:** Keeping the governance model alive and
  well is a big challenge for all boards. Has it evolved? Is it still optimal? A
  board is a team that has to work together to always keep the team strong.

  *   **Risk management:** How does the board assess or supervise risk? There
  are many forms of risk, but dealing with them starts with the question ‘What
  if?’.

  *   **Decision-making:** Does the board have the info it needs to make good
  decisions? Are those decisions made with long term interests in mind?

  *   **Board Performance:** How does it measure its own performance? How is it
  doing?


  As a board member, you can contribute to making a board visionary. It’s
  important to understand and recognize what has been accomplished, but it is
  also very important to look ahead.

  ### You got the job, now what?


  > "You were not chosen randomly… You are there because you have value to give,
  and you were selected because of that value even if you think you don’t have
  the qualifications. So, be confident in your own worth and your own
  knowledge"- Yolanda Auza, Women on Board, page 119


  This book is an invitation to women to step up to the plate and seek
  directorship. It is a guide filled with tips and advice to assist them in all
  the important steps of that journey. But what happens when you get there? What
  do you do? Where do you start? Here is some sound advice:


  *   **Doing a great job starts by being prepared**. Do your homework! Know
  everything about the company and the industry you are now representing. Meet
  the people in the company.

  *   **Learn how the board works**. How is it governed? What skills do the
  other members have? That will help you position yours. Read the minutes of the
  past board meetings. Find out about the finances. Take time to know the other
  board members. Find out from the other members how meetings operate.

  *   **Finding your voice**! The authors strongly encourage board members to be
  authentic and to be a good listener and observer at the initial stages to get
  the feel for the board. That doesn’t mean selling yourself short!

  ### Women on boards is good for business


  > "Putting women board isn’t about ‘feeling good’ or ‘doing good’. It’s
  absolutely great for business."- Fritzi Woods, Women on Board, page 50


  It’s written in black and white that having women on boards is actually great
  for business. In fact, when representation of women on boards is 30% or more,
  a company outperforms those with fewer women on the board. The authors go over
  several reasons why it makes so much sense to have more diverse boards:


  *   It provides a better mix of leadership skills;

  *   An access to a wider pool of talent;

  *   It’s a better reflection of the consumer as more women are responsible for
  household spending decisions;

  *   Improved corporate governance, namely because women are better at
  communicating, prioritizing and considering corporate social responsibility
  and the list goes on.


  Are you ready to sit on a board? Here are a few questions to help you find
  out. If you answer yes to all, you’re ahead of most.


  1.  I have identified the corporation on whose board I wish to serve (and I
  know why);

  2.  I have spent time researching the company and can identify the CEO, CFO,
  COO and current board directors;

  3.  I have identified what value I can bring to the table;

  4.  I am committed to allocating time and preparation for this role.


  The responsibilities of a board member are enormous; the challenge even
  greater for women. As Pernille Sppiers-Lopez, former US President of IKEA
  suggests: “A woman can spend many, many years trying to break the glass
  ceiling and, when she does, she often finds a culture and agenda created for
  men by men. It is often an intense and exclusive culture and not the best
  environment for women to thrive in. It is the same in the board room – we need
  to change the culture in the meeting room as well.”


  With this in mind now, I truly am in awe of women who are sitting on boards.
  Bravo!

  _Women on Board_ is filled with action tips, tools such as the skills set
  matrix and the biography template. There are many quotes and real life
  examples to learn from. We are presented with passages of women (and some men)
  telling us about their true life experiences on boards. This makes the book so
  human and compelling.

  "We need to strengthen the role of women as directors, the performance of the
  companies on whose boards we serve, and the use of best practices in corporate
  governance globally. We need to move together to create boards as they should
  be – multi-gender, multi-skilled, multi-national, multi-ethnic, and
  multi-generational. That’s how we’ll make a difference around the table, in
  the world, and for the world."

Susan Stautberg and Nancy Calderon’s _Women on Board_ is an excellent book. It serves a dual purpose: getting more women to seek leadership positions on boards and making those boards real instruments of change and success for the businesses they serve by being diverse and competent.

Knowing what corporate boards consist of is a key element here. Getting appointed is not an overnight venture; it’s something you want to build towards. Sitting on a board comes with risks and responsibilities. Therefore, you want to make the best choices along the way and once there, you want to be the best you can.

If you are considering board membership, this book will guide you on the path to getting appointed. Great boards bring together people who have “different kinds of competencies, skills, knowledge, professional experiences and personal qualities”. Playing that role is both a privilege and a big challenge. You’ll find that the authors are proponents of making boards visionary and inclusive. Their message is more about diversity!
