  ### In Praise of Muddling Through


  > "The quest for perfection simply must end... Women of the postfeminist years
  have taken this quest to the brink, truly, of madness."- Wonder Women, page
  169


  We women have heaped upon ourselves unprecedented levels of guilt and shame.
  But “feminism wasn’t supposed to make us feel guilty. It was supposed to free
  us.” Sadly, the ability to determine the course of our lives – whether to be
  homemakers or CEOs – resulted not in that promised freedom but in the
  expectation to be both the homemaker and the CEO, the wonderful mother, the
  sex goddess, and the captain of industry. We internalized a lie.


  Rather than returning to the pre-feminist-movement world of limited options,
  we women must end our quest for perfectionism. It’s time to be gentle with
  ourselves and our expectations of what one person can do. It’s time to “stop
  trying to be so damn perfect;” time to accept that real joy comes from letting
  some things go.

  ### Know the Rules


  > "For heaven’s sake, don’t go into a field without first understanding the
  rules of the game and considering deeply whether you want to play by them."-
  Wonder Women, page 200


  One of the keys to balancing the promises of the feminist movement is choosing
  wisely what we really want. Women have achieved equal access in most areas of
  professional life, earning 58% of all degrees in the US, including 50% of
  Ph.D.’s. Sadly, women still earn less than men in similar careers and claim
  roughly 16% (often less) of the highest positions in corporations and
  government.


  And it’s not necessarily because the opportunities _aren’t_ there for women to
  advance. It’s usually the realization that our internal desires and
  expectations clash with the requirements of life at the highest echelons. We
  simply cannot do it all. So let’s be completely honest with ourselves,
  understand the requirements of the careers we seek, and make decisions about
  our personal and professional lives that will lead to fulfillment rather than
  exhaustion.

  ### Women Work Differently


  > "Men in group settings strive generally to preserve status, while women try
  to gain intimacy and closeness. Which means that women can appear to lack
  authority in the workplace – but, also, potentially, that they can be more
  inspiring and transformational leaders."- Wonder Women, page 193


  The feminist movement tried, unsuccessfully, to eliminate all differences
  between the genders. Which is part of the problem – men and women are
  different, in a good way. Generally speaking, women lead differently, work
  differently, and communicate differently. Rather than attempting to “behave
  more or less just like men,” we must understand our differences and the
  strengths that those differences bestow.

  I must admit that this summary has been the most difficult for me to write
  this year – partly because the “actionable” Insights were hidden in the last
  50 or so pages and partly because I am a product of this hyper-perfectionist
  generation of women. I found myself in these pages – trying to be and do it
  all.

Debora Spar’s _Wonder Women: Sex, Power, and the Quest for Perfection_ is a fascinating read, combining an overview of feminist history, an examination of the challenges modern women face, and a few recommendations for making our personal and professional lives more enjoyable.

A solid two-thirds of her book provides the historical context of the modern reality of many women’s lives. Instead of having the freedom to choose our destiny and **be anything**, most women have created for themselves the guilt-ridden requirement to **be everything**. It’s a burden far too great for any of us to carry, and which has resulted in unprecedented levels of depression and substance abuse.

It’s time to “stop trying to be so damn perfect;” time to accept that real joy comes from letting some things go.

I must admit that this summary has been the most difficult for me to write this year – partly because the “actionable” Insights were hidden in the last 50 or so pages and partly because I am a product of this hyper-perfectionist generation of women. I found myself in these pages – trying to be and do it all.

What I found most compelling, however, was the history of the women’s movement. I gained a deeper understanding of the women who came before me and what they hoped to accomplish. I found _Wonder Women_ to be an enlightening and easy-to-read primer on feminism; with a thoughtful examination of the distortion women of my generation have placed on our freedoms. And I remain optimistic for my future, and for the futures of the women in my life.
