  ### Facts are the bedrock of writing


  > "No fact exists without an interpretation of it."- Words for Readers and
  Writers, part 21


  If the author says “the Civil War”, each reader is stormed by a separate set
  of facts. The reader who feels that the North was the aggressor will find
  facts that support that. If the author says “tree”, a different tree will come
  to mind for each reader. Even if the author and the reader agree on a type of
  tree what the reader knows about that type of tree will govern his
  understanding and agreement with the facts. Therefore, we as writers must be
  extremely specific if we want the reader to see what we see. In fiction you
  notice this in sentences replete with adjectives. I run everything I write
  past other people and re-write until I get the understanding I meant them to
  have.


  I found it extremely interesting that Woiwode said that fiction can be more
  factual than non-fiction. We know that factual work (non-fiction) can be
  inaccurate or can even be assembled to deceive (think about the slant placed
  on a news piece) but fiction factual? An example: in one work of fiction a
  person hired by the publisher as a fact checker checked a reference to the
  phrase “the Willet subdivision” in San Jose. They didn’t find one in San Jose
  but did find one in nearby Manito. You’d be better off using a name of a
  subdivision that either didn’t exist anywhere or existed in some other part of
  the country or world than to make the reader think you made a mistake.


  No matter what you’re writing, check your facts or better yet, have someone
  else check them.

  ### Tolstoy’s Writing Process


  > "This is how he \[Tolstoy\] worked as a writer – in interlinked networks of
  accretions."- Words for Readers and Writers, page 81


  Kathryn Feuer researched and wrote about how Tolstoy wrote _War and Peace_.
  She said his mind moved in loops and backtrackings and seismic bursts. He
  started the book four times and each start became an essay. He once started
  another book (_The Decemberists_), stopped and it later became the beginning
  of _War and Peace_.


  Not many of us have use for the word “accretion”. It means the growing
  together of separate things. Tolstoy had lots of notions of the book to be and
  he wrote toward all those ideas at the same time. Part of _War and Peace_ came
  from his experiences and his subsequent thoughts about those experiences. This
  is the perspective from which I write everything from an article to a report
  to a marketing piece to a performance appraisal. I save every proposal (you
  never know what word or sentence-craft you’ll need for some future writing),
  other people’s marketing literature, sentences that occur to me while reading
  other people’s articles. With the reading of them I’m off on an idea for a
  blog post to expand on that idea, find out how others feel, what others do
  about it. Or I love the way the writer put the words together to express an
  emotion that I can apply it to my task.

  ### Woiwode on Writing


  > "Words appear and I’m part of the world again, encouraged to write."- Words
  for Readers and Writers, page 118


  **On writer’s block.** Even if you write for a living (PR, marketing, media,
  management) you can get stuck. Woiwode says he walks around his farm checking
  on things, using a piece of equipment, doing any task but a writing related
  one and his mind is freed. What can you do that’s different than writing and
  is acceptable in your workplace to get your mind off what’s on your computer
  screen? I pack orders.


  **On how long to write in a day.** He drafts for about 4 hours equaling 4-5
  handwritten pages—he believes this to be the limit of the creative process for
  most people—and the rest of the day he works on proofing past drafts and
  correspondence. If you write lots of different things each day, instead of one
  article, one report, one brochure text or one training program – plan to draft
  about half the amount of time you’d allot to that piece of writing.


  **On giving up.** When asked if he’d ever abandoned a piece of work Woiwode
  said he sets it aside if he doesn’t know where it’s going. You may not be able
  to give up on writing someone’s performance appraisal but you could set it
  aside for a day, do something else and when you return the words you need will
  either be there or you’ve researched to find what you need to say to help the
  person.


  **On lying.** Don’t lie. Don’t write anything about anybody you wouldn’t say
  to their face, don’t falsify or slander or libel, don’t distort or gloss over
  what you see. These are the ethics that rest under any form of writing. Though
  it may not seem like lying when I‘m writing the marketing piece, if it’s
  almost universally perceived differently than I meant, it’s likely that I
  distorted or glossed over something. Again, have someone read what you wrote
  to check for factualness.


  **On bad writing.** Qualities that identify bad writing are self-satisfaction,
  inaccuracy that leads to distortion, lack of precision, lack of passion, lack
  of depth, lack of even-handedness, and superficial focus.

  As bread is the stuff of life, so story is the stuff of the spirit and mind.
  When Jesus wanted his disciples to understand something he didn’t launch into
  a fine-tuned theological explanation. He told a story—“A man was traveling
  from Jerusalem to Jericho”—and we are rapt. Make your writing a pleasant place
  for you and the reader to meet and they, too, will be rapt.

> "Words construct personages and place them in phenomenal existence. That’s the primary use of words." _\- Words for Readers and Writers, page 6_

Words equal stories. Stories equal pleasant places where the reader and the writer get to meet. As the reader, I am the medium through which the author actually has a voice. A shared story unites the reader and the listener – as in, without a reader there really isn’t a story.

Reading and writing – that’s what I love to do. _Words for Readers and Writers_ attracted me because it celebrates the durability and the holiness of language. As I’m writing I constantly think, “Now, what will the reader be thinking while they read this paragraph OR what will they do after they read this sentence?” In order to do my job I have to think about how the reader will respond to my writing. Yes, I love the act of writing – the thinking/planning, the research, the paper and pen, the typing. But even more I am captivated by how we use words to fashion meaning for our lives and even identities, and so is the author, Larry Woiwode.

This book is a compilation of essays on the craft of writing but I found them to apply to many other tasks in life. The author writes fiction but I found everything he said to apply to my non-fiction, primarily business, writing. Each essay was commissioned for a magazine or as an introduction to another author’s book but never ended up being used. So we get the benefit all in one place of Woiwode’s deep thinking on how readers read and how writers need to write for them.
