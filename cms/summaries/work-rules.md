  ### Help those in need


  > "What most organizations miss is that people in the bottom tail represent
  the biggest opportunity to improve performance in your company, and the top
  tail will teach you exactly how to realize this opportunity."- Work Rules!,
  page 182


  Despite a recruiting process that is exhaustive and comprehensive within
  Google, there is always a bell curve related to performance. Identifying the
  lower end of performance has historically been identified with dismissal.
  There is a considerable cost to this process, for instance, in Google this
  could potentially mean sacking 20% of employees per annum (equating to the
  lowest 5% per quarter). Instead Google decided on a novel approach.


  Everyone tends to focus on the top performer. However, the bottom needs just
  as much attention and more success can be achieved by increasing the skills of
  the below average. The bottom 5% of employees are identified, and rather than
  taking a possible termination decision, management firstly informs the
  employee where they stand in performance and then offers coaching around
  growth and improvement. Importantly, this discussion occurs outside of any
  performance reviews, and is centered on a growth and improvement strategy.
  Google offers a range of training and coaching to enhance their skills, which
  typically results in a person’s performance increasing to near average levels.
  Bock acknowledges that this may not sound like much, but if an employee was in
  the worst five performers before the interaction and then increased to be
  better that 45 employees after, this procedure would obviously elevate
  performance to be greater than your competitors. However, some employees tend
  to leave and some have to be fired, but the Google approach is direct and
  sensitive to employees’ situations, being totally transparent and allowing
  discussion around improvements. Based on this concept it is pretty hard to be
  fired by Google. The company invests in its people to succeed or a poor fit
  will find meaningful work in another company earlier than might otherwise be
  expected.

  ### Checklist mentality


  > "You have to send out check lists at the right time, make it meaningful, and
  make it easy to act on."- Work Rules!, page 296


  Atul Gawande, a surgeon, developed a simple checklist system in hospitals,
  dramatically reducing complication rates. This simple idea has also been
  applied to other industries such as aviation. Google has implemented this
  concept within the context of nudging. Nudging their employees in order to
  remind them of procedures and follow ups, but also outside of normal
  management, such as security, and health and fitness, for instance. This
  includes check lists, quirky notices in passageways, SMS messages, changing
  food wrappers, the proximity to healthy foods in canteens, etc.


  Bock’s discussion around nudges is enlightening; the implementation is simple
  and easy to achieve once the concept is grasped.


  An excellent example includes a fifteen minute segment in the orientation of
  new employees (Nooglers), providing five actions they can take to be more
  proactive: These are:


  1.  Ask questions, lots of questions!

  2.  Schedule regular 1:1’s (one on ones) with your manager.

  3.  Get to know your team.

  4.  Actively solicit feedback – don’t wait for it.

  5.  Accept the challenge. Take risks and don’t be afraid to fail. Other
  Googlers will support you.


  Two weeks later the Nooglers received a follow-up email reminding them of the
  five actions. Of course, with Google, there are equivalent checklists issued
  to the managers.


  The majority of us are not truly great at being proactive. Focusing on a
  simple nudge at both ends of the employment orientation process has resulted
  in considerable improvement, particularly with employees that scored low in
  proactivity, but also in reducing stress on management.


  Google’s concept is to not trust your gut in human relationships, which
  results in average management systems. In order become better, we need to pay
  more attention and nudge in the right direction. Experiment, experiment more
  and continually measure results.

  ### Founder mentality


  > "The fundamental lesson from Google's experience is that you must first
  choose whether to be a founder or an employee. It’s not a question of literal
  ownership. It's a question of attitude."- Work Rules, page 27


  Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Google’s founders, brought with them not only
  technical brilliance but a belief in the value of education and freedom of
  choice within the context of education. They had both been education in the
  Montessori system.


  Many of the most meaningful and desired people practices were developed early
  in the history of Google. All employee meetings are still exactly that despite
  the huge number of employees, and hiring decisions are made by groups rather
  the individuals. Ownership in stock is offered to all employees. Google is a
  dog friendly organisation. Many other unusual benefits include: free meals,
  access to doctors and washing machines. Talented people are attracted to
  Google because they are focused on achieving an environment where people are
  rewarded, and because it’s a place where autonomy is regularly provided.


  The attitude of ensuring people within the company believe that they creating
  something of high value and are contributing to the world, within the context
  of a founder environment, has ensured that Google remains at the forefront of
  company initiative and creates more and more founders.


  This is a simple solution that can be implemented into any company. One must
  trust and believe in their employees and have the confidence to allow them to
  flourish in a founder environment. Data does not lie; studies illustrate
  comprehensively that companies that empower their employees by taking away
  decision making authority from managers and giving it to individuals and teams
  saw markedly improved results across a study of 308 companies.


  As Bock reminds us, “Treat people like owners instead of machines; machines do
  their jobs, owners do whatever is needed to make the company and teams
  successful”.

  people, read this book. You will be astounded at the simplicity behind the

_Work Rules!_ is unique in many ways. The author, Laszlo Bock, is the senior vice president of People Operations at one of the most innovative and successful companies in the modern world, Google. Bock is genuinely transparent about the company’s success in an extremely competitive market and shares intricate details of Google’s management policies, both pros and cons. The book is a stimulating and exciting read that would be beneficial to any employee or CEO. It is enlightening to learn that Bock has no issue in sharing many of Google’s success policies with the expectation that other workplaces can initiate changes for the better and constantly strive for excellence.

Bock’s posits that there are two types of company organization models that one can work for: firstly the “low freedom” type, or command and control, where employees are micromanaged and worked intensely without consideration, versus the alternative, “freedom driven” company where employees are given voice in how the company evolves and are treated with respect and kindness.

Google, obviously, is highly “freedom driven”.
