  ### Detect Your Phase


  > "If You Can Detect It, You Can Correct It"- Working for You Isn’t Working
  for Me, page 3


  _Detect_ is arguably the most important step in the _Four Ds_ process. In most
  cases, experiencing negative outcomes (i.e. anxiety, frustration) associated
  with an unhealthy relationship can affect our ability to recognize its
  root-causes. With Detect, the authors teach readers how to identify their
  current phase in a toxic relationship and understand how it affects them.


  **Phase 1: Honeymoon Period  

  **Simply put, everyone is on his or her best behavior and early warning signs
  are ignored.


  **Phase 2: Internal Alarm  

  **Ever get the feeling that something is very wrong and you can’t stop
  obsessing about it? This is the Internal Alarm phase. Brought-on by
  experiencing behavior that has left you feeling dismissed and marginalized,
  you categorize it as a “one-off” and decide it cannot develop into an ongoing
  problem.


  **Phase 3: Restart, Try Harder  

  **Surely you were overthinking things, right? This is the phase where you try
  to disprove the “sinking feeling” you experienced in the earlier phase. In
  this phase, you’re putting your best foot forward to live up to your boss’s
  expectations.


  **Phase 4: Disappointment  

  **This is where reality sets in. What you initially conceived as a “one-off”
  in bewildering behavior cements itself as the your boss’s management style.
  Feelings associated with this phase include anger, hurt, confusion, betrayal
  and being let down.


  **Phase 5: Rehearsing and Rehashing  

  **Things don’t make sense. Was it something you did? Did you miss something?
  These questions are reflective of this phase. In this phase you replay your
  interactions with your boss in great detail, which manifests in self-doubt and
  questioning your own sanity.


  **Phase 6: Anger and Blame  

  **The title is pretty indicative of the feelings you’re experiencing in this
  phase and unhealthy coping mechanisms tend to manifest in this phase.


  **Phase 7: Emotional Pain Turns Physical  

  **Do you feel physically depleted and emotionally drained when you deal with
  your manager? In this phase, the emotional turmoil you experience manifests as
  physical ailments.


  **Phase 8: Burnout  

  **You experience an ongoing state of chronic mental, physical and emotional
  pain.

  ### Depersonalize


  > "It’s not about you"- Working for You Isn’t Working for Me, page 112


  This step asks the reader to be introspective. Before embarking on any type of
  self-reflective journey, the authors have two important takeaways for the
  reader:


  1.  Understand that you are not responsible for your boss’s negative behavior.

  2.  Your fears can be triggered because of their behavior.


  Being conscious of these two points helps you to depersonalize and understand
  that the negative behavior is not about you.

  ### Detach


  > "To detach is to separate yourself mentally and emotionally from the
  problematic relationship."- Working for You Isn’t Working for Me, page 58


  The authors describe detachment from challenging work relationships as an
  “ultimate kill”, which requires _Acceptance_ and _Taking Back Your Personal
  Power_.


  _Acceptance_: Described as the most daunting part of detachment, practicing
  acceptance helps you to emotionally detach from and to take a person at face
  value (i.e. your boss).


  _Taking Back your Personal Power_: As described earlier, challenging
  boss/employee relationships can manifest in coping mechanisms with negative
  consequences. This step is about altering the reader’s “go-to” coping behavior
  and controlling impulse actions/decisions. Instead, the authors share at-work
  and after-work exercise for the reader to replenish their energy levels,
  repairing their emotional state, and rebuild their confidence. Some examples
  include exercising, finding a mentor, posting workplace proverbs, etc.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Working for You Isn’t Working for Me_ was an easy read. The authors did a
  great job familiarizing the reader with commonly exhibited coping mechanisms
  and discussing their negative side effects. The book shares pragmatic tips and
  strategies to manage challenging work relationships using illustrative
  scenarios. Applying the _Four Ds_ processis made easy with specific examples
  for commonly exhibited behaviors.

> "Understand that building a better relationship with any authority figure is a process" _\- Working For You Isn’t Working for Me, page 285_

The authors of _Working for You Isn’t Working for Me_ – Katherine Crowley and Kathi Elster – developed a system that helps individuals manage challenging relationships at work. First, the authors explain the most common coping mechanisms that manifest in a challenging work relationship. Next, Crowley and Elster teach the reader a four-step management approach, consisting of self-care and self-management activities and techniques known as the _Four D’s_: Detect, Detach, Depersonalize, and Deal. Each section explains the theory behind each D, and follows up with practical advice on how to apply it in case scenarios.
