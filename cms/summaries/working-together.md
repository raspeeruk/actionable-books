  ### There Is No Silver Bullet


  > "Each of the partnerships profiled in this book illustrates different ways
  of sharing and different styles of working together. It is hardly as simple as
  dividing up power, authority, the spotlight, salary, stock options, and
  success down the middle."- Working Together, page xvi


  It’s human nature to seek the quick and easy path to success. History is full
  of stories about people’s quest for the Holy Grail, the search for the
  fountain of youth, the philosopher’s stone, the proverbial ‘silver bullet’.
  And while there are common elements that can guide us more surely along the
  path to success, the reality is we must alter the recipe to suit our own
  unique strengths, limitations, desires and situations. The same is true for
  creating winning partnerships.


  **That said, there are a few ‘ingredients’ that seem to underpin all
  successful partnerships (or marriages or friendships…).** Consider how well
  you are executing the following behaviours in your current partnerships and
  talk about ways you can strengthen these elements. Or, if you are about to
  embark on a new partnership, use these touchstones as a guide for establishing
  a strong foundation upon which to grow.


  *   **United We Stand** – Do we have each other’s backs? Are we on the same
  page? Are we working in the best interests of the organization?

  *   **Unfailing Belief/Trust** – In the other person, in the vision, in the
  process.

  *   **Shared Values** – A strong moral/ethical code.

  *   **No Secrets** – Candid opinions on issues, no side deals, regular and
  honest communication.

  *   **A Sense of Selflessness** – The willingness to ‘check one’s ego at the
  door’.


  Eisner puts it this way, _“A quality partnership also allows you to recognize
  your own weaknesses, and draw on a partner’s strengths without being
  uncomfortable about the vulnerability.”_

  ### Don’t Stop Looking!


  > "Partnerships all made these people happy, and happier than they would have
  been had they worked for their success alone. They had someone else with whom
  to experience the challenging lows and the ecstatic highs; another person in
  the trenches, another person to pop the champagne."- Working Together, page
  282


  Wow! Who here doesn’t want to be happier in their work and personal lives? Who
  would prefer to organize a party for one (be it of a celebratory nature or a
  pity party)? Who wants to work harder alone rather than alongside others who
  share your dreams and aspirations? I truly hope no hands were raised to these
  rhetorical questions!


  **And yet, finding the right partner for our various dreams and aspirations is
  itself hard work.** Through trial and error I did find my life partner. I have
  not yet experienced the same success in a business context. Sure, there are
  people I like to call on to collaborate on small projects which is definitely
  a win-win. But those are small ‘p’ partnerships and _Working Together_ has
  inspired me to seek a bigger ‘P’ partnership. So I’ll keep looking and
  experimenting, because, according to everyone who has been in a successful
  partnership, “_Working together is much better than working…alone.”_

  ### Two Heads are Better than One!


  > "Two minds, two endurances, two personalities, tied to a common cause
  works."- Working Together, page 278


  If I had a dollar for every time I’ve either heard or used the phrase “two
  heads are better than one” I’d likely be writing this from an idyllic island
  retreat instead of my home office in southern Ontario! We know the adage is
  grounded in truth and we likely have benefitted from implementing it in myriad
  ways in our business and personal lives. And yet, it is generally not our
  dominant modus operandi when it comes to getting things done.


  As Eisner points out, society has had a long-held fascination with solitary
  “heroes” who rise out of nothingness and achieve the impossible; a myth he
  believes has been promoted disproportionately in the media. This has created a
  false perception that if we work hard enough, we can become the next Steve
  Jobs, Jack Welch or J.P. Morgan. So for most of us, the idea of searching for
  someone to work hand-in-hand with us to achieve our aspirations runs counter
  to the way we have been taught to pursue and achieve success.


  As a self-employed consultant and trainer, I live this on a daily basis. And
  while I do collaborate with colleagues on the occasional project and benefit
  from that immensely, I have not (yet) applied the partnership principle to the
  running of my business writ large. I probably need to explore what’s
  preventing me from moving in that direction more deeply and nudge myself to
  create opportunities to ‘partner up’ with others more often.


  I would encourage you to do the same. What are you currently working on that
  could benefit from the skills, talents or perspectives of someone else? **How
  might you create a partnership that leverages your strengths and
  counter-balances your weaknesses?** A wise individual once said to me, “You
  may need to do this yourself, however you don’t need to do it alone.”
  Challenge your assumptions and your ‘regular’ way of doing things. See if you
  can find one small task or project where you can bring in a ‘partner’ and
  benefit from that second ‘head’.

  Ok…so while the book did not provide us with the definitive “Top Ten” list of
  factors or qualities that ensure partnership success, I’m going to ask you to
  help me build one. When you think of the successful partnerships you’ve had,
  what is the one thing you have looked for or valued the most in those
  relationships? What do you think the ‘secret’ to your partnership success has
  been?

> "Does the partnership cause the success, or does the success cause the partnership?" _\- Working Together, page 281_

I’m willing to bet that everyone who is reading this summary can think of examples where a good partnership led to resounding and unimagined success. And we probably can cite examples where success has sustained a rather unlikely partnership. It certainly makes for an interesting “which comes first, the chicken or the egg?” debate, yet this is not the question Michael Eisner sought to answer when he decided to write _Working Together_.

As the title suggests, Michael was curious about discovering what makes successful partnerships work. He has had a number of successful partnerships throughout his career, and by far the most successful one was a 10 year partnership with Frank Wells at Disney (1984-1994). He tells us, _“I spent more and more time wondering exactly why our partnership worked so well, what had actually made that connection so extraordinarily productive and made us so much more successful than we would have been working alone.”_

_Working Together_ explores the nuances of that exhilarating partnership as well as ten other successful business partnerships including: Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger (Berkshire-Hathaway), Ron Howard and Brian Glazer (Imagine Entertainment), Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus (Home Depot), Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken (Restaurateurs, Cookbook Authors, TV celebrities). If you are curious about the backstory to these and other larger-than-life partnerships and what they reveal about creating successful alliances, you will enjoy this book.
