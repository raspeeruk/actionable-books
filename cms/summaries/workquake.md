  ### You CAN Handle the Truth


  > "Many bosses believe employees who interact with them to get work done are
  telepathic... because employees have learned that most bosses react adversely
  when asked to clarify or explain the incoherent request or order they just
  issued, most employees don't ask for any clarification or expectation..."-
  WorkQuake, page 6


  The main theme running through _WorkQuake_ is communication. Which shouldn’t
  be that surprising – communication is something we do constantly and also one
  of the hardest things to do right. Whether it’s communicating bad news,
  issuing or receiving feedback, or innovating new ideas, author Paul Glover
  suggests that communicating with your team, asking them questions, and
  listening to their opinions is the answer.


  In fact, although communication is only a subject of two chapters, it’s a
  theme that runs throughout. Communicating with your team can tell you whether
  recognition is working, whether expectations are realistic, what the rumour
  mill is saying, and ways to improve products or services that only those
  working with customers or products directly would know. **Glover suggests
  scheduling regular 15-minute one-on-one sessions with employees just to talk
  about things**, but he also marks the importance of being present where
  employees are – especially when times are tough. **Your _physical_ presence by
  the water cooler shows that you’re not hiding out** – you’re on the front
  lines just like them.

  ### Learn to Delegate


  > "Surround yourself with the best people you can find, delegate authority,
  and don't interfere."- Ronald Reagan, quoted in WorkQuake, page 133


  This is not the first time someone has suggested the necessity to delegate.
  But Glover focuses not only on why _you_ need to learn to delegate, but also
  on what you are _giving_ to the employee you are delegating to. Make sure that
  the tasks are worth doing (if they don’t need to be done, you really shouldn’t
  be doing them), and focus on delegating tasks that you are good at (because
  you’ll be able to train someone else quickly) and tasks that you aren’t good
  at. Finally, Glover instructs to never delegate “motivating, teambuilding,
  praising, or reprimanding”. **Delegation is not just in clearing off your
  plate** – it’s also in giving others responsibility that allows them to grow.
  It is important when delegating to keep the communication open – by clearly
  communicating expectations beforehand and regularly checking in, you ensure
  success in delegation.

  ### Stop Trying to Teach the Pig to Dance


  > "Stop trying to teach the pig to dance... it's a waste of your time and it
  irritates the pig."- WorkQuake, page 20


  A main theme running through WorkQuake is the reality that not everyone on
  your team _should_ be there – and to try to change those people (to teach them
  to dance) will never be effective. **One of the most powerful and effective
  things that you can do as a leader is to recognize which of your team is “The
  Others”** – those who will not “ever improve their performance, regardless of
  how much time, energy, and resources a company expends on them”. Rather than
  focusing on improving The Others, spend time focusing on Core Employees (the
  portion of the workforce who will always give 100% no matter what) and team
  members with potential (Glover calls these “Temporary” – they’re trying to
  decide whether to be Others or Core Employees.


  **Not sure who on your team is an Other?** Glover suggests that your employees
  do, and communicating with them is the key to figuring it out as well as
  taking action. Once the proverbial cat is out of the bag, Core Employees will
  expect you to take care of the problem of the Others (as Glover suggests:
  awareness + knowledge = expectation). It is important that before taking
  action, you ensure that expectations were clear all along the way, employees
  were trained in meeting these expectations, and employees are rewarded for
  meeting expectations. If this is the case and employees aren’t meeting
  expectations, then they need to go. Glover’s final statement here is key: **if
  a Temporary Employee sees one of The Others not meeting expectations and not
  being reprimanded for it, “it becomes _acceptable_ for them to perform at that
  same low level.”**
f_conclusion: >-
  Regardless of the challenges that you are facing in your organization, you
  will find applicable lessons within _WorkQuake_. Glover’s writing style –
  short, to the point, and often humourous – allows him to say things that many
  other management books don’t have the guts to say.

**The economy has changed and the old ways of managing a team won’t cut it anymore.** That’s the basic premise of Paul Glover’s book _WorkQuake_. Managing from a pedestal, shouting orders without listening to employee feedback – none of those will work anymore.

_WorkQuake_ is an essential book for anyone struggling to figure out the best way to impact their team, anyone trying to figure out why things aren’t working as well as they were, and employees who are trying to figure out how they could do it better. Written in short (often two page) sections, each chapter of _WorkQuake_ focuses on how to fix either an operational issue or a personal performance/productivity issue, and it’s Glover’s writing that really makes this a must read. He writes with humour throughout, speaking from the heart and giving great wisdom.
