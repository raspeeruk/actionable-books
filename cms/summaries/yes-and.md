  ### The greatest improvisers are fantastic listeners


  > "Listen at every level – to the words, the emotions, the intent of the other
  or others. Be completely open to them, bring nothing preconceived or prepared
  to the moment. Listen then speak only to what you’ve heard. Do that, and you
  can’t go wrong."- Yes, And, page 194


  Being a great improviser requires us to master the art of listening. I
  mistakenly believed that great theater improvisers entered the stage with a
  basic agenda; however, _Yes, And_ revealed that the art of the craft is based
  not on pushing preconceived content, but on listening, building on others’
  contributions and sharing the responsibility of moving the scene forward.
  Improvisational listeners arrive prepared, but they quickly let go of ideas
  that don’t work and move in sync with ensemble members, clients and the
  environment.

  ### Become fluent in speaking without words


  > "Improvisational listeners are more effective listeners because they go into
  every conversation looking to build on what the other person offers … they
  understand that their advocacy is grounded in and improved by what is actually
  being said by others."- Yes, And, page 207


  One of the most memorable stories in _Yes, And_ that the authors describe is
  working with an advertising company having difficulty retaining clients. In
  the post-mortem, executives found that their employees lost business because
  they were misreading clients’ signals. To help really hear people, Leonard and
  Yorton suggest refining our ability to read physical cues or micro expressions
  through an exercise called the Gibberish Game. In this exercise, two people
  have an entire conversation in gibberish – made up words and sounds – while a
  third person translates what they are saying by reading their expressions and
  tone of voice. Taking the skills and principles from this exercise, the
  advertising company was able to make a turnaround. By becoming an
  improvisational listener who reads physical cues, we can begin really hearing
  others, even when they don’t articulate feelings or thoughts in words.

  ### Get outside your head


  > "…self-consciousness smothers our ability to communicate effectively. But an
  individual who is steeped in the practice of listening can keep the demons of
  self-doubt at bay when this happens. It allows them to focus on the ideas and
  other people in the room, not on themselves."- Yes, And, page 198


  As a person with type A personality, I revel in thinking ahead, brainstorming
  worst-case scenarios and making contingency plans, partly because I am afraid
  of not having a solution when one is needed most. While improvisation does not
  suggest casting away careful planning, it does insist on letting go of control
  over certain situations and being present. For example, in meetings I am
  guilty of planning my response while colleagues are still talking.
  Improvisation demands that we suspend that kind of distraction and devote our
  full attention to the speaker. Doing so can help lead the dialog to unexpected
  solutions and will signal to others that you value their contributions.


  One of the improvisation exercises Leonard and Yorton suggest to build
  listening skills is called Last Word Response. In this exercise, two
  individuals converse, but each individual’s response must start with the other
  speaker’s last word. The authors give this example:


  Person 1: Boy, I love hot summer days. Can’t wait to go for a run and jump
  into the pool after work.  

  Person 2: Work has been hard lately. I’m really struggling to connect with my
  new boss.


  By needing to hear the last word of your partner’s sentence in order to begin
  your own response, this improvisation exercise forces you to stay in the
  moment and listen all the way through. You can’t check out or craft your
  response because you have no idea how your partner will end the conversation.
f_conclusion: >-
  As a part of my training at business school, my classmates and I participated
  in a Second City Works improvisation workshop. The exercises challenged me in
  the right ways, and _Yes, And_ provides a fantastic overview and extension of
  that improvisational philosophy. The exercises _Yes, And_ contains are
  particularly helpful for leaders to use with their ensembles and for
  individuals to mull over in everyday interactions. Tell us if you’ve loved
  improvisational training as much as I have and how you are still using it in
  practice today.

When most of us think of The Second City, we jump to the famed improvisational theater in Chicago that brought us the likes of Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert and a host of SNL cast members who make us laugh every week. We certainly do not readily associate the work of The Second City with business skills; however, in _Yes, And_, executives from The Second City, Kelly Leonard and Tom Yorton show us how improvisation is an essential element in building successful businesses today. Improvisation spurs creativity by building on individual contributions, being open to ideas, leveraging strengths of the ensemble, listening and knowing when to follow. Throughout the book, the authors share improvisational exercises that can help us excel in uncharted circumstances and create a masterpiece from scratch.
