  ### Gazing up at the sky


  > "Persuasion is a science."- Yes!, page 5


  Studies show what works, but many don’t apply it. If we look into these
  studies and understand what they mean for us, we’ll be able to persuade our
  children to do their homework, convince the boss of the value of our
  suggestions and sell more easily to our clients.


  Why don’t we take more advantage of these studies? Perhaps we’re following the
  principle of social proof, which tells us that we look to what others do to
  guide our behavior.


  Social proof is a powerful concept. Research scientist Stanley Milgram
  conducted a study in New York City, whereby one man (an actor) stopped and
  looked at the sky for 60 seconds. He was largely ignored. When four more
  actors were added, gazing into the sky, the number of people who stopped to
  see what they were looking at quadrupled.


  How can this idea be used elsewhere to convince others to take action? Hotels
  want people to reuse their towels and almost all hotels use the same message
  on small cards in the guests’ rooms: reusing your towels helps the
  environment. But, are environmental benefits as persuasive as social proof?
  The results are in: when the sign mentioned instead that most people who had
  stayed in that hotel reused at least one towel, participation increased by
  26%.


  What other concepts can we apply to be more persuasive?

  ### To persuade others that you're competent, admit when you're wrong


  > "…if you play the blame game, pointing your finger at external sources,
  rather than yourself, both you and your organization will likely end up as the
  losers…"- Yes!, page 110


  We often see examples of organizations refusing to apologize and accept
  responsibility for their mistakes. Perhaps it’s a fear of admitting liability
  and becoming open to expensive lawsuits. However, when a company or an
  individual fails to take responsibility when things go wrong, they are missing
  an opportunity to be seen as credible and competent.


  Social scientist Fiona Lee conducted a study in which participants read
  reports about a fictitious company. Two reports were produced. Each report
  contained information that the company had produced poor results over the
  previous year. Report A cited internal factors, such as management decisions
  and investments in new products, while Report B blamed external factors such
  as the economy and competition. Participants who read Report A rated the
  company more positively on a number of factors than those who read Report B.


  It takes humility and bravery to admit when we make mistakes. It often feels
  easier to blame external circumstances: the weather, the economy, the
  government. Blaming outside circumstances doesn’t work, because we’re implying
  that we don’t have control over the situation or the ability to fix it.


  There’s a simple (but not necessarily easy!) way to apply this, both
  personally and professionally. When you’ve made a mistake, say you’re sorry.
  Apologize quickly and clearly, taking responsibility and looking at what you
  can do differently next time. Though it can be tough to admit when you’ve
  failed, the overall effect is that you’re more likely to be seen as someone
  who is competent and in control.

  ### To make more sales, offer fewer choices


  > "What could possibly account for this tenfold increase in sales?"- Yes!,
  page 26


  This was an eye-opener. We tend to believe that the more choices we have, the
  happier we’ll be. However, having to analyze and weigh up multiple options is
  time-consuming. We feel frustrated and confused. Often, we’ll end up simply
  choosing nothing.


  The jam experiment (as outlined in more detail in our summary of [_The Art of
  Choosing_](../summaries/the-art-of-choosing/) and our interview with [_Sheena
  Iyengar_](../videos/all-about-choice/)_)_ involved a display at an upscale
  supermarket, featuring either 24 or 6 different jams to taste. When 24 options
  were available, only 3% bought jam. When 6 options were available, 30% of
  those who approached the display bought jam – a tenfold increase! More is not
  always better, when it comes to choices.


  Procter & Gamble applied this concept to their benefit: they reduced the
  number of Head and Shoulders varieties from 26 to 15. This resulted in a 10%
  increase in sales!


  Are we giving our clients too many choices? The lesson here is to make it easy
  for clients and customers to buy from us, by offering a sensible number of
  products or services.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are so many useful tips in this book; it was difficult to choose just
  two gems. Each of the 50 methods is a gem on its own. With just three clearly
  written pages for each tip, it’s easy to dip in and out. Over 2 million people
  have benefitted from the work of Robert Cialdini and his co-authors – pick up
  a copy of _Yes!_ so you can too.

_Yes!_ features 50 ways to be more persuasive, with examples and research to prove and demonstrate each point. The book, written by Noah J. Goldstein, Steve J. Martin, and Robert B. Cialdlini, expands on Cialdini’s work, originally detailed in his book _Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion_. The six universal principles of Cialdini’s previous book are included: reciprocity, authority, commitment/consistency, scarcity, liking and social proof. New concepts are featured and each idea is followed with a straight-forward suggestion of how to apply the concept, both personally and professionally. _Yes!_ is both easy and fun to read.
