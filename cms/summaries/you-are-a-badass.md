  ### It's time to tap into the badass that I am...


  > "Getting clear about what your unique purpose is can be the difference
  between living a happy, fulfilled life of abundance, choice, and expansiveness
  or living in the restrictive veal pen of your own indecision and tired old
  excuses."- You Are a Badass, page 71


  When you tap into your purpose and go at it full force, you are bringing
  beauty into the world. When you hold back and let fear and naysayers get the
  best of you, you are being selfish. People will no doubt freak out when you
  tell them your big plan. In their defense, they are looking out for your best
  interests (as best as they know how). And yes, it won’t always be easy. In
  fact, it may seem as if all odds are against you. However, Sincero reminds us
  that “Instead of taking this as a sign that you shouldn’t have \[made that
  decision to follow your dream\], take it to mean that you’re ridding yourself
  of your BS and moving in the right direction”. Sincero calls BS the “Big
  Snooze”. The BS will do anything to stop you from stepping into your new
  identity. It will do anything to stop you from growing and changing beyond the
  person that everyone one is used to. So instead of crawling back into our
  shells when something happens that is against our plans, remember the WHY in
  our decisions and actions to be greater. Remember that it is better to live
  your purpose than to live a life of misery and regret. Decide today to step
  into your badassery and own it!

  ### Start believing


  > "Your thoughts and beliefs dictate your reality, so if you want to change
  your reality, you have to change your beliefs."- You Are a Badass, page 94


  Start believing that you CAN do it. Start believing that you CAN achieve your
  wildest dreams. Put your energy and focus on the ability to achieve versus the
  inability to do so. Whatever thoughts you give energy to is where energy will
  go and will in turn manifest itself. So, why not manifest what you want
  instead of what you don’t want. “The moment you have the audacity to start
  believing in the not-yet seen, your reality will begin to shift,” Sincero
  writes. Don’t worry about _how_ something is going to happen. Don’t worry
  about _where_ the money is going to come from. Don’t worry about _who_ is
  going to give you that chance. Just know _what_ it is that you want, imagine
  yourself already having it (or being it or doing it), and believe that it WILL
  happen.

  ### Love yourself


  > "Be grateful for all you are and all that you're becoming."- You Are a
  Badass, page 120


  In order for us to tap into our true selves – our badassery – we must love
  ourselves. We must be grateful for everything about who we are, even those
  things that we don’t tend to care for.


  We have the tendency to allow outside opinions to shape the opinions we have
  about ourselves. It’s time to get away from the naysayers and stop beating
  ourselves up with negativity. Instead of investing in believing we’re not good
  enough, we need to invest in self-love. Sincero suggests these 9 ways to “win
  yourself over again”:


  1.  **Appreciate how special you are** – No one can do it like you! Even
  someone with the same talent or gift as you will never be able to deliver it
  exactly like you. It’s your uniqueness that will draw people to you like no
  other.

  2.  **Drown yourself in affirmations** – Instead of filling your mind with
  negativity, fill it with positive words and sentences (i.e.: I am enough, I am
  beautiful, I deserve happiness).

  3.  **Do things you love** – Take care of yourself. You might as well enjoy
  the life that you’re living. Don’t think of it as being selfish. Remember, you
  can’t fill someone else’s cup from an empty cup.

  4.  **Find a replacement** – Notice your thought patterns and behaviors and
  replace any negative ones with positive thoughts and behaviors.

  5.  **Ditch the self-deprecating humor** – Self-explanatory.

  6.  **Let the love in** – When someone compliments you, accept it and just
  say, “Thank you”.

  7.  **Don’t compare yourself to others** – Just don’t.

  8.  **Forgive yourself** – Guilt, shame, and self-criticism are destructive;
  forgive yourself so you can move on.

  9.  **Love yourself** – Period.

  _You Are a Badass_ reminded me to stop doubting my greatness. It reminded me
  of all of the things that have held me back from being the best version of
  myself. I can definitely see using this book as a reference as I coach
  clients.

You are a badass! No ifs, ands, or buts. Just accept it and be great at it! Jen Sincero successfully shows her readers how to tap into their badassery in _You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life_. We all are equipped with our own unique talents, gifts, quirks, etc. Each of those things are what makes us unique. Sincero quotes Kurt Cobain: “Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.” This is so true. We are put on this earth for a reason and for that reason we should embrace who we are and share it with the world. What I love about this book is that Sincero gives step-by-step instructions and best practices on how to tackle some of the main hang-ups that tend to hold us back. The last step in every one of them is: “Love yourself.”
