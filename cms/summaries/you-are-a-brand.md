  ### It’s all about perception


  > "We’re all entrepreneurs today, whether we work for a company or work for
  ourselves… Take charge of your brand, or someone else will…"- You Are a
  Brand!, page 11


  You’ve heard some folks say that they don’t care about what other people say
  about them. They should, because perception is everything when it comes to
  brand. Self-branding will help you take control of how you are perceived by
  others and tip perception in your favour.


  It used to be that only companies developed their brands. Brands have a
  distinct look and feel. Brands get noticed and purchased. Brands are better
  than generic products. This is the perception. I, myself, am not immune to the
  tyranny of brand perception. For the longest time I would not buy a generic
  bottle of Ibuprofen. I would always reach for Advil.


  If you’re an entrepreneur, branding your business and self-branding are key
  things you must do. But what about careerists who work for companies? Should
  you self-brand, too? The answer is yes, you should. The author cites several
  stories of clients passed over for a promotion for various reasons: higher ups
  having an out-dated understanding of the person’s work but doesn’t know her
  recent accomplishments. Another client was constantly being excluded from
  important meetings even when she did all the work. It turned out that she was
  not in sync with the corporate dress code. Between her demeanor and her
  appearance, she was perceived as not presentable, but also not promotable.


  It isn’t just about the hard work or the great work you do. If no one knows
  about them, then they don’t count.


  There are certainly elements in this book which remind me of [_Brag! The Art
  of Tooting Your Own Horn without Blowing
  It_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/brag-the-art-of-tooting-your-own-horn-without-blowing-it/)
  by Peggy Klaus. Why? Because creating awareness of your skills and
  accomplishments is an integral part of self-branding. It’s essential in
  creating and managing others’ perception of Brand You.

  ### Don’t market yourself as a generalist. Create a niche for yourself.


  > "Being jack-of-all trades is not a smart strategy. It is smart to be an
  expert in one area. Focus is powerful…The narrower the focus, the more
  powerful the brand."- You Are a Brand!, page 62


  This might be one of the toughest things you’ll do in your journey to
  self-brand. You might have years of experience working in different aspects of
  the business. Narrowing it down to one thing seems, well, limiting. What if we
  alienate other prospects and the opportunities they bring? Once you understand
  your target market, this will be easier to do. Strategizing and narrowing your
  focus will showcase your strengths and will differentiate you from your
  competitors. There are ten self-brand strategies you can play with to see
  which fits you the best:


  1.  **The Innovator**: You’re the first person who \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert
  claim to fame here). Think Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.

  2.  **The Leader**: You’re a leader in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (industry, job function,
  basis of leadership claim). Think Warren Buffet.

  3.  **The Maverick**: You are the opposite of the established leader
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (insert name). Whatever the leader stands for, you stand for
  the opposite. Think Tony Hsieh of Zappos.

  4.  **The Identifier**: You are known for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (list attribute). Own
  an attribute which will become a buzzword synonymous with you. Think BMW for
  driving performance.

  5.  **The Engineer**: You developed \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ special ingredient or
  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ new process. Think Tony Horton of P90X.

  6.  **The Expert**: You are an expert in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

  7.  **The Client Advocate**: You are preferred by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (target
  audience).

  8.  **The Elitist**: I’m hard to get, expensive and worth it. Good to use once
  you’ve achieved a certain status in your field or if you’ve been endorsed by a
  celebrity.

  9.  **The Heir**: You’re the best because of your \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ heritage.
  Think about your national origin, prestigious school or a stint at a
  well-known company.

  10.  **The Crusader**: You are synonymous with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (cause). Think
  Blake Mycoskie of TOMS shoes.

  ### Know yourself and the market place


  > "That person in the mirror is the only one you can rely on. But that’s not
  sad. It’s powerful."- You Are a Brand!, page 17


  Before you can market yourself, you’ll need to do a personal inventory to
  understand your assets that lead to success. Your goal is to align your
  strengths to market opportunities. Catherine Kaputa provides tools to help you
  define your brand idea and promise to prepare for building your brand
  strategy, including the classic USP: Unique Selling Proposition, which is
  defined as: “The distinctive idea that brands are always searching for – a USP
  provides a compelling value proposition that resonates with the target
  audience.”


  She also makes use of the SWOT Analysis – identifying your strengths and
  weaknesses. These can be skills, experiences, accomplishments and personality
  traits. Weaknesses could be things you’re not good at or don’t enjoy doing.
  Opportunities and Threats are extrinsic to you. What’s happening in the
  business? In the industry? With change comes opportunities.
f_conclusion: >-
  There are other Insights in _You Are a Brand_, and underpinning all of them is
  authenticity. Be honest with yourself about what you’re great at, what you
  enjoy doing, what you dream of doing. Then go and use this book to create and
  live that dream. I enjoyed reading this book and am already working on a plan
  to re-launch Brand Me.

Catherine Kaputa’s second edition of _You Are a Brand!_ is an essential guide for both careerists and entrepreneurs alike. This book is for anyone looking to differentiate themselves in the marketplace, for those who are employed and those unexpectedly unemployed. It is for those who need to rebrand after a setback, and those who would like to elevate their game.

The author communicates how to create your own personal brand with similar processes and tools that a company or ad agency uses to brand and rebrand, applying the same principles to create Brand You to get noticed in the real and cyber world. She incorporates useful concepts that you may have already come across, such as making ideas stick ([_Made to Stick_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/en-ca/summaries/made-to-stick/) by Dan and Chip Heath), to mention one. She also includes vintage concepts in business, such as the SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats), USP (unique selling proposition), crafting your elevator speech, and how to network. She doesn’t leave anything to chance! Kaputa provides tips on “visualizing your brand” which is all about how you dress, how you show up, how you sound. Everything has to align to the personal brand you’re creating, including your business card and online persona.

You’ll find that there are certainly more than two Insights in this book that you could apply to effectively self-brand and land that dream job!
