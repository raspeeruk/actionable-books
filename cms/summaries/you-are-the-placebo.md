  ### You Can Create a New Body and Life


  > "You have to finally see your old, limited beliefs for what they are –
  records of the past – and be willing to let go of them so you can embrace new
  beliefs about yourself that will help you create a new future."- You Are the
  Placebo, page 165


  Dr. Joe’s personal journey began shockingly at just age 23. During the biking
  portion of a Palm Springs triathlon, he was run over by an SUV barreling along
  at 55 miles per hour. Never even saw the vehicle coming… Doctors insisted he
  undergo devastating Harrington rod spinal surgery or face sure paralysis.


  Contrarily, he embarked upon an “inward reconstruction”. In so doing, he
  proved his book’s sub-title, _making the mind matter_. Essentially, if a given
  (healing or beneficial) gene has been previously expressed by the body – but
  then turned off due to stress or illness – we can turn it back on. New genes
  can be instructed to behave in new ways.

  ### Think Greater than You Feel


  > "Use elevated emotions to drive you into a new future."- You Are the
  Placebo, page 136


  We shouldn’t merely avoid negative emotions like fear or anger. Rather, we are
  encouraged to cultivate heartfelt emotions like appreciation, joy, excitement,
  fascination, awe, inspiration and kindness. Over time, your sub-conscious mind
  and body begin to believe your preferred future has already occurred.


  To begin to manifest what you DO seek:


  *   Be thankful in the present moment; gratitude is the ultimate state of
  receivership

  *   Express internal appreciation even before outer shifts happen

  *   Add to these emotions clarity as to your positive intentions; be
  optimistic

  *   Think back to when you have successfully changed in the past


  For me, the uplifting effect of Dr. Dispenza’s tediously-won lessons is this:
  I can absolutely bring a new future into concrete material existence by
  changing my belief and perceptions at a biological level. What power!

  ### Cross the River of Change


  > "Ninety-five percent of who you are by the time you’re 35 years old is a set
  of memorized behaviors, skills, emotional reactions, beliefs, perceptions, and
  attitudes that functions like a subconscious computer program."- You Are the
  Placebo, page 71


  As Dispenza declares, the hardest part about change is not making the same
  choices we made the day before. Did you know 90% of today’s thoughts are the
  same ones we had yesterday? Indeed, we cannot create anything new from the
  known.


  Goodness! The conscious mind’s 5% capacity is constantly working against the
  95% of unconscious programs we’ve memorized for years. Your (unconscious) body
  remembers each negative ever harbored. To change will feel like swimming
  upstream.


  Literally, cravings (to return to old ways) are withdrawals from the body’s
  familiar chemical-emotional addictions. However, if we can understand our
  discomfort is “simply” the biological, neurological, chemical and even genetic
  death of the old self, we have greater power over change.


  Some call this experience the dark night of the soul. The author terms this
  necessary process the phoenix igniting itself and burning to ashes. To get
  started, here are some suggestions:


  *   Stop analyzing and over-thinking your life on the basis of any current
  stressful or negative emotions; this keeps you anchored to the past

  *   Avoid judging yourself; otherwise, you’ll never enter the operating system
  of your mind to reprogram old patterns

  *   Stop anticipating that negative past events will recur; expect the best

  *   Get out of your own way!
f_conclusion: >-
  Our genes do not doom us. We _can_ modify our destiny by turning on the genes
  we want and turning off those we don’t want. Changes in human consciousness
  produce physical changes, both in structure and function, in the human body.

> "What reality do you choose to live?" _\- You Are the Placebo, page 123_

Is it possible to heal by thought alone – without drugs or surgery? Yes! In _You Are the Placebo_, Dr. Joe Dispenza shares numerous documented cases of those who reversed cancer, heart disease, depression, crippling arthritis and even Parkinson’s tremors. Similarly, he recounts how others have fallen sick and even died the victims of a hex or voodoo curse – or after being misdiagnosed with a fatal illness. Such is the power of belief.

I for one cannot wait to hear what else we discover about epigenetics, neuroscience, biology, psychology, and quantum physics. It appears the seemingly impossible is becoming ever-more possible.
