  ### Focus to Finish


  > "Do as much as you can, with as much of your focus as you can, toward
  completion, in the next few minutes."- Your Best Just Got Better, page 187


  Womack states that out of all the aspects of productivity and workplace
  performance he teaches in this book, “focus is the single most critical
  component to address when it comes to success.” And he does teach a lot of
  different concepts, including how to manage your time, your energy, improving
  your network, gathering feedback, and clarifying your purpose, among others.
  But when he gets to the chapter on focus, you get the feeling that this is his
  secret sauce, his baby.


  He calls it, **Directed Thinking**, when you are focused on thinking toward
  what you want to be true. This is beyond positive thinking, it’s more about
  “directing your focus forward, taking action, and making things happen.” And
  that’s exactly what you’ll be able to do after acting on the concepts in this
  book.


  In a world of constant multi-tasking and increased demands on our time that we
  either place on ourselves, or is placed on us by others, we crave some kind of
  magical time and space where the rest of the world just stops, so we can focus
  on getting things done and catch up. Well, we’re not going to find that
  magical place where we stop the world, but we can, in essence, block out the
  rest of the world mentally, as we focus on our most important tasks. Our job
  is to create our own time and space, and not wait for the world to give us
  permission, because frankly, it doesn’t care.


  Staying focused on not only your everyday tasks, but on the direction of your
  life is the key to getting better.

  ### If you can track it, you can change it


  > "Until you notice what you do, you don’t notice what you do."- Your Best
  Just Got Better, page 113


  Tracking creates awareness. Jason says that this is the secret ingredient to
  making positive, iterative, and sustainable change. The best way to change
  habits is to first identify those that are already in place. There are all
  kinds of things you can track, but the difficult part is turning a true mirror
  on yourself. Try tracking some of the following items:


  *   How many times were you interrupted?

  *   What time did you arrive?

  *   When did you take a morning break?

  *   How many minutes (or hours) did you spend away from your desk in meetings?

  *   What time did you leave for home?

  *   What time did you go to bed?


  If you don’t know the answers for sure, then you have all the more reason to
  start tracking. Understanding your current reality is key to any kind of
  change management effort.

  ### Practice on the small things, so you can perform on the big ones


  > "Think about what you have to do, and do something you’re thinking about."-
  Your Best Just Got Better, page 209


  Sure, we’ve heard ‘practice makes perfect’ all our lives, but Jason is going
  deeper. He says that ‘practice makes comfortable.’ So think about all the
  things you’re comfortable doing, that means you’ve practiced them. For
  instance, someone who has perfected the art of always being late to meetings
  has ‘practiced’ that behavior over and over until it has become a standard
  habit. We can practice something whether it’s right or wrong.


  He says “the easiest way I know to get started doing things differently is to
  begin slowly, and practice with incredible intention and deliberate focus.”
  This equates practice to being more like an experiment. In an experiment, you
  are just trying something and seeing how it works. But you are focused on
  observing exactly what happens. Regardless of whether it does or doesn’t work,
  you’ve still learned something just by conducting the experiment and observing
  intently. So by practicing a new way to act, you’re just seeing how it works
  for you. And if you do it a few days in a row (usually 5) you’ll have a better
  idea whether you should keep practicing or try something else.


  Here are a few examples of what Womack’s clients have decided to practice:


  1.  Saying no

  2.  Maximizing interruptions

  3.  Managing meetings

  4.  Following through on every commitment


  He goes into more detail about each of these items and also shares 3 keys to
  effective practice: (1) visualization, (2) rehearsal, and (3) the five-day
  experiment.


  We know deep down that if we want to get better, we need to practice. So why
  don’t we just do it?

  tools that you can act on right away, then read Jason Womack’s _Your Best Just
  Got Better_ slowly and follow his instructions.
