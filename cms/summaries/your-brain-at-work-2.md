  ### Prioritizing – one of the brain’s most energy hungry processes


  > "If Emily knew how energy-hungry her \[Prefrontal Cortex\] was, she would
  start her Monday morning prioritizing."- Your Brain at Work , Act 1, Scene 2


  The Prefrontal Cortex runs conscious thought – understanding, deciding,
  recalling, memorizing, inhibiting. With all this, as you can imagine, it
  requires significant resources to operate. The resources are glucose and
  oxygen and the Prefrontal Cortex chews up a lot of them. A study was done that
  showed how much harder any task is after you complete a difficult one. After
  just a few mental activities you may not have enough energy to prioritize. But
  people who drank something sugary found a marked improvement in their
  performance.


  Instead of the weight gain and dental bills that go with the sugar fix, I’ve
  already started doing the most energy intense thing first – prioritizing.
  Before I would just take the first task on the pile. In addition there are
  other easy to implement things that will reduce the amount of energy the
  Prefrontal Cortex takes to operate:


  *   language takes more energy to hold information than visuals, so **think in
  visuals** instead of words

  *   save your Prefrontal Cortex for the most important functions by **writing
  things down** instead of manipulating them only in your mind

  *   plan recovery time by putting **high energy consumption tasks together**.
  Then when you move to the low energy tasks it’s a break for the brain
  (compared to mixing it up all day and never getting a substantial break).

  ### Hot buttons


  > "'Minimize danger, maximize reward' is the organizing principle of the
  brain."- Your Brain at Work, Act 2, Scene 7


  I would never have thought this section of the book would have been important
  to me based on its title – “Derailed by Drama” – but it helped me understand a
  response I’ve been having a lot lately that’s apparently controlled by my
  Limbic System. The Limbic System encompasses several parts of the brain and
  has as one of its main functions the responsibility to continuously make
  _toward_ and _away_ decisions – causing us to move away from things that
  threaten us and toward things that reward us.


  The hot buttons that trigger my Limbic System _away_ response right now are
  asking me to serve on a board, do something early in the morning (water ski
  time), do something social more than two nights a week, do something with
  people who whine and complain. The _away_ response causes over arousal of the
  Limbic System and whether the threats are real or imagined, when it’s over
  aroused the resources available for Prefrontal Cortex functions are reduced.
  At the same time the Limbic System is pumping out increased amounts of
  hormones like Adrenaline and Cortisol. You can see the problem here – if
  you’re asking me to serve on a board I will forget the really good reasons to
  not be on the board, get flustered and just say “no” in a less than
  appropriate tone, then back-peddle as I hear the tone and make it worse and
  worse. That’s why after this happens to us we think later of all the things we
  should have said that would have made the other person feel better about our
  “no”.


  What can we do? Trying not to feel the emotion doesn’t work because this
  action uses valuable Prefrontal Cortex resources causing us to make even more
  mistakes in what we’re doing or saying. Lucky for us it’s not just the Limbic
  System that gets aroused. Increasing arousal in the Prefrontal Cortex takes
  away resources from the Limbic System! We can increase arousal in the
  Prefrontal Cortex when we feel a strong emotion by stopping to put a word or
  two to describe how we feel – frustrated, overwhelmed, angry. This labeling is
  a Prefrontal Cortex function and it allows us to get control of our feelings
  because it stops the Limbic System _away_ response. Even better is that over
  time and with practice labeling our emotions can become automatic i.e. no
  longer using the resources of the Prefrontal Cortex.

  ### You can really only process one thing well at a time


  > "While it is physically possible sometimes to do several mental tasks at
  once, accuracy and performance drop off quickly. The consequences can be
  harsh."- Your Brain at Work, Act 1, Scene 3


  I so don’t want to believe this but the evidence and research is overwhelming.
  Yes, it depends on what you’re doing – if I’m cooking dinner I can do more
  than one thing at a time and not impact performance as much as if I’m doing
  complex math and talking to a staff member about his performance. Really? When
  I do several things t once the food is rarely cooked exactly right or looks
  exactly right compared to when I do one thing at a time.


  Prefrontal Cortex processes, in addition to using an incredibly large amount
  of energy, also involve the complex manipulation of billions of neurological
  circuits. Many processes even use the exact same circuits! It’s like expecting
  a calculator to multiply and divide using the same keys at the same time.


  But in today’s world people expect you to do more than one thing at a time –
  _and you can_ if you take a lesson from ball jugglers. Jugglers throw the
  balls up and catch them over and over until it becomes “embedded” in the Basal
  Ganglia, instead of being managed by the Prefrontal Cortex. Driving is the
  perfect example: you embed holding the wheel, then embed using the accelerator
  and brake, then embed parking, etc. That’s why I can listen to a book on tape
  or the GPS or a passenger and answer their questions and still drive. I’ve
  started listing tasks that I do that are already embedded and planning to do
  them at the same time I do another embedded one. Thus saving energy for the
  new, not embedded tasks.
f_conclusion: >-
  Everything boils down to the abilities and the limitations of the Prefrontal
  Cortex. This book will (I know you’ve heard this before, but this time it’s
  for real) _really_ change the way you do everything if you work towards those
  abilities. I can already see a change in my completion of tasks. It’s very
  reinforcing!

> "It’s only by knowing your brain that you change it." _\- Your Brain at Work, Introduction_

You can be more productive, be cool under pressure and influence others by learning how the brain works and acting on that knowledge. Sounds like a textbook read from Psych 101, right? Not this book. It’s regular, everyday language with the points exemplified through the story of two people at work. You get to watch them do a task alone or with others _before_ they understand how their brain works (it’s not a pretty sight) and then again after (much more successful). Over thirty neuroscientists from all over the world explained why they struggle with their email or their colleagues or their schedules or change and then, using what they know about how the brain works, saw what they could have done differently. David Rock culls it all into easy to implement ‘Things to Try’ in each circumstance and allows us to see the fix at work in the story of the two people.

I was thrilled to see this model as it’s how our company helps people learn any task: first understand what’s happening in your brain when you’re doing something and then use that to think in the most effective manner to complete the task successfully.
