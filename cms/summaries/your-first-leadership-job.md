  ### What Makes a Great Leader?


  > "Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you
  become a leader, success is all about growing others."- Jack Welch, Your First
  Leadership Job, page 17


  DDI calls great leaders, **catalyst leaders**, which again, is defined as
  leaders that have a knack for building engagement, involving others and
  capitalizing on people’s strengths and diverse viewpoints. There are common
  characteristics that make up a leader like this and they are:


  _Asks and listens, fosters innovation, provides balanced feedback, builds
  trust, focuses on people’s potential, collaborates and networks, empowers
  others, encourages development, energizes and mobilizes and aligns actions
  with strategy._


  Leadership is a large responsibility that requires a lot of an individual. I
  love this list because it gives us a holistic overview of what all a
  leadership role encompasses. While, I’ll admit, it’s a bit overwhelming, it is
  extremely helpful to see it laid out in black and white. I would recommend
  reviewing this list to self-assess what areas you currently excel in and what
  areas you can improve.


  DDI surveyed over 1,200 employees and asked the question: _What differentiates
  the best boss from the worst boss you ever worked for?_ Unfortunately, only 22
  percent said they are currently working for their best boss ever. And as you
  might have expected, they rated their best bosses as three times more likely
  to use and exhibit catalyst behaviors.

  ### Bring Out the Best in People


  > "Great leaders know that their success relies on the success of the people
  they lead."- Your First Leadership Job, page 35


  The best leaders have the ability to make those around them better, and they
  know that their personal success relies on the success of the people they
  lead. Just like a coach does in sports, it’s a leader’s responsibility to
  enhance their team member’s skills, abilities, and interests. This win-win
  mentality also helps to create a collaborative, engaged culture which will
  make the workplace more enjoyable for all.


  Here are some suggestions from the authors on what to do to bring out the best
  in your people:


  *   Encourage them to try new things

  *   Cultivate and optimize others’ talent and capabilities

  *   Take the time to find out what motivates your team and then assign work
  that is in line with their skills and interests

  *   Compliment people on their efforts

  *   Give people input on the things that affect them

  *   Trust in the strength of others

  *   Allow them to safely learn through failure

  *   Unite others towards common goals

  ### Be Authentic


  > "The people who now report to you will form an early judgement about your
  leadership capabilities that will define your reputation in ways that may not
  serve you well."- Your First Leadership Job, page 29


  As you embark on your new role as a leader, your new team will be observing
  you under a microscope! They will form an early judgement about you and your
  capabilities that will end up defining your reputation amongst the team and
  others within the organization. Think about it this way – if a customer has a
  bad experience at a restaurant, will they go back? Most likely not. Will they
  share their negative experience with others? Mostly likely, in some capacity.
  That negative experience with that one customer, one time, can have lasting
  impact on that restaurant. The same goes for your reputation as a leader.


  This concept of being authentic is as critical in your role as a leader as
  anything. Being authentic means that your actions mirror what you believe and
  feel, and that there is no contradiction between what you do and what you say.


  The way to remain authentic and show your integrity to your team is through
  **consistent**, **well-crafted** **conversations** and **behaviors**.

  As a newer leader myself, I found _Your First Leadership Job_ to be a great
  resource to leverage in my own personal leadership journey. Not only is the
  book full of great insights, examples, tools and exercises, their
  [website](http://www.ddiworld.com/yourfirstleadershipjob) has even more bonus
  materials that are extremely helpful for leaders at any level!

> "Nobody comes to his first leadership position knowing everything he needs to succeed." _\- Your First Leadership Job, page 4_

_Your First Leadership Job_ is a book giving new leaders practical, tangible advice as they embark on the journey into their first leadership role. The book is written by Tacy Byham, the CEO of Development Dimensions International (DDI) and Richard Wellins, who is a global expert on leadership development.

This book is very tool heavy, which acts as a great resource for new leaders, but also shares countless examples, case studies, and surveys based on the authors’ and DDI’s extensive industry experience and research.

_Your First Leadership Job_ is broken into two sections:

Part one introduces the concept of a _catalyst leader,_ which is defined as a leader who sparks energy, passion, and commitment in others. Now, any current leader knows the transition from an individual contributor to a manager is, without a doubt, a challenging move. Luckily for the reader, part one lays out the foundation for the necessary fundamental skills that will put you on the path towards becoming a successful and effective catalyst leader.

Part two then dives into more advanced leadership skills where the authors take a deep dive into various required leadership skills such as _coaching, hiring, performance reviews, handling difficult employees, networking_ and _influence_. There is also chapter for first-time female leaders.

_Your First Leadership Job_ can be read cover to cover in detail, or it can be used as a just-in-time resource to focus on the topics that are most relevant to you at that given time. Either way, this book should be viewed as a hands-on resource for all new leaders to have at the ready!

With training, experience, continued growth, and resources like _Your First Leadership Job_, you will be on the right path to becoming a successful leader.

I will end this summary with the same challenge the authors ended the book with… _“When people ask you what you do for a living, tell them you’re a leader.”_
