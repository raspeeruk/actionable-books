  ### 9 Principles for Joyous Living


  > "It has been my observation that most of us do not love ourselves enough."-
  Your Life Is Now!, page 27


  Beneath themes like self-esteem, fear, relationships, forgiveness, health,
  wealth and remaining forever young, each chapter is accompanied by joyous
  living skills. First, here is a summary of the core principles:


  1.  Your life is now. Now is the time to live it!

  2.  Stay joyful and trust your Higher Self to guide you to the things you
  want!

  3.  Stop looking into others’ eyes for validation.

  4.  Our fear is our Higher Self telling us that what we fear, we desire to
  change.

  5.  Right now you have the power to create better relationships.

  6.  Be willing to own your part in any given situation. Then there is no need
  to forgive.

  7.  Tell your body what you want in the positive and your body will oblige.

  8.  It’s your birthright to have success. Believe it’s possible.

  9.  Smile more. Laugh more. Dance more. Your body will mirror that back to
  you!

  ### Healing Your Relationships


  > "How others choose to live their lives is no longer my business."- Your Life
  is Now!, page 37


  Our most important relationship is with ourselves.


  As such, all the caretaking traps many of us fall into merely place our
  desires on hold. Have you ever tried to “fix” someone who doesn’t want to
  change? It doesn’t exactly bring joy, does it?


  The problem is that when we have unresolved issues, we’ll be placed in
  situations where we experience difficulties with others who represent these
  people. This phenomenon is the universe offering us an opportunity to heal and
  transform these unhealthy scenarios to make space for healthier ones.


  Toward that end, we are encouraged to:


  *   Write pages of positive things about people in our lives – especially
  those we find challenging.

  *   For 30 days, express appreciation toward them and watch what happens.

  *   As you increase your focus upon gratitude, one of two things will happen.
  Either those around you will “magically” change or (because the individual is
  no longer a match), you’ll be transported into better situations because
  you’ve changed your vibration. This applies at work, in friendships and other
  contexts.

  *   For the next few days, be who you want to be and not who others expect you
  to be. \[This does not mean you care any less about the people around you.\]


  When we decide to take back our lives, we start to feel better about
  ourselves. When the self-critic emerges, we can empower ourselves and make new
  decisions based on what will please us.


  As a consequence, the peace and understanding you bring to yourself will
  reflect outwardly upon your surrounding world. As Marlene George urges, do not
  consider it selfish to feel good about whom you really are. As you practice
  self-care and self-kindness, you contribute to creating a better planet for
  everyone.


  How would it be to follow your own guidance and trust that you can attain such
  wide-ranging positive impact? I’d say the answer is pretty good!

  ### Self-Esteem: I Am Enough


  > "Affirm: What if tomorrow I was to feel worthy of having all my dreams come
  true?"- Your Life is Now!, page 39


  Marlene starts by painting a picture of those who have wealth and success, yet
  they don’t feel satisfied with what they’ve manifested. They live a life of
  “When I accomplish this…” then I will be happy. Their constant struggle is
  with self-created pressure to achieve more. Striving to create the perfect
  life, no matter how hard they try, success seems just out of reach.


  Do you know anyone like this? Perhaps it’s you. To counteract punishing
  self-talk, George suggests these actions:


  *   Describe your ideal day. Be sure to include how you feel.

  *   Draw yourself full of confidence and feeling good about your future
  dreams.

  *   Prepare a list (as many pages as you can) of empowering words to yourself.
  It could be a sentence or it could be a letter you write to yourself. Examples
  include: _“I am worthy of a healthy body”_, _“I am worthy of having a healthy,
  happy relationship”_ or _“I am intelligent”_.

  *   (If you want a stretch) Look into your eyes and say these affirmations out
  loud.

Drawing upon the teachings of Eastern and Western masters, Marlene George in _Your Life is Now!_ artfully combines principles from Therapeutic Touch, Reiki, CranioSacral Therapy, Holotropic Breath work and other healing modalities to bring us nine tenets for daily life.

As the author herself declares, this work is a product of her journey “from ignorance to enlightenment”. She has struggled with many issues common to us all. When we overcome these barriers, the outcomes we attain are well-captured by her book’s sub-title: Now is the time to live the life you want.
