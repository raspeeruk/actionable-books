  ### Doing is key


  > "The 'Habit of Do' is key to the ZTD system. It's the habit that's missing
  from many other productivity systems, and yet it's the most important. All the
  rest is just busy work if you don't actually do the things on your to-do
  list."- Zen to Done, page 35


  There is a real beauty in having systems and methods for our work. But so
  often the problem becomes that we are managing the system more than we are
  leveraging it to accomplish our work. I have certainly been guilty of this
  when it comes to using systems like Basecamp or Trello to organize and
  maintain workflow. Babauta advocates that instead of focusing on these types
  of systems, we revert to something simpler that requires less time and
  technology so that we can focus on _doing_. It seems like an obvious notion,
  yet one that is often overlooked.


  If you’re curious to see how much time you actually spend taking action (as
  opposed to checking email, answering calls, etc), consider tracking your time
  for a week to take a baseline measurement. I did this as an exercise and was
  very surprised to find that the amount of time I spent taking action was well
  below what I expected.

  ### Do the MITs first


  > "Clear away all distractions, and be sure to focus only on that task until
  it’s done. When you’re done, reward yourself . . . but be sure to move on to
  your next MIT shortly!"- Zen to Done, page 34


  Because we have access to email and social media on our phones, which often
  double as our alarm clocks, it is all too easy to being the day in a chaotic,
  reactionary manner. To counteract this, Babauta suggests what may be the most
  difficult habit of them all for readers to implement – do the most important
  tasks first. Don’t check your email, RSS feeds or social media. Refer to the
  daily list of MITs that you’ve created for yourself and focus on completing
  those first.


  This is a habit that I am in the process of implement in my own life. It has
  been difficult since most of my work is done and saved on Google Drive. It is
  nearly inevitable that I scan through my email on the way to getting to my
  MITs. I’ve started using Word again so that I can work without the Internet in
  the background. Forming this new work routine has been a bit challenging, but
  I can that I am much more effective in getting my work done so that I have
  ample time in my day for living beyond work.

  ### The 10 Habits


  > "I don’t think becoming completely organized and productive in one year is
  such a bad accomplishment."- Zen to Done, page 12


  While there are 10 habits, they can be grouped into four categories –
  **collect**, **process**, **plan** and **do**. These form the foundation of
  _Zen to Done_ and they include:


  *   **Collect** – Have a way to capture everything that is floating around in
  your mind. The idea is to “unclutter” your mind to make it easier to focus on
  a single task.

  *   **Process** – Improves your decision making process in your inbox to avoid
  creating an email mountain. If it takes less than 2 minutes, do the action.
  Otherwise trash it, delegate it, file it or add it as a to-do in your
  calendar.

  *   **Plan** – Set your most important tasks (MITs) for each week and day.
  These should support your larger yearly goals.

  *   **Do** – Focus on doing one task at a time without distraction.

  *   **Simple trusted system** – Rather than creating a complicated system,
  create lists based on context and check them daily.

  *   **Organize** – Find a place for everything that is incoming. Ideally this
  system should be based on your context lists.

  *   **Review** – Create a time to review your system and goals each week to
  ensure that you are on track and making progress.

  *   **Simplify** – Reduce your goals and tasks to the essentials. Again,
  instead of creating unnecessary chaos in your life, go back to basics.

  *   **Routine** – Set and develop routines to create structure for yourself.
  This could include delegating certain tasks to certain days or assigning daily
  activities to a consistent time.

  *   **Find your passion** – Seek work that you are passionate about. This is
  essential to your intrinsic motivation and getting things done.


  It could be easy to get overwhelmed by the potential changes that are
  suggested to improve productivity and organization, but Babauta encourages
  readers to only do 2 to 3 at a time. Additionally, once you have tried them
  all only stick with the ones the best serve you and your work.

> "How soon 'not now' becomes 'never.'" _\- Martin Luther, quoted in Zen to Done, page 77_

At one point or another we have all struggled with productivity and organization. For many (myself included), it’s an evolving and on-going issue in both our work and personal lives. Leo Babauta has long written about productivity, organization and simplicity in his popular blog, Zen Habits. His approach remains simple with a focus on taking action. This philosophy is also reflected in his book, _Zen to Done_**_._**

Frustrated by his own experiences with finding the best methods for organization and productivity, Babauta combined the ideas from [_Getting Things Done_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/getting-things-done/)_,_ [_The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People_](https://www.actionablebooks.com/summaries/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-people-part-1) and other books to create the _Zen to Done_ approach. This book seeks to solve some of the common short falls of these other books and systems such as the fact that they don’t focus on your goals, ask you to implement too many changes at once and are too unstructured for some people. Babauta proposes a series of ten habit changes, which form the _Zen to Done_ approach. Additionally, Babauta encourages readers to go beyond just their work life and let their newly formed habits influence other aspects of their life.
