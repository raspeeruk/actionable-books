  ### Zero-Time Selling Means Now


  > "This is what Zero-Time is about: using absolute responsiveness to reduce to
  zero the amount of time required to convert a sales lead into a satisfied
  customer"- Zero Time Selling, page 34


  The fundamental components to achieve zero-time selling are content and speed.
  Paul argues that quality content that is readily available for the customer
  will increase their ROTI. Instantaneous response to customer inquiries is
  paramount not just for ROTI, but also to maintain a competitive advantage over
  the competition. The process in turn results in converting sales leads into
  satisfied customers. Zero-time selling requires implementing the following
  steps, bearing in mind that it cannot be accomplished overnight and requires
  that a company prioritizes according to their practices:


  1.  **Sell with MILT:** The fundamental underpinning for Zero-Time Selling is
  selling with the Most Impact in the Least Time (MILT).

  2.  **Follow up on 100% of Sales Leads:** Ensure that salespeople follow up on
  every lead ever generated, no exceptions.

  3.  **Always Sell with the Sharp End of the Stick:** The person in contact
  with the customer has to be able to answer any and all types of questions a
  potential client might have.

  4.  **Do Everything Now:** Critically appraise your sales process and
  eliminate time-wasting activities. “_Don’t let Indecent Intervals and Wallet
  Pretexts slow you down.”_

  5.  **Practice Unconditional Support:** Much like unconditional love, practice
  unconditional support. A customer is more likely to remember how you helped
  them in their time of need, rather than the features your product/services
  provide.

  6.  **Provide the Human Touch:** Out with auto-attendants answering in-bound
  calls, in with live humans talking to customers.

  7.  **CRM It:** Any and all interactions should be recorded thoroughly in your
  company’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tool, regardless of an
  individual’s rank in the organization. This mitigates missing any client
  information and ensures continuity in the case of staff changes.

  8.  **Sell Low:** Don’t over promise and under deliver. Also, make sure you
  sell to the decision-maker, who happens to be the individual with the lowest
  responsibility level in your client’s organization (i.e. the person who is
  signing the purchasing order.)

  9.  **Start Small:** Smaller implementations decrease risks for you and your
  client. In addition, you can ensure optimal service delivery by selling based
  on your available capacity.

  10.  **Disqualify the Losers:** Don’t waste time on poorly qualified leads and
  relocate those resources to prospects that need your product/service.

  ### Sell With The Sharp End of The Stick


  > "The sharp end of the stick goes into the mammoth; the butt end of the spear
  sits flat on the ground and tries to stay out of harm’s way"- Zero Time
  Selling, page 45


  If you’re out hunting with a spear, you generally have a good idea that it’s
  the sharp end that you need to direct towards your unsuspecting prey.
  Translated into zero-time selling, Paul argues that your salespeople need to
  have deep product knowledge. With technical information readily available by a
  subject matter expert, positioning them closest to customers increases your
  responsiveness in addition to eliminating any extra steps and time it takes to
  “get-back” to them with the right information. The result is increasing the
  customer’s ROTI, because the right information is available at the right time
  during the sales process. Furthermore, he argues that there is no such things
  as being over responsive, which may come off as “too eager”.

  ### Treat Your Sales Like A Scratch-off Instant-Win Lottery Ticket


  > "Any Salesperson who can’t be bothered to respond to the lead is just
  leaving money on the table"- Zero Time Selling, page 40


  The author compares leads to scratch-off lottery tickets, where both have the
  potential of paying off – the lottery odds are slimmer – yet not every lead is
  treated like a lottery ticket. Paul argues that a lead is a lead – otherwise
  it wouldn’t be a lead – and there is no such thing as a “bad lead”. All leads
  have the potential of paying off and that can only be ascertained once they
  are qualified by following up. The simple-fix to this situation is following
  up on 100% of all leads. Paul points out that with zero-time selling, sales
  personnel should follow up with leads within 30 minutes.
f_conclusion: >-
  _Zero-Time Selling_ was a good read. It has plenty of practical examples and
  easy to implement solutions that any buyer can find useful in the current
  cyber-market climate. Paul shares strategies to empower customers with the
  right information, and how to deliver it instantaneously.

> “The race doesn’t go to the swift; it goes to the responsive” _\- Zero Time Selling, page 13_

Andy Paul’s _Zero Time Selling_ identifies key steps for optimal selling in an information-driven cyber world. More so than ever, customers are using the internet to collect information about a firm’s products and services, prior to initiating any contact. With 70-80% of the initial research conducted online, _Zero Time Selling_ is a methodology that empowers your customer to make an informed decision and increase their Return On Time Invested (ROTI) by selling with Maximum Impact in the Least Time (MILT) possible.

### Sell With The Sharp End of The Stick

_Zero-Time Selling_ was a good read. It has plenty of practical examples and easy to implement solutions that any buyer can find useful in the current cyber-market climate. Paul shares strategies to empower customers with the right information, and how to deliver it instantaneously.

Recognizing that zero-time selling doesn’t occur overnight, a big factor is appropriately qualifying leads. Paul argues that: _“A prospect that buys from your competitor was not a qualified prospect for you.”_ I am inclined to somewhat agree with the Paul’s statement, however I’m not sure it is applicable in all cases, because not every industry is the same and every customer has unique needs. Any thoughts?
