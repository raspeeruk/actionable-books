  ### Let’s give them something to talk about


  > "No one believes how amazing your business is if you’re the one who has to
  tell them."- Zombie Loyalists, page 13


  One of the themes throughout the book is to get your customers so excited
  about your product, service, or business that they share their experience with
  others, that they infect others with their enthusiasm. It’s not enough for
  _you_ to talk about how good you are. You have to be so good that you inspire
  other people to talk about you.


  Early in the book, Shankman cites a statistic that 80% of businesses think
  they are good at customer service, but only 8% of customers think they receive
  good customer service. That doesn’t mean that 92% of customers are receiving
  bad service. They just aren’t receiving great service. Customers have low
  expectations so it’s easy for you to wow your customers with just a little
  effort. And once you wow them, you’ve taken a step toward building a zombie
  loyalist.

  ### Own your mistakes


  > "You’re going to screw up. It happens to everyone. As we said before,
  though, the key is what you do next."- Zombie Loyalists, page 171


  We may be trying to create zombies, but all companies are made of humans and
  humans make mistakes. There are the little ones: files are lost, pay is
  calculated incorrectly, payments are applied incorrectly, or food is not made
  to order. And there are the big ones: leadership loses focus so culture
  changes, a company tried to do too much and forgets its core business, a
  company suddenly raises prices, or technology just fails.


  Once you realize that the mistake is yours, and hopefully you do, then it’s
  so, so important to first admit that, apologize, and then do your absolute
  best to correct it as quickly and efficiently as possible. It’s not about you,
  it’s about them. So show them that you can make a mistake and still follow
  through on your ability to make their experience amazing. Take a mistake and
  make it a way to share a positive experience instead of a negative one.


  That’s what Domino’s Pizza did on a large scale beginning in 2010. They
  realized that their pizza tasted terrible, service was lacking, and people
  were sharing mostly negative experiences. So they admitted they had a problem.
  Domino’s expanded their menu, created a new pizza recipe, and advertised the
  changes they were making and why. In the process they brought back hundreds of
  lost customers, approval ratings went up, and stock grew by over 400%.

  ### How can we thrill them?


  > "Customer service is no longer about telling people how great you are. It’s
  about producing amazing moments in time and letting those moments become the
  focal point of how amazing you are, told not by you but by the customer you
  thrilled."- Zombie Loyalists, page 113


  Shankman does a great job of highlighting companies who create amazing moments
  for their customers. While I don’t work directly with customers anymore, our
  sales representatives, managers, and future recruits are my “customers”. I’m
  reminded of a contest that we ran last fall. We simply gave away Amazon gift
  cards in a drawing to managers that participated in a social media scavenger
  hunt at an annual conference. Melissa, our Corpus Christi, TX manager, posted
  on Facebook thanking us for her gift card and telling us what she planned to
  purchase with it. _That’s_ what Shankman is talking about! Simplicity and
  appreciation.


  We have contests periodically but _Zombie Loyalists_ gave me ideas on ways to
  show appreciation for our people in a “random acts of kindness” sort of way.
  Who doesn’t love swag? What if we send out a piece of branded swag or a
  Starbucks gift card for mentioning us on social media? There’s no contest. We
  don’t announce it. We just send it. It’s a nice gesture and some of them will
  be excited enough to share, to be loyal, and to brag about how great we are.
  Like Amy Nowacoski. Amy is the founder of a running group. She blogs about
  running and has mentioned that she likes LaraBar. LaraBar noticed and sent Amy
  a package of products. Of course Amy posted a photo online and blogged about
  it. Periodically they still send her LaraBars. They have made her feel like
  not only a valued customer but a VIP and Amy said it has created loyalty for
  her over any other similar product.

  "Imagine if you could make your customers so in love with you, so amazed at
  their experience with you, each and every time, that they’d have no choice but
  to tell the world how great you are?"

> "Imagine if you could make your customers so in love with you, so amazed at their experience with you, each and every time, that they’d have no choice but to tell the world how great you are?" _\- Zombie Loyalists, page 12_

Zombies are “in” right now so I figured it was about time that I jumped on the bandwagon, as did author Peter Shankman when he designed the theme of his book, _Zombie Loyalists: Using Great Service to Create Rabid Fans._ Shankman spends close to 240 pages teaching through stories of good and not so good service. His main themes are top down leadership, valuing and empowering employees, culture, looking for lots of ways to make your customers feel great, and thinking outside the box to get all those things done.

Oh, and Shankman also reminds us what it means to be a zombie, in case there are no _Walking Dead_ fans reading. Zombies have a singular focus on feeding, they feed in packs, and they infect others. So use his book to make your customers so loyal that that they have a singular focus to “feed” on your product or service and that they “infect” their friends and bring them to “feed” as well!

Are we having fun yet?

“Go forth and provide amazement,” Shankman writes. “Have fun doing it. Make sure your employees have fun doing it. Zombie Loyalists breed well only in the presence of happy employees who like to have fun.”

There were so many great ideas and tidbits in this book that it would be impossible for me to share them all. Not all of them applied to my business, but I’m sure you’ll find some that you can apply. Ultimately, Shankman gives many, many shining examples of how companies not only provide amazing experiences, but that they have fun while they are doing it. Infect the zombies, breed the loyalty, be amazing. And tell us about it in the comments below!
