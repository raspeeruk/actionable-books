As a consultant, I work with entrepreneurs and senior leaders through periods of significant change in their organizations, by delivering strategies, new programs, and coaching to build the workplace foundation they need to shift their company to new levels. My work with Actionable as a Coach, workshop developer, and #BizBkchat moderator gives great joy to my inner book nerd. I am also a Board member for Lymphoma Canada (www.lymphoma.ca), a national cancer charity.
