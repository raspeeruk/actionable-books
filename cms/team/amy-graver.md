I am the owner and Creative Director of Elements, my design agency that I started January 1999. During my day job, I oversee all projects the that come through the studio. Our design work has been recognized and awarded internationally by leading industry publications such as Print, Package Design Magazine, HOW, Graphic Design USA, and more. In my past life, I studied art from a very young age and went onto college earning a degree in Journalism and Photography while becoming a photojournalist for The Boston Globe. I loved using my creative skills together with my writing to visually create and tell stories. I adapted all my various skills – art, writing, photography - into my role as a graphic designer and named my company to represent all the “elements” that go into great design - strategy, illustration, photography, writing, design. I enjoy finding communication solutions and helping my clients succeed. I am also a contributing writer to several publications and I enjoy teaching - following in my family’s footsteps - by giving seminars, guest lecturing and speaking to various organizations on topics related to design and digital media. In 2012, I wrote my first book, “Best Practices for Graphic Designers, Grids & Page Layouts” and I am currently writing my second book, “The Package Design Idea Book”, which is slated for publication in 2016.Somehow, I found the time to marry my high school sweetheart and have two beautiful children who we are raising in the same hometown we grew up in - a little town by the sea called Branford. Our studio is in the historic home of Willis Russell, who was the son of Reverend Russell, one of the founders of Yale University. I’ve come full circle – and I am loving it.
