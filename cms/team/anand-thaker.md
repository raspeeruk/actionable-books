Anand truly enjoys uplifting and serving as a great promoter of others. In the mix and just below the surface, he does play the role of a Yoda by leveling-up and advising practitioners, thought leaders, investors, and entrepreneurs in marketing technology. Over 15 years, he's enabled marketers to own their operations and alignment challenges by better wielding data, technology, process, and people.Heâ€™s transformed enterprise firms (Siemens, IBM, NYSE), enabled companies for high-growth (Silverpop, Terminus), and started few on his own to extend empowering others (NeoMarketing, Analyze123, FatKat II). Also, he works closely with the local Atlanta startup ecosystem and local political processes.After much patience and meditation, Anand is currently exploring how to enable smarter marketers through decision support and marketing intelligence.
