I’ve had a very eclectic career, from leadership roles in the non-profit sector, to working in government on women’s issues to being a magazine editor and then my own business. In 2003 I started Company of Women to support women entrepreneurs and we host over 80 events a year. I write for Huffington Post, as well as online publications in the UK and US. I have written three books on women and business, and am working on a fourth. I am married, have two daughters and live on a farm.
