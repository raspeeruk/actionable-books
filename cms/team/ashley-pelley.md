Words have always been food for me – once I pick up something to read, I can’t put it down. Words nourish my mind, whether through imagination or knowledge. And, I am a little bit nosy. I love learning how great people have become great. I love learning how great people think. Their words give us a little sneak peek into their lives and teach us how we too can be great. I’ve been using the Actionable Book Summaries since the early beginning, and the chance to be able to give back is one that I am grateful for. When I am not reading and writing, I am the sales promotion coordinator for Vector Marketing Canada. I love cooking (but hate following recipes) and have a dream to be able to share that love of cooking with others. I have recently completed my BA in Sociology from McGill University.
