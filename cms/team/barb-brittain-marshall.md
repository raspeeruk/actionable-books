Barb Brittain-Marshall is addicted to reading. Seriously, it has become a bit of a problem. Stacks of books clutter her home. She fears an intervention is close at hand. In the meantime,she keeps running. Running her own Human Resources consulting shop, running a blog, literally pounding the pavement, and shuttling her 3 kids around. Barb is very enthusiastic about running...and reading.
