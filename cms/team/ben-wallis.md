WHO ARE YOU?Ben Wallis: husband, new father, and salesman. WHAT DO YOU DO?I work for eShipping, a logistics technology company in the role of Business Development Manager. We work with companies in the area of transportation. WHY DID THE ACTIONABLE BOOK CLUB RESONATE WITH YOU?I am always interested in personal growth and becoming “more” each day. My goal for 2013 was to develop a more systematic way to read, review, and create action steps from all the mounds of information that exists out there. When this opportunity came along, I knew I had to be a part! I’m excited to be a part of this group!LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/bwallis
