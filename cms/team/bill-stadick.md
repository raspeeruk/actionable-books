I studied poetry and English literature in college then debt-stumbled into advertising, a job where words actually mattered. A few decades into it now, I recently left a communications firm in Wisconsin to start Page 17, Inc., a freelance writing company. The only thing I don't love about reading is it keeps me from writing (bet you can guess the only thing I don't like about writing).
