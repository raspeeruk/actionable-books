I help nonprofits and changemaking organizations become adaptive problem-solvers in the 21st century. My approach includes design thinking, applied creativity, process design, and helping senior leaders apply it to strategy and large-scale social challenges. Reading business books is the fastest track to learning. I like to take those bleeding-edge ideas from the 50000 ft view and turn them into actionable tactics at ground zero. Other than that, I love tea, wine, 1700s/1800s English prose, connecting with purpose-driven people, and anything outdoors-y.
