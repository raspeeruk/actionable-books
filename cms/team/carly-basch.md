Since the beginning my life has been transformed by the power of stories and how the human imagination and motivation revolves around it. I went to school wanting to be a writer/director and walked away with a chance to work in tech sales.Now, I get to tell, share and create stories with businesses; enabling them to have the right tools so they can tell their story to customers, the way they envisioned it.In my spare time, I like to walk dogs and find excuses to eat out for dinner.
