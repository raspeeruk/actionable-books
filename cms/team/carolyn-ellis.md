  "Information without action might be interesting, but it's pretty much
  useless. When you combine information WITH action, that's when you get the
  wisdom, experience and confidence to take you anywhere."

I bring a unique set of skills and training to my clients as a visual facilitator, trainer, award-winning business coach and author. I combine my deep intuitive abilities with my Harvard-trained brain and life-long love affair with colorful markers to help decision-makers and leaders inspire, clarify and unleash the brilliant potential within individuals and organizations. As an Actionable Consultant, I support my clients in developing sustainable leadership and engaged teams from the inside out using cutting-edge business and human potential knowledge. As a graphic recorder and facilitator, I create captivating infographics, sketch notes and full-size visual murals in real-time. This helps decision-makers, audiences, clients, and stakeholders literally "see what they mean" which in turn builds trust, fosters breakthrough thinking and gets everyone on the same page (pun intended).Professionally, I have worked in both the private and public sector, as well as been on the entrepreneurial path for the last 12 years. I am a member of the International Forum of Visual Practitioners. I've worked on Wall Street, served as a senior policy advisor in government and was the Director of Develop for two of the top independent schools in Canada. When I'm not creating or doodling something or transforming a business, I enjoy musical theatre, hot yoga and I'm a huge Star Trek fan.
