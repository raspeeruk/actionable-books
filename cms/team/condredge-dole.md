Condredge is an entrepreneur and web designer who is the founder of Sweet Little Websites which focuses on creating simple, beautiful and - most of all - effective websites from small businesses. He is passionate about the fact that the web is the great equalizer; that it gives scrappy little start-ups with something to say a chance to rise to the top. Condredge was drawn to Goose Educational Media because of his love of learning, creativity and helping others.
