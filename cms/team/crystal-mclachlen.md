I am a 29 year old woman who loves life, and everything that it has to offer. I am a firm believer that we are given a gift of infinite possibilities so long as we are willing to work for it and put ourselves out there. I am passionate about many things, including the company that I work for, people, travelling, good coffee, books and personal development. I am an eternal optimist with an unquenchable curiosity and thirst for knowledge, and love learning. It is my goal to impact the world in a positive way, and leave it better than I found it. I am located in London, Ontario.Professionally, I am currently working as a Shift Supervisor at Starbucks Coffee Company and in my free time I am involved with a Non-Profit dedicated to attracting and retaining young talent in the city of London called Emerging Leaders where I sit on the Advocacy Committee. Being an avid reader, I have always enjoyed discussing books with others, but after learning that this was a program aimed at personal and professional development, I knew that there was an opportunity for a huge amount of personal growth. The most important aspect of ABC to me is not just the reading of the book, but the opportunity to connect with and learn from other individuals who are passionate about developing themselves and others.LinkedIn: http://lnkd.in/aEFtnQ
