I consider myself an idea machine and seeker for knowledge, inspired by life's great possibilities and choices. I am an incrementalist, shifting between phases of dreaming and doing. I always keep my eyes open for partnerships, organizational tools and resources to leverage ideas. I'm considered an INFP and in love with perspective and harmony. I spend my days as an IT Business consultant and Zhineng Qigong Instructor and I am always in for a good conversation with a cup of coffee or tea.
