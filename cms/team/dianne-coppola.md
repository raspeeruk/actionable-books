I am passionate about leadership development, change management, community collaboration and…reading! I’ve been writing for the Actionable Book Club since 2014 and love to share my book insights with folks like you. As a freelance facilitator, trainer and blogger, I focus on helping individuals, teams and multi-stakeholder groups improve their performance through effective planning, team-building and evaluation! I am fond of inspirational quotes, Earl Grey tea, dry white wines and all things chocolate! For fun I hike, cycle, travel and enjoy spending quality time with family/friends.
