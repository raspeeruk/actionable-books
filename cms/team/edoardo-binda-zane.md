Edoardo Binda Zane is a Berlin-Based business coach. He repurposes skills from far-away areas like Management, Theatre and Psychology to help companies reinvent themselves. His focus is on business creativity and strategy and he likes to debunk management myths such as "Brainstorming is good" based on academic researches and papers. His writing style is extremely practical and direct; his book's aim is to be understandable and useful rather than formal and complex.
