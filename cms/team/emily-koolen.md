  knowing that you will take something away from it."

Emily is an HR Pro who started out as "Corporate" but left when she realized that her mindset was better suited to building and developing as a sole focus. She now splits her time as a HR/OD Consultant growing various organizations and as a Career and Executive Coach helping all sorts of people through their own change. Always learning and adding new skills, this CHRP and certified coach is also crazy proud of her busy family, never saying no to volunteer work and finding new ways to find adrenaline rushes!
