Erin grew up in Eagle Idaho where her youthful passion for horses developed into a skill for training and competing. Her gift for managing and organizing showed up at an early ageâ€”from being a leader in her 4-H Club to becoming editor-in-chief of her high school yearbook. Erin has a BA in Elementary Education and Mathematics from Boise State University and integrates her love of learning and logic into her style as a business coach and trainer. She has assisted over 25 business start-ups using her wide range of skills in all aspects of business operations: hiring, training, sales, accounting, logistics, marketing, project management, and strategic planning.
