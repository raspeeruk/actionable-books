I am an avid advocate of the essential role people play in delivering outstanding business results. As a career HR professional with over 10 years experience managing HR functions within the private sector, it is the identification and development of talent and collaboration of talent across all facets of a business that leads to innovation and excellence. I have had the privilege of working with professionals across many different industries (CPG to mining to hospitality) and value the benefits these differing perspectives bring to the business world.I am equally passionate about time spent outside the business world and strive to have the same dedication and focus to ensure these interactions and relationships are valued and fun! Balance is a tricky concept, but it is absolutely an individual concept that evolves as we move through different stages of our personal and professional lives.
