WHO ARE YOU?Gregoire James is President & CEO of GeneraCycle Inc. a small start up with a big question. Why do we have landfill? GeneraCycle's Vision is, “a 100% landfill free globe by 2040.” GeneraCycle will realize its vision by creating a globally adopted and implemented system of commonly used and reused resources. Prior to founding GeneraCycle in May 2009, Mr. James worked in corporate real estate representing private and institutional clients as an advisory and transactional agent. It was while working in this capacity that he uncovered a gap between waste and recycling.WHERE ARE YOU (GEOGRAPHICALLY)?Toronto, Ontario, CanadaWHAT DO YOU DO?Gregoire James builds a custom platform for small to large institutional grade companies so that they may have a landfill free operation.WHY DID THE ACTIONABLE GUEST WRITING PROGRAM RESONATE WITH YOU?The guest writer program initially revolved around accountability and learning, the motivation for the original interest. Overall the prospect of sharing my passions and ideas about the environment in conjunction with learning and sharing the importance of accountability was tantamount to anything else.
