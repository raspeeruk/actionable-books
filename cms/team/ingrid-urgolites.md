  "The secret to solid business relationships is respect. Things, services, and
  jobs are widely available and it's hard to compete. When you make others feel
  important and valuable they choose you."

I work for Citigroup in operations. I have a varied background, and I enjoy service-oriented work. In addition to business, I have a keen interest in food and nutrition, and I have been vegetarian or vegan my whole life. I enjoy the creative process of cooking and making other things. I read and exercise daily. Most of all I like a challenge even when I fail, I always feel like a winner for the experience.
