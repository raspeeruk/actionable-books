Lebanese IT professional, a poet and coach, I believe that being on good terms is the cornerstone of acceptance and with acceptance one can purge his mind from all impurities and live a life full of peace, love and success. I believe that everyone of us has a ONE sense, theONEsense exists to be discovered and once you discover it and control it, you can claim your existence. This only can be achieved by acquiring knowledge and putting it into action. The model I live by is Proact-Learn-Evolve.
