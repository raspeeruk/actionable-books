As a chief librarian, I'm passionate about libraries, collaboration and life-long learning. Life brings serendipity; I started out as a visual arts major. What I learned in art school has had huge impact in my career, teaching me to think creatively, to be comfortable with the messiness of working with vague ideas, and trusting that all will come out right in the end. (Sometimes not, but that's OK too.) As a learner, reader and library leader, I believe strongly in helping others achieve their best. After all, we're all so much stronger when we're connected and sharing what we're learning.
