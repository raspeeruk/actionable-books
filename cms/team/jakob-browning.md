  "Listen to audiobooks while driving, running, or even washing the dishes. This
  practice has helped me have a ready supply of new ideas to apply even when I
  haven't had time during the week to read."

I am Jakob Browning. This fall I'll start my final year of law school. I enjoy running long distances. I have three younger brothers who will all probably be taller than me soon. Iâ€™ve been married for nearly 3 years, and my wife is still kind enough to laugh at (most of) my jokes. I like to tinker with technology in an attempt to make life easier and more efficient. Most people call it being a nerd.
