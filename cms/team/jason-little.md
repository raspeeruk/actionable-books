  "The notion of 'leaving your emotions at the door' when you arrive at work is
  ridiculous. Be who you are and bring your whole self to work. You'll find your
  tribe."

Jason began his career as a web developer when Cold Fusion roamed the earth. Over the following years, he moved into management, Agile Coaching and consulting. The bumps and bruises collected along the way brought him to the realization that helping organizations adopt Agile practices was less about the practices, and all about change.In 2008 he attended an experiential learning conference about how people experience change and since then, he's been writing, and speaking, all over the world.
