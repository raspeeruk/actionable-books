Jean-Marie is managing a new product development team in a Swiss company that builds connectors. He is also passionate about wine and organizes events to share his passion with as many people as possible. But above all he is a dreamer who recently discovered that a small group can make a big difference and change the rules of the game...and he really wants to take part in the journey.
