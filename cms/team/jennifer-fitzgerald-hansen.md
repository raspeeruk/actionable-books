  "Breath. Too often we jump into a project/task without taking the time to
  breathe first, so plan, look around, ask, do research, set goals. Take the
  time at the front end to save you time later!"

Who am I? I ask myself that all the time! I am a mother to three wonderful kids and a self employed trainer/facilitator/instructional designer for 10+ years. Before that I worked in municipal government. I recently went back to the University of Toronto to get another degree, in Mental Health Studies. I have a rescue dog who I love to walk by the lake and my passions include self improvement and empowerment, teaching, and those moments when my students get that if they change themselves, they change their situations!
