WHO ARE YOU?I'm a wife, a daughter, a sister, a friend. I'm a saleswoman, a rain-maker, a dragon-slayer. I like shoes, handbags, a cold gin & tonic on a hot summer day. I read, I doodle, I cook. I enjoy wine. I have a cat named Trixie, goldfish, koi, and the resident wildlife - deer, foxes, hummingbirds, snakes. I dream of a home by the sea.WHERE ARE YOU (GEOGRAPHICALLY)?Central Texas, USA, between Austin & San AntonioWHAT DO YOU DO?Education sales executive with 10 years experience in disruptive technology, curriculum integration, SaaS. Primarily focused on new business development with an emphasis on relationship and solution selling.WHY DID THE ACTIONABLE BOOK CLUB RESONATE WITH YOU?Since I've been focusing on personal development recently, I am excited by the opportunity to share tactics and strategies with a group of like-minded professionals. ABC provides the opportunity to not just read more widely but to share best practices from the books we're reading and to incorporate those ideas into our personal & professional lives. The community accountability aspect really speaks to me, and I can't wait to get started.LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/jenniferknighton
