Everything I do is focused on improving patient outcomes. I do that by being a student and teacher of ethical, effective influence. I teach pharma people and health care professionals how to improve their ability to influence others. Or if you like more traditional titles, I'm an author and speaker on behaviour change in healthcare. I love it! I get goose bumps when I see the ah-ha's in my audience and I know that patients somewhere will benefit.
