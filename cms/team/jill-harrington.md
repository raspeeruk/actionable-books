A hunger to learn, the obsessive stalking of successful sales professionals and a sincere interest in people and business took her from front line to executive suite. As president of salesSHIFT, she helps sales teams from diverse industries shift the way they think and act, enabling them to drive bigger results in highly competitive markets. Her brand of fresh thinking and “tell it as it is” communication style has garnered stellar reviews from conference audiences on four continents.
