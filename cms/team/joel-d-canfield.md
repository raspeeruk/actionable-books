  money is wrong. Measure your wealth by how much time you spend doing what you
  love. Love people. They need it."

I'm a creative who works mostly with words, sometimes accompanied by music. I write because I have to, and I have very little patience with money and its attendant issues. Not precisely minimalist (I own more musical instruments than most folks) but I prefer the simplest life I can arrange.Two years ago my Best Beloved and I left our home behind to travel full time throughout the US and Canada with our Little One. We now live 40 miles from where I was born. We might stay awhile, though eventually we'll settle permanently in Co. Kerry, Ireland.Rice Lake, Wisconsin is about 2 hours NE of St. Paul, 7 hours NNW of Chicago, and 4 hours south of the Canadian border.I write mysteries and business books. I help others get their books out of the 'someday' box with coaching and publishing assistance. I've been a web designer for more than 15 years.I love discussing books, and taking practical action from the lessons I learn, but I'm very good at creating an echo chamber in my work. Hearing other voices is critical to my personal growth.
