WHERE ARE YOU (GEOGRAPHICALLY)?Toronto, Canada WHAT DO YOU DO?Director of Operations for a company that conducts independent medical/psychological assessments. Linked with a network of healthcare professionals. Clients include insurance companies and law firms. WHY DID THE ACTIONABLE GUEST WRITING PROGRAM RESONATE WITH YOU?I’m excited to connect with a group of quality writers who are committed to reading and writing and then sharing their learning. The discipline of reading the books in enough depth to write and share the information will help me learn and grow and I hope I can inspire the rest of the team also.
