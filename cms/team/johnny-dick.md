Born and raised in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Johnny grew up working at his family's car dealership where he learned a lot about selling and customer service. Having graduated from the University of Guelph with a degree in Food Science, Johnny decided not to pursue a career in that industry as the world of sales is what excited him the most.Moving to Toronto a few years ago Johnny reunited with a friend who had started a company called Wishabi.ca. Johnny was hired on in a business development role and is currently the VP of BD for Wishabi.ca.
