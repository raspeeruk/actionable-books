I was born and raised in a home with two parents who love me and two older sisters who tormented me (just kidding, we actually get along!). I learned about frugality and work ethic working in my Dad's business since age 8. At age 16, I started to uncover meaning in life. Today, I'm growing in the grace and knowledge of Jesus and I strive to be humble, wise, and excellent in every endeavor. I want to love people super well. It takes a proper heart & skill to love. How can I benefit people/society?
