I spent 20 years working with airlines, mainly in management, then years as a Realtor®. My current “occupation” is working on a website and business I plan to launch soon. In addition to reading, I love to spend time with family and travel. Our family continues to grow, with 7 grandchildren and one more on the way, so my husband and I spend quite a bit of time just keeping up with all of them!
