I help accountancy firms navigate the murky waters of online marketing. It's a fascinating combination - accountants tend to be nervous about dipping their toe in, and online marketing itself says "Let's try it all!" But it works well, and accountants find it helpful that I can see both sides.To keep my creative mind alive, I also own a photography business, and love capturing people and beauty the world over. I also collect giraffes.
