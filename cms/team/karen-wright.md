I am a Master Certified Coach and recent author of my own book, "The Complete Executive - The 10-Step System for Great Leadership Performance". I work with game-changers, innovators and entrepreneurs to catalyze their best leadership capabilities such that they're fully equipped to do their great work. When I'm not reading business books I do yoga, run, cycle and act as chef and chauffeur for two teenaged boys.
