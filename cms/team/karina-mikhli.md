  "Keep it simple. What you're doing either works or it doesn't and if it
  doesn't, try something else--and ask for feedback. This applies to the service
  you're selling and to the people you're managing."

Although I've spent most of my career on the operations side of publishing, an industry I'm still fortunate to be working in, I've also been a teacher and personal trainer in what feels like previous lives. When not working, I run several book clubs via Meetup, love books and words (book buying is my retail therapy of choice), and am a wife and mother. I hope to some day help build a great company and culture. Business books are my MBA of choice.
