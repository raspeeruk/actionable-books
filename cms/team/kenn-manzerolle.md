I am a married father of four, who is on the verge of expanding our family to include adopted children from Haiti. My family is my reason for being, and everything I do, is intended to help guide and assist them in reaching their goals and sharing the love and abundance we have with others.I am active with my children, either as a coach or volunteer, and love to watch others reach levels of success they never dreamed possible. I have recently started my own sales and marketing consulting firm, with a focus on small to medium sized Consumer Packaged Goods businesses. In my down time, I run, read, and spend quiet moments with the family.
