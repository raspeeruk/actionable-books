Lindsay started her professional career as an accountant, moved on to HR and when she couldn't make up her mind on those two completely different career options choices, she focused on Entrepreneurship...and it fits her well! Having worked full time with Goose Educational Media and actionablebooks.com for a year and a half, Lindsay has launched her career as a consultant. With extensive experience in mentoring and guiding, Lindsay has created HR recruiting, on-boarding, retention and training programs, each including a feedback and change procedure built in, ensuring employee and management support and buy-in for the new processes.Although she doesnâ€™t drive a big truck, Lindsay is a true Prairie Girl. Living in her hometown of Calgary, Alberta, she faithfully watches the Minnesota Vikings, loudly cheers for her Calgary Flames and always supports her Calgary Stampeders. Lindsay also trains at the gym, reads a lot and tries her best at gardening the tomato plants.
