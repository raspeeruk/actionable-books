I am an executive leadership coach, business strategist, app developer (aka geek princess), avid reader, energetic mom, great advocate of learning for your entire life and focused on seeing others be successful. I love seeing the 'ah-ha' moments in my clients' eyes. My experience in the corporate world gives me a unique lens through which to see business and business development. My clients say I have a knack for pinpointing issues and developing actionable solutions.
