I am fascinated with human performance. It has played a central role in the tapestry of my personal and professional development. My interest in human behavior has given me opportunities working in sales at a leading health retreat, marketing NLP training programs, National Education Manager at Estee Lauder, & corporate facilitation at INFORM Training. I am captivated about humanizing leadership. I work with leaders so that they can tap into their own potential & amplify the talent around them.
