Once an enlisted Marine, I am an adult nurse practitioner and clinical nurse specialist where I use influence, innovation, and evidence to improve healthcare delivery. I love reading and writing and I have a love-hate relationship with running. Sometimes running is the only thing that keeps me sane and other times I need cues that this is important for my emotional and physical well-being. I'm a married cat lady and have two teens who challenge me with their exuberance and promise.
