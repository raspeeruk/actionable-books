Matthew E. May is an innovation strategist and the author of five books, the latest being Winning the Brain Game: Fixing the 7 Fatal Flaws of Thinking. He writes the bimonthly Brain Game column for INC magazine, and his work has appeared in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, AMEX Open Forum, Strategy+Business, Rotman Magazine, Fast Company, and the Harvard Business Review blogs. Matt holds an MBA from the Wharton School and a BA from Johns Hopkins University, but he counts winning the New Yorker cartoon caption contest as one of his most creative achievements.
