Actionable Books' very own Happiness Hero, I started my career in advertising and marketing after completing a Bachelor of Arts at Deakin University in Melbourne.I received my position at Actionable Books after sending Chris Taylor, the Founder and President of Actionable Books, an email practically begging him for a job. Lesson: Never be afraid to ask.I love yoga, baking and, of course, reading, and I have high hopes of writing my own book one day.
