Melanie's grandfather calls himself a "jack of all trades, and master of most," and she's hoping to carry on the family tradition. She has a background in journalism, and experience in native advertising, social media strategy and content marketing. She's passionate about helping both people create quality content online and in print, and since knowing your audience is key to reaching them, Melanie reads a lot about psychology, sociology, group dynamics and communication.
