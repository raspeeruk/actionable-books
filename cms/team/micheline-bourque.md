  "I once told a client who was finding it hard to work as a freelancer, why not
  partner up with someone? She did. That changed her life. My thrill: to be
  there at the right time with the right advice."

In 2014, a light lit up when I realized that I could do something fun and interesting with my love of business books and learning. I created the Club de lecture Affaires. My tagline: Learning together through the knowledge of others. I'm dreaming 'Toute la Francophonie'. Before that, I worked and still do, as a marketing consultant, social media trainer and coach, focus group moderator, and a lot of other stuff under the big umbrella of marketing. I'm a hybrid: French/English of Acadian descent.
