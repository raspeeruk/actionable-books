Mike runs a specialist IT company in the East Midlands Region of England, an area known as Leicestershire, which provides solutions to business and schools in that area. Prior to that, he has experience working in massive national and international manufacturing and sales organizations, complemented by working for smaller cutting edge technology companies. Since reading "What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School" in 1984, Mike has been fascinated by the ideas and thoughts of many of the top American specialists. Over the years he's accumulated a library of books and audios by experts such as Brian Tracy, Jay Abraham and many more. Where practical, many of these ideas have been brought in to play in is business life.
