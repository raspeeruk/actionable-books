Nikki Barrett comes to Actionable after a long career bringing ideas to audiences across North America, first in the world of book publishing and, for the last ten years, as Executive Vice President of The Lavin Agency, a speakers agency making the world a smarter place. She has worked extensively with business authors who understand the value of engaged work cultures. Having seen how one or two ideas from a speech might inspire action, she is really excited to champion conversations that truly provoke ongoing change, innovation and renewal.Right now she is reading Virginia Heffernen's Magic and Loss: The Internet as Art and is currently passionate about interior design on a shoestring (creativity with constraints!) and her dog Red who, true to his name, adds much colour to Nikki's world. Recently she discovered how ineffective Skunk-off is as a product.
