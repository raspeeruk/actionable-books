After years in business, I became a certified executive coach. My passion is assisting people in the workplace to overcome obstacles and achieve the most fulfilling success possible, however they may define it. We spend most of our waking hours working; if I can help people be happier and more satisfied, I consider my efforts a success. I’m fascinated with what makes people “tick,” and on finding ways to be productive and happy. A global traveler, I love uncovering how people around the world may be different, yet always the same. When I’m not on the road or at home outside of Chicago, I’m exploring and enjoying the magical island of Nantucket.
