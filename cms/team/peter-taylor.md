I have owned and managed a veterinary based business on the west coast of Australia for 18 years. No one at Veterinary school gives us any clues about running a business and it is only in the last few years that I have started to study business and management. The key, I believe, is understanding yourself, your "why" and remain loyal to that concept to achieve success in business.
