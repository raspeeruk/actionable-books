A freelance blogger, writer and wordsmith based out of the twin-cities of Toronto and Waterloo, Prashanth uses his background in biotechnology, economics, marketing and communications to turn (some) wheels at Goose Educational Media. Pursuing his passion for communicating great ideas to dynamic people, he avidly reads, blogs and opines on a variety of topics. On other occasions, he can be found working, working out or tweeting - though sadly not all at once.
