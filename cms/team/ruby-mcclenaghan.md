I am a Certified Human Resources Professional and a recent graduate just starting out in my career. I am an associate board member of my local chapter of the HRPA. In my spare time I am learning to love running and I am currently training for a 10k in the spring. I love food and beer and I am usually found in the kitchen cooking up something delicious or hosting beer tasting dinners for close friends. For pleasure I publish a beer blog where I chronicle my adventures with food, beer and travel.
