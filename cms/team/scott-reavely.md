I am husband to one, father to five. By day I am a pastor, by night a softball coach for 10 year-old girls. In my free time I serve on the board of Western Seminary. I have found that leading non-profits involves all the fun of "real" business without the money or power! I believe suffering completes our stories. I've had 8 knee surgeries, one shoulder surgery and have lost two children.I love what I do because I love the people I get to do it with and wish everyone had that privilege.
