I love good writing and I am passionate about connecting people with great ideas and with other people, in order to make our lives more sustainable and social. I'm a freelance facilitator, trainer, and lifelong student of how we learn. In my facilitation and training roles, I encourage businesses and social enterprises to share their big ideas and then commit to small actions to bring their visions into reality. On weekends it’s a toss-up between a bush walk, coffee with friends, a bike ride in the national park, a good book, or a dip in the ocean. On a good weekend it's all of these.
