Stacey Hanke, Inc. exists to equip leaders within organizations to communicate with confidence, presence and authenticity, day in and day out. Combined, our team of mentors and consultants has more than 100 years of training experience. We’ve worked with executives, managers, technicians and sales leaders across the United States and on four different continents. Our individual backgrounds are as diverse as news and entertainment, sales and marketing, recruitment, diversity and inclusion, organizational development and investor relations.Several of our team members are keynote speakers. Mentoring works best one-on-one, while workshops typically involve two members of the Stacey Hanke team to allow for the greatest degree of personal contact. Whatever your solution, the goal is always the same: Not to change you, but to help you confidently and consistently express your true self, Monday to Monday.®
