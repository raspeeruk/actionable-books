  "One of the best ways to build a network if you're a consultant is informal
  one-on-one networking. Ask those you trust for suggestions of good people to
  meet and ask for a meeting in person."

I am fascinated by what motivates people, how we communicate with each other and we can perform at our best. As a corporate trainer, I love to learn and share techniques to help people to build skills in communicating effectively, managing work and priorities, and thinking creatively. I work with teams in the finance, banking and technology industries, delivering interactive, practical and fun courses that give participants real tools they can use to do their best work.
