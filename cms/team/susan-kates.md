I have an eclectic background. I have worked in so many different industries, which I think has given me insight that I can use to deal with almost any situation.I am a marketer. I love creating relationships, building relationships and helping others. I love being creative, thinking outside of the box and always trying to find new market opportunities. Sometimes I see opportunities where others see road blocks. I believe in collaboration and believe anything can be done together.
