Initial career choice was policing...until I found out my eyesight didn't meet job requirements. Took temporary work through a placement firm until I could figure out next steps & fell into an awesome 17-year career in staffing & recruitment with that same firm.Built a $20M company in Toronto & Vancouver. Eventually escaped from Bay Street & launched a networking group for professional Moms in Ottawa, then moved into the career & leadership coaching space. Just launched a new partnership!
