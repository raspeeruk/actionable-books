I am from the North East of England. I was born in Birtley Co, Durham on 12-6-1957 so I'm a Gemini. My work has centred around social work and I love everything to do with change and improving people's potential. I have lived in England, Ireland and the Hebridean Islands of Scotland. I returned to North East England in 2000 and I now live In a beautiful sea front property in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear.I have an M Ed in Training and Organisational Development which I am proud to have achieved in my forties. My work has been dangerous, funny and heart warming in various social work roles as I moved jobs when I needed to change and grow. For a time I was the social worker on the Isle of Skye and later on the Isle of Barra a tiny Catholic island in the Hebrides. I also do Business Coaching and Life Coaching and I am on a mission to coach the social care professionals who are tired and burnt out looking for escape so that they can really change the world with their skills and courage.
