  "The very best advice I have (so far) is to tune into how your clients talk
  about their problem. The more you can understand their true pain points, the
  more of an edge you'll have in the market."

I am a fundraising strategist and copywriter, and run the non-profit resource website, Philanthropy For All. Through my work, my goal is to help passionate non-profit folks better articulate their non-profitâ€™s impact and work is a way that translates to engaged philanthropic communities. I've worked in the non-profit sector for over 5 years and started my copywriting and consulting shop in 2012.I enjoy running half-marathons, volunteering and traveling to new places.
