WHO ARE YOU?I am a marketing professor and scholar who, in addition to education, is interested in writing and consulting. I am married with our first child on the way. I'm starting my own side marketing business as a means to supplement my income from teaching and to stay sharp for in class discussions.WHERE ARE YOU (GEOGRAPHICALLY)?I go back and forth between Austin and Houston, TX.WHAT DO YOU DO?Officially, I am a marketing professor.WHY DID THE ACTIONABLE BOOK CLUB RESONATE WITH YOU?ABC resonated with me because I love to read, and frankly, I am going to read 12 books anyways. I thought this would be a nice way to connect with a new group of people and provide additional insights into the books we read.LinkedIn: http://www.linkedin.com/in/billzahn
